This trend highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with 14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates, exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.\nSubjects:\nMachine Learning (cs.LG)\n; Computation and Language (cs.CL)\nCite as:\narXiv:2505.06297\n[cs.LG]\n(or\narXiv:2505.06297v1\n[cs.LG]\nfor this version)\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.06297\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Yu Mao [\nview email\n]\n[v1]\nWed, 7 May 2025 17:42:35 UTC (1,085 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Lossless Compression of Large Language Model-Generated Text via Next-Token Prediction, by Yu Mao and 2 other authors\nView PDF\nHTML (experimental)\nTeX Source\nOther Formats\nview license\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\n<\u00a0prev\n|\nnext\u00a0>\nnew\n|\nrecent\n|\n2025-05\nChange to browse by:\ncs\ncs.CL\nReferences & Citations\nNASA ADS\nGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\na\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibTeX formatted citation\n\u00d7\nData provided by:\nBookmark\nBibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer\n(\nWhat is the Explorer?\n)\nConnected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers\n(\nWhat is Connected Papers?\n)\nLitmaps Toggle\nLitmaps\n(\nWhat is Litmaps?\n)\nscite.ai Toggle\nscite Smart Citations\n(\nWhat are Smart Citations?\n)\nCode, Data, Media\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv Toggle\nalphaXiv\n(\nWhat is alphaXiv?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers\n(\nWhat is CatalyzeX?\n)\nDagsHub Toggle\nDagsHub\n(\nWhat is DagsHub?\n)\nGotitPub Toggle\nGotit.pub\n(\nWhat is GotitPub?\n)\nHuggingface Toggle\nHugging Face\n(\nWhat is Huggingface?\n)\nLinks to Code Toggle\nPapers with Code\n(\nWhat is Papers with Code?\n)\nScienceCast Toggle\nScienceCast\n(\nWhat is ScienceCast?\n)\nDemos\nDemos\nReplicate Toggle\nReplicate\n(\nWhat is Replicate?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nHugging Face Spaces\n(\nWhat is Spaces?\n)\nSpaces Toggle\nTXYZ.AI\n(\nWhat is TXYZ.AI?\n)\nRelated Papers\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nLink to Influence Flower\nInfluence Flower\n(\nWhat are Influence Flowers?\n)\nCore recommender toggle\nCORE Recommender\n(\nWhat is CORE?\n)\nIArxiv recommender toggle\nIArxiv Recommender\n(\nWhat is IArxiv?\n)\nAuthor\nVenue\nInstitution\nTopic\nAbout arXivLabs\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?\nLearn more about arXivLabs\n.\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers?\n|\nDisable MathJax\n(\nWhat is MathJax?\n)", "ped_digest": "P:Lossless compression of LLM-generated text|LLMs can efficiently compress their own outputs|LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates|Advantage holds across different LLM sizes and dataset types;E:Investigation of lossless compression techniques|Extensive experiments with 14 LLMs and 8 datasets;D:Compression rates exceeding 20x|3x rate achieved by Gzip|1,085 KB submission size;R:;", "er_digest": "N:Yu Mao|arXiv|Simons Foundation|Holger Pirk|Chun Jason Xue|cs.CL;", "gist": "P:Lossless compression of LLM-generated text|LLMs can efficiently compress their own outputs|LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates|Advantage holds across different LLM sizes and dataset types;E:Investigation of lossless compression techniques|Extensive experiments with 14 LLMs and 8 datasets;D:Compression rates exceeding 20x|3x rate achieved by Gzip|1,085 KB submission size;N:Yu Mao|arXiv|Simons Foundation|Holger Pirk|Chun Jason Xue|cs.CL;R:;", "entities": ["Yu Mao", "arXiv", "Simons Foundation", "Holger Pirk", "Chun Jason Xue", "cs.CL"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://ecori.org/hopeful-urbanism-human-scale-neighborhoods-more-necessary-than-ever/", "content": "As Providence hosts the 33\nrd\nCongress for the New Urbanism\nfrom June 11-14, it\u2019s a good time to reflect on the value of human-scale neighborhoods as an essential response to the evolving needs of our society. Human-scale neighborhoods \u2014 places that are compact, mixed-use, and walkable \u2014 offer practical solutions to today\u2019s economic, environmental, and social challenges. The blueprint for a better connected and more equitable future is all around us in the DNA of some of our most well-loved (and well-functioning) New England places.\nHuman-scale neighborhoods do more with less and thus make economic sense. For individuals, proximity to jobs and daily needs offers more than just convenience; it can reduce or eliminate the stress of commuting long distances, especially for those more financially vulnerable. For municipalities, focusing development and redevelopment to compact, human-scale places means more efficient infrastructure and lower maintenance costs \u2014 especially critical now as our cities and towns grapple with the twin challenges of stretched municipal budgets and decades of deferred infrastructure maintenance.\nThe national housing shortage has made creating and supporting neighborhoods that more gracefully accommodate diverse needs more urgent. Human-scale communities can address this crisis by more easily accommodating a range of housing options and welcoming additional density. For example, Massachusetts\u2019 MBTA Communities Law requires municipalities to zone for multifamily housing near transit hubs, encouraging density near transit-oriented development.\nHuman-scale neighborhoods are compact and green. At the watershed scale, compact development in areas served by infrastructure (aka\nsmart growth\n) promotes sustainability by reducing the cumulative footprint of development while at the same time striving for maximum conservation and restoration of natural systems. Within neighborhoods themselves, reduced emissions, integrated green spaces, and benefits like mitigating urban heat island effects and reducing stormwater runoff are the keys to sustainability and environmental health.\nHuman-scale neighborhoods are mixed-use and pedestrian friendly. With homes, shops, schools, and parks all within easy reach by foot or bike, and a strong focus on a safe and welcoming public realm (parks, streets, civic spaces), everyday experiences and encounters build social connections and strengthen a neighborhood over time. While sprawling, low-density areas often resist new development due to fears of congestion or loss of character, human-scale, walkable neighborhoods absorb change more naturally. New homes or businesses add to the vitality of the whole, reinforcing a cycle of organic, place-based growth.\nMashpee Commons on Cape Cod offers an example of how human-scale, walkable design can succeed in a variety of settings. What began as the reinvention of a 1960s strip mall evolved into a dynamic mixed-use village designed to become a traditional New England town center. A\nNew Urbanism\npioneer and early smart growth model, Mashpee Commons features walkable streets and a mix of housing, shops, restaurants, and civic spaces, reflecting core principles championed by New Urbanists.\nCurrently a thriving regional commercial draw, recent emphasis has been on adding much-needed residential units alongside commercial growth. The approach addresses regional housing shortages while integrating infrastructure that protects the local ecosystem. First and foremost, the project\u2019s status as a grayfield redevelopment provides tremendous environmental benefit compared to comparable greenfield development. An early investment in on-site wastewater treatment anchors an environmental infrastructure legacy, underscoring long-term foresight.\nWhile Mashpee Commons illustrates how larger-scale development can create connected, walkable neighborhoods, smaller infill \u201cmissing middle\u201d residential projects like Cottages on Greene and Castle Street Cottages in East Greenwich show how thoughtful design can help knit multifamily housing into existing communities. These two \u201ccottage court\u201d mini-neighborhoods cluster small homes around a shared green space, fostering close connections. Drawing on traditional local architecture, the projects fit into their historic surroundings while incorporating sustainable features like energy-efficient heating and stormwater systems. Cottages on Greene won a CNU Charter Award and Castle Street Cottages earned a Best in American Living Award, exemplifying how compact, human-scale neighborhoods preserve character, encourage social interaction, and support environmental responsibility.\nBeyond housing and commercial centers, Providence\u2019s Woonasquatucket Greenway improvements show how public infrastructure investment can help reconnect communities. The project consists of the upgrade of a mile segment of the 7-mile Greenway and includes a new off-street urban trail along the river, two new pocket parks, two new kayak launches, and extensive tree planting and green stormwater infrastructure. The project corridor is gradually transitioning from its long industrial history and subsequent post-industrial disinvestment to accommodate new uses, including arts facilities, community spaces, and additional residents. The Greenway improvements are a step in a long and complicated process, especially with its extensive public engagement process and intent to benefit vulnerable populations with safer streets, more ways to get around, better access to the river, and welcoming public spaces. These elements combine to create social connectivity and improved mental health, cleaner water, and reduced heat island effect.\nThe upcoming Congress for the New Urbanism in Providence is a chance to share ideas, learn from success stories both old and new, and deepen our understanding of how places built for people can help us adapt socially, environmentally, and collectively to a rapidly changing world.\nJon Ford, P.E., is a senior associate for community design at the Horsley Witten Group.\nThe post\nHopeful Urbanism: Human-Scale Neighborhoods More Necessary Than Ever\nappeared first on\necoRI News\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Human-scale neighborhoods are essential for addressing economic, environmental, and social challenges|Compact, mixed-use, and walkable neighborhoods offer practical solutions|Creating and supporting neighborhoods is urgent due to the national housing shortage|Smart growth promotes sustainability by reducing the cumulative footprint of development|Mixed-use and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods build social connections|Grayfield redevelopment provides environmental benefits compared to greenfield development|Infill \"missing middle\" residential projects can knit multifamily housing into existing communities|Public infrastructure investment can reconnect communities|Congress for the New Urbanism is a chance to share ideas and learn from success storiesE:33rd Congress for the New Urbanism hosted in Providence|Reinvention of a 1960s strip mall into Mashpee Commons|MBTA Communities Law requires zoning for multifamily housing near transit hubs|Woonasquatucket Greenway improvements upgrade a mile segment of the 7-mile Greenway|Cottages on Greene and Castle Street Cottages projects foster close connectionsD:Mashpee Commons is a thriving regional commercial draw|Cottages on Greene won a CNU Charter Award|Castle Street Cottages earned a Best in American Living Award|Woonasquatucket Greenway project includes two new pocket parks and two new kayak launches|The Greenway project corridor is transitioning from industrial history to accommodate new usesCape Cod|Massachusetts|East Greenwich|New EnglandHorsley Witten Group|ecoRI News|MBTA Communities Law|New Urbanism|Mashpee Commons|Cottages on Greene|Castle Street Cottages|Woonasquatucket Greenway;", "er_digest": "R:New England|Massachusetts|Providence;", "gist": "P:Human-scale neighborhoods are essential for addressing economic, environmental, and social challenges|Compact, mixed-use, and walkable neighborhoods offer practical solutions|Creating and supporting neighborhoods is urgent due to the national housing shortage|Smart growth promotes sustainability by reducing the cumulative footprint of development|Mixed-use and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods build social connections|Grayfield redevelopment provides environmental benefits compared to greenfield development|Infill \"missing middle\" residential projects can knit multifamily housing into existing communities|Public infrastructure investment can reconnect communities|Congress for the New Urbanism is a chance to share ideas and learn from success storiesE:33rd Congress for the New Urbanism hosted in Providence|Reinvention of a 1960s strip mall into Mashpee Commons|MBTA Communities Law requires zoning for multifamily housing near transit hubs|Woonasquatucket Greenway improvements upgrade a mile segment of the 7-mile Greenway|Cottages on Greene and Castle Street Cottages projects foster close connectionsD:Mashpee Commons is a thriving regional commercial draw|Cottages on Greene won a CNU Charter Award|Castle Street Cottages earned a Best in American Living Award|Woonasquatucket Greenway project includes two new pocket parks and two new kayak launches|The Greenway project corridor is transitioning from industrial history to accommodate new usesCape Cod|Massachusetts|East Greenwich|New EnglandHorsley Witten Group|ecoRI News|MBTA Communities Law|New Urbanism|Mashpee Commons|Cottages on Greene|Castle Street Cottages|Woonasquatucket Greenway;R:New England|Massachusetts|Providence;", "entities": null, "regions": ["New England", "Massachusetts", "Providence"]}, {"_id": "https://animehunch.com/evangelion-va-megumi-hayashibara-invasive-species-remark/", "content": "Renowned Japanese voice actress Megumi Hayashibara, widely known for her role as Rei Ayanami in the anime series\nNeon Genesis Evangelion\n, became the center of an online controversy.\nThe controversy began after Hayashibara published a post on her official\nAmeblo blog on June 8, 2025\n, titled \u201cIndifference, ignorance, and not knowing.\u201d\nIn this post she used the metaphor of \u201cinvasive species\u201d while discussing concerns about foreign tourists and student issues in Japan.\nIn her post, Hayashibara was calling for Japanese citizens to be more politically engaged. And one of the issues she addressed was the financial aid for students.\n\u201c\nUnconditional, free aid for some foreign exchange students. But for Japanese students, it\u2019s scholarships (which you have to pay back, so to put it plainly, it\u2019s debt).\n\u201d\nThis comment touched upon ongoing discussions in Japan regarding the structure of student financial aid.\nData from the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) indicates that a significant portion of aid for domestic students comes in the form of loans that require repayment, while\nvarious scholarships, including those from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), are available to international students, some of which are grants\n.\nShe asked people to go out and vote, adding that if this doesn\u2019t happen then Japan\u2019s \u201cJapan-ness\u201d will be lost,\nwith even the much beloved anime losing its free expression\n.\n\u201c\nIf we stay on this path, Japan\u2019s \u2018Japan-ness\u2019\u2014our manners, our attitude, our technology, and maybe even our anime as a form of free expression\u2014will be lost\n,\u201d she wrote.\nHayashibara also referenced issues related to tourism, alluding to \u201c\nforeign tourists who don\u2019t know the concept of \u2018yielding,\u2019 and even people who carve into the bamboo in Kyoto.\n\u201c\nThis comes at a time when Japan and particularly cities like Kyoto are grappling with the effects of over-tourism, including strains on public infrastructure and incidents of tourists not adhering to local customs.\nShe then continued to say that if Japan doesn\u2019t crackdown on its issues, it will be like the\nJapanese crayfish being devoured by an invasive species\n. This comment drew significant attention and criticism from netizens.\n\u201c\nIf we don\u2019t have regulations, if we don\u2019t properly crack down on this, we\u2019re in trouble\n,\u201d Hayashibara wrote. \u201c\nIt will be like how the native Japanese crayfish were devoured in an instant by an invasive species. For example, it will become a world where unspoken rules, like lining up to buy things, are lost.\n\u201c.\nThis \u201cinvasive species\u201d metaphor was interpreted by many online as a derogatory reference to foreigners. The comment quickly spread across social media platforms, with some users accusing the voice actress of xenophobia.\nMegumi Hayashibara\nSupporters of Hayashibara, however,\nhave argued\nthat her words were taken out of context.\nThey contended that her primary intention was not to criticize foreigners but to express her concern over what she perceives as Japanese public indifference to pressing domestic issues.\nHayashibara herself stated in her post that she was not trying to criticize any specific country.\nShe added that if Japan itself gets exhausted then it won\u2019t be possible to maintain the level of hospitality that it offers to foreign citizens right now.\n\u201c\nShouldn\u2019t Japan\u2019s taxes \u2018first and foremost\u2019 be for the people who paid them (which of course includes tax-paying foreign residents in Japan)? Is it considered exclusionism to think that taxes should be used for Japan\u2019s [disaster-stricken areas] and for the students who are supporting Japan right now? If Japan becomes exhausted internally, we won\u2019t be able to offer \u201comotenashi\u201d (hospitality) anymore.\n\u201c\nThe initial blog post also contained a section discussing Korean politics, which Hayashibara later edited out.\nIn a subsequent update to the post, she issued an apology for this part of her commentary. She explained that a Korean friend had contacted her and pointed out that her remarks could inadvertently fuel political divisions in South Korea.\n\u201c\nI was scolded, being told, \u2018You\u2019re going to fan the flames of an unnecessary conflict\u2019\n,\u201d she wrote. \u201c\nIf there was anyone I hurt, I am sorry. I have omitted that part [of the original post].\n\u201c\nCheck out the translation of her entire edited post below:\nIs this\u2026 really okay?\nI\u2019ve become genuinely worried.\nThe following has been changed:\nWhen I featured a Korean YouTuber, a Korean friend of mine contacted me. They told me that right now in Korea, there\u2019s a conflict between the right and left wings, and if I say something that could be taken as supporting the right, the left will be saddened. Conversely, if I say something that supports the left, the right will be saddened. I was scolded, being told, \u201cYou\u2019re going to fan the flames of an unnecessary conflict.\u201d The fact is that there are people who will be hurt by me, an \u201coutsider,\u201d carelessly bringing up the topic.\nI know it\u2019s late, and this might just add more fuel to the fire, but if there was anyone I hurt, I am sorry. I have omitted that part [of the original post]. I can\u2019t reach out to those who have already been hurt, but I can hope that no more people are hurt.\nI know that this short text can\u2019t possibly convey everything, but what I wanted to say was that it\u2019s just so incredibly sad how Japan is so [indifferent] to its own issues, to the point where even speaking up is met with cynicism.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nNo rice????\nIn Japan???\nUnconditional, free aid for some foreign exchange students.\nBut for Japanese students, it\u2019s scholarships (which you have to pay back, so to put it plainly, it\u2019s debt).\n\u2026this leads to a twisted truth. We can\u2019t just leave it to others; we have to actually go and vote. I think we\u2019ve reached a point where we can no longer afford to use phrases like \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter anyway\u201d or \u201cnothing will change.\u201d\nIf we stay on this path, Japan\u2019s \u201cJapan-ness\u201d\u2014our manners, our attitude, our technology, and maybe even our anime as a form of free expression\u2014will be lost (>\u4eba<;).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMeanwhile, there are some people in private lodgings (minpaku) with no manners, or foreign tourists who don\u2019t know the concept of \u201cyielding,\u201d and even people who carve into the bamboo in Kyoto. If we don\u2019t have regulations, if we don\u2019t properly crack down on this, we\u2019re in trouble.\nIt will be like how the native Japanese crayfish were devoured in an instant by an invasive species.

The Justice Society is\none of DC\u2019s greatest teams\n, having fought evil since the Golden Age. The modern version of the team combines the best heroes of yesteryear with the heroes who have taken up the legacies of the olden days. The latest series has been focusing on the team\u2019s battle with the Injustice Society, an assemblage of the JSA\u2019s greatest foes. This battle has been pretty damaging to the JSA. The team\u2019s core members were pulled into Surtur\u2019s Realm, where\nWildcat died fighting Wotan\n, saving Doctor Fate\u2019s life. The rest of the\nJSA had to deal with a traitor problem\n, all while trying to figure out where their teammates were pulled to and what exactly has been going on in the interim.\nJSA\n#8 is a flashback tale related to the modern story, as the JSA face off against Johnny Sorrow and Wotan in WWII. The issue ends with the revelation of the Injustice Society\u2019s plans.\nThose plans honestly aren\u2019t extremely surprising \u2014 it\u2019s basically something that Johnny Sorrow has tried every time he\u2019s showed up as a villain \u2014 but the fact that he was able to rope the entire Injustice Society into it is a rather big shock. The Injustice Society has done a lot of damage over the years, but this latest scheme is their most destructive. However, I don\u2019t really think it makes sense for most of the group to be involved in this scheme.\nThe Injustice Society\u2019s Latest Plan Could Destroy the World\nThe Injustice Society has had a lot of members over the years. It was first established in the Golden Age comics, and was one of the first supervillain teams as modern readers would recognize them. They\u2019re the same basic premise of the Justice Society; the Justice Society were an assemblage of DC\u2019s greatest heroes, so it stood to reason that the only people who could fight them successfully were an assemblage of their enemies. Classic DC villains like Vandal Savage, the Wizard, Solomon Grundy, and more would join the team, and new versions would show up over the decades, always out to get revenge against the Injustice Society. The Injustice Society has tried to take over the world numerous times over the years, but their attacks usually aren\u2019t heavy on the wholesale damage \u2014 they actually want to have a world to take over, not destroy it. The current team consists of Johnny Sorrow, Wotan, Solomon Grundy, Red Lantern II, Doctor Elemental, Gentleman Ghost, Kobra, Vanderlyle, and the Fog. It\u2019s a great team of villains.\nRELATED:\nThis Is the Best Team Comic Ever (And You\u2019ll Be Surprised)\nJSA\n#8 show Sorrow and Wotan working together in WWII. They made their way to Germany and were able to get the Spear of Destiny. They didn\u2019t want it to take control of superpowered beings, though, which is normally what it was used for. Instead, they wanted it as part of a summoning. Sorrow has always been about summoning the dark gods of the Subtle Realms to the Earth. These Lovecraftian beings don\u2019t want to come here because of the shopping or the wealth; no, they want to devour everything in their path. The end of the issue reveals that this is also the goal of the Injustice Society in the present day. Now obviously, there has to be more in it for Wotan at least if he\u2019s helping Sorrow \u2014 he\u2019s probably been promised some amazing power or something \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to see the rest of the Injustice Society go for it.\nLies? Deception?\nThe Injustice Society is a lot of things, but they aren\u2019t wholesale monsters. Some of them, like Gentleman Ghost, just want wealth. Others want revenge against the JSA for prior defeats. Them coming together for a plan to take on the JSA makes a lot of sense. However, the thing about it is this \u2014 they aren\u2019t the type to want to destroy the entire world. The worst thing they want to do to the entire world is take it over. Otherwise, the Injustice Society isn\u2019t a bunch of mad dogs. Summoning the gods of the Subtle Realms is like letting wolves into the henhouse.\nThere\u2019s really only one reason for any of this to be happening \u2014 Sorrow and Wotan fooled everyone. The two of them have been working together for decades, and it looks like their plans are finally coming to fruition. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens when the rest of the team learns the truth. Kobra is told at the end, and she doesn\u2019t exactly look too enthused by the whole situation.\nJSA\n#8 is on sale now.\nThe post\nThe Injustice Society\u2019s Big Plan Has Been Revealed and I\u2019m Not Sure It Makes Sense\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:JSA facing a battle with the Injustice Society|JSA's core members were pulled into Surtur\u2019s Realm|Flashback tale in WWII featuring JSA facing Johnny Sorrow and Wotan|Injustice Society\u2019s latest scheme is their most destructive|Injustice Society plans to summon dark gods to Earth|Sorrow and Wotan have been working together for decades;E:JSA battling the Injustice Society|Wildcat died fighting Wotan|JSA dealing with a traitor problem|Johnny Sorrow and Wotan face off in WWII|Injustice Society revealing their plans|Kobra learning the truth about Sorrow and Wotan\u2019s plan;D:Injustice Society has existed since the Golden Age comics|Spear of Destiny used for a summoning instead of controlling superpowered beings|Injustice Society members include Johnny Sorrow, Wotan, Solomon Grundy, Red Lantern II, Doctor Elemental, Gentleman Ghost, Kobra, Vanderlyle, and the Fog|Lovecraftian beings want to devour everything in their path|JSA #8 is on sale now;", "er_digest": "N:Johnny Sorrow|Doctor Fate|Solomon Grundy|Gentleman Ghost|The Wizard|Kobra|Vanderlyle|Doctor Elemental|The Fog|Injustice Society|Vandal Savage|Wildcat|JSA|Wotan;R:Germany;", "gist": "P:JSA facing a battle with the Injustice Society|JSA's core members were pulled into Surtur\u2019s Realm|Flashback tale in WWII featuring JSA facing Johnny Sorrow and Wotan|Injustice Society\u2019s latest scheme is their most destructive|Injustice Society plans to summon dark gods to Earth|Sorrow and Wotan have been working together for decades;E:JSA battling the Injustice Society|Wildcat died fighting Wotan|JSA dealing with a traitor problem|Johnny Sorrow and Wotan face off in WWII|Injustice Society revealing their plans|Kobra learning the truth about Sorrow and Wotan\u2019s plan;D:Injustice Society has existed since the Golden Age comics|Spear of Destiny used for a summoning instead of controlling superpowered beings|Injustice Society members include Johnny Sorrow, Wotan, Solomon Grundy, Red Lantern II, Doctor Elemental, Gentleman Ghost, Kobra, Vanderlyle, and the Fog|Lovecraftian beings want to devour everything in their path|JSA #8 is on sale now;N:Johnny Sorrow|Doctor Fate|Solomon Grundy|Gentleman Ghost|The Wizard|Kobra|Vanderlyle|Doctor Elemental|The Fog|Injustice Society|Vandal Savage|Wildcat|JSA|Wotan;R:Germany;", "entities": ["Johnny Sorrow", "Doctor Fate", "Solomon Grundy", "Gentleman Ghost", "The Wizard", "Kobra", "Vanderlyle", "Doctor Elemental", "The Fog", "Injustice Society", "Vandal Savage", "Wildcat", "JSA", "Wotan"], "regions": ["Germany"]}, {"_id": "https://awfulannouncing.com/mlb/cubs-nico-hoerner-ejected-explains.html", "content": "Sometimes, umpires don\u2019t have very good days.\nFor the crew responsible for the Detroit Tigers-Chicago Cubs series this past weekend, it wasn\u2019t a very good three-game series.

Once perceived as ideological allies \u2014 Musk backed Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential bid with nearly $300 million and held a brief advisory role in the White House \u2014 their relationship has dramatically unraveled, sparking political controversy, investor anxiety, and national protests.\nThe feud began with Musk\u2019s vocal criticism of Trump\u2019s massive federal initiative known as the \u201c\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\n,\u201d a sweeping piece of legislation focused on AI and defense innovation. Musk questioned both the program\u2019s\nfinancial transparency\nand the backgrounds of its key investors. His skepticism, voiced on X (formerly Twitter), was viewed as a direct challenge to Trump\u2019s policy agenda.\nREAD: DOGE goes after consulting firms under Trump\n(March 7, 2025)\nTrump, never one to shy away from confrontation, lashed out by accusing Musk of disloyalty, highlighting how much Musk\u2019s companies had benefited from government contracts under his presidency.\nThe situation escalated into personal attacks. Musk implied on social media that Trump may have had connections to Jeffrey Epstein, a\nclaim that provoked outrage\n. Trump retaliated by threatening to cut federal support for Tesla and SpaceX, and even hinted at investigating Musk\u2019s political activities. He publicly warned of \u201cserious consequences\u201d should Musk align with Democratic opposition.\nThis breakdown had immediate financial consequences. Particularly Tesla, which relies on regulatory credits and federal tax incentives. Tesla\u2019s stock saw a noticeable dip in early 2025, and\nMusk\u2019s personal net worth\napparently dropped by billions in a matter of weeks. SpaceX, also deeply intertwined with government contracts, faced uncertainty about future funding and regulatory scrutiny.\nIn Silicon Valley, reactions are mixed but largely muted. Some tech executives are privately relieved to see Musk\u2019s political influence wane, while others worry about the broader implications of the feud on innovation policy and regulation.\nThe Trump-Musk fallout in 2025 has reshaped America\u2019s political and business landscape. Once a partnership of convenience and ambition, it now stands as a cautionary tale about the volatile intersection of power, ego, and politics.\nAfter the fallout with Trump, Musk faces a pivotal moment in his career and public life. Known for his visionary leadership in technology and space exploration, Musk now finds himself navigating the complex intersection of politics and business with increased scrutiny. The rupture has highlighted the risks of intertwining billionaire influence with partisan politics, potentially impacting his companies like Tesla and SpaceX, which rely on government contracts and favorable policies.\nHowever, Musk\u2019s resilience and ability to innovate remain strong assets. His potential move toward creating a new political platform suggests a desire to reshape the political landscape on his own terms, distancing himself from traditional party lines. While challenges lie ahead\u2014both in managing public perception and maintaining regulatory support\u2014Musk\u2019s future will likely be defined by how effectively he balances his entrepreneurial ambitions with his evolving political identity.

Proper planning cuts costs by decreasing the need for generation and transmission investments overall, while allowing the grid to be operated more efficiently.\n\u201cThe affordability of electricity supply depends in no small part on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the associated transmission expansion,\u201d the report says.\nWell-planned, high-capacity transmission could save residential customers $6.3 billion to $10.4 billion across the country after taking the cost of new power lines into account. Across all customer classes, the savings are estimated at $16.8 billion to $27.7 billion.\nTransmission planners often underestimate benefits in their initial planning studies, and\nex post\nassessments of consumers savings are often 20 to 40% higher. Applying that to potential annual savings for residential customers brings the range up to $8.7 billion to $14.4 billion, the report says.\nMost of the estimated savings come from lower production costs, which means savings from lowering the cost of the power supply by accessing low-cost generation.\nInvesting in transmission as the report suggests would raise the transmission component of bills by 2% overall, which is a $19 increase annually. But that comes with a 3% cut in generation costs, which translates to $92 in savings annually for the average household.\nThe report based its estimates on annual savings in recent transmission planning efforts in several regions of the country, but that does not reflect the optimal buildout in doing well-planned, coordinated and cost-effective investments. Some regions are not engaged in that kind of planning at all.\n\u201cExtrapolating from a combined set of the recent portfolios planned by\nMISO\ndiscussed in this report, which are among the most robust examples of well-planned, high-voltage transmission, gives a better idea of the full savings consumers might see from more holistic, comprehensive transmission planning,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis analysis reveals that\nevery\nresidential household in the country could expect over $100 in net savings on their annual electric bill if this type of planning were the norm nationwide.\u201d\nBeyond the savings, transmission supports a reliable, resilient and competitive power system, which benefits national security because of the race to develop artificial intelligence and the high-demand data centers it requires, the report says. A lack of transmission can delay electricity for consumers, slowing economic growth and jeopardizing national goals.\nExpanding transmission also means more options to manage the uncertainties facing the power sector today, such as unpredictable load growth, volatile fuel prices, policy uncertainty, uncertain cost trajectories for costs of different types of generators and extreme weather.\n\u201c\nThe reality is that price spikes can be crippling for electricity customers, even if they appropriately reflect market design and supply-and-demand fundamentals,\u201d the report says. \u201cAs a commodity, electricity is different. It requires hedging and long-term planning that reflects the importance of the service to residential, industrial and commercial customers, as well as the relative degree of price inelasticity for American households. Well planned, high-voltage transmission investment is an essential piece of this puzzle.\u201d\nThe post\nACEG: Comprehensive Transmission Planning Saves Consumers Money\nappeared first on\nRTO Insider\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Comprehensive transmission planning saves consumers money|Expands transmission grid to keep power prices affordable|Improves system efficiency|Supports a reliable, resilient, and competitive power system|Addresses uncertainties in the power sector;E:Report released by Americans for a Clean Energy Grid on June 9|Grid Strategies prepared the report \"Large-Scale Transmission Deployment Saves Consumers Money\"|Transmission planners often underestimate benefits|Analysis extrapolates from MISO portfolios;D:$6.3 billion to $10.4 billion savings for residential customers|$16.8 billion to $27.7 billion savings across all customer classes|Potential annual savings for residential customers: $8.7 billion to $14.4 billion|2% increase in transmission component of bills ($19 annually)|3% cut in generation costs ($92 in savings annually for the average household)|Every residential household could expect over $100 in net savings annually;", "er_digest": "N:MISO|RTO Insider|Grid Strategies;", "gist": "P:Comprehensive transmission planning saves consumers money|Expands transmission grid to keep power prices affordable|Improves system efficiency|Supports a reliable, resilient, and competitive power system|Addresses uncertainties in the power sector;E:Report released by Americans for a Clean Energy Grid on June 9|Grid Strategies prepared the report \"Large-Scale Transmission Deployment Saves Consumers Money\"|Transmission planners often underestimate benefits|Analysis extrapolates from MISO portfolios;D:$6.3 billion to $10.4 billion savings for residential customers|$16.8 billion to $27.7 billion savings across all customer classes|Potential annual savings for residential customers: $8.7 billion to $14.4 billion|2% increase in transmission component of bills ($19 annually)|3% cut in generation costs ($92 in savings annually for the average household)|Every residential household could expect over $100 in net savings annually;N:MISO|RTO Insider|Grid Strategies;", "entities": ["MISO", "RTO Insider", "Grid Strategies"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://essential-japan.com/news/deadlock-cafe-now-open-in-tokyo-and-osaka-as-a-memorial-to-bl-author-aida-saki/", "content": "Last Updated on June 9, 2025\nEvent Overview\nManga Exhibition Stores will be hosting a new DEADLOCK themed collaboration cafe where you can enjoy a wide variety of menu items.\nLimited novelty goods such as bookmarks will be gifted to customers with the purchase of specific menu items.\nMenu\nA wide range of menu items will be available to order to eat in and takeout:\nMerchandise\nA wide variety of goods will be on sale.\nPurchase Bonus\nFor every 1,500 yen spent at the caf\u00e9, customers will receive 1 exclusive bookmark (selected at random from 3 types).\nMemorial Wall\nEach visitor to the cafe will receive a message card to leave thoughts about Aida Saki and her work.\nThere will be a message board at the venue to display the messages left by visitors which will be collected after the event and given to Aida Saki\u2019s family.\nReservations\nAdvanced reservations are recommended to visit the cafe, these can be mafe online via the official website and are priced at 550 yen per person.\nIt is possible to visit on the day without a reservation if tables are available.\nParticipating Stores\nManga Exhibition Ikebukuro\nMay 23rd (Fri) \u2013 June 1st (Sun) 2025\nOPEN 12:00 / CLOSE 19:00\nManga Exhibition Osaka\nJuly 18th (Fri) \u2013 August 3rd (Sun) 2025\nOPEN 12:00 / CLOSE 19:00\nEvent Details\ncalendar_month\nDATE\nMay 23 2025 -

This one comes to us from\nPrinceton, Missouri (Mercer County)\n,\u00a0home to a pair of Amish communities \u2013 one a good-sized one of over 600 people.\nSometimes people are surprised to see that some Amish families live in modular or mobile homes, but they shouldn\u2019t be. Not all Amish families live in the typical multi-bedroom two-story farmhouses with basement.\nA mobile or modular home can be a good solution for a young family, a single Amish person \u2013 or in this case \u2013 what appears to be a \u201cfull-sized\u201d Amish family (or something close to it).\nI base that assumption on the fact that the home has\nfive bedrooms\n, and in one photo we even see a collection of five horse-drawn vehicles parked in a shelter \u2013 so it\u2019s not a starter home \ud83d\ude42\nThe description via\nZillow\n:\nThis home on 5 acres is the perfect mini farm. Also on the acreage is a building that housed a variety store and discount grocery that only closed a few months ago.\nThe home and acreage could be split off to suit a new owners needs. This home is a converted modular home being lived in by the Amish so wiring and electricity will need to be installed by a new owner.\nThe home is a 5 bedroom home with one bath. An addition was added that is used as a mud room and has the propane hot water heater, a sink to wash up with before you enter the home, and a spicket that can be used to water outside animals or a garden.\nAs you enter the home through the mudroom, you enter an open living space that includes the kitchen, dining room, and living room.\nAdditional buildings on the property include a chicken coop, small storage shed, barn where they park buggies and have horses. There is a small pond on the property. The vacant building could be used for ag purposes, remodeled into a 2nd home, or you could open your own business.\nIt is 3600 sq feet and has an additional building that is a steel building that is 560 sq feet. This unique property will make someone an excellent home.\nYou can see this home has many of the\nclassic notes\nof a typical Amish home \u2013 just in a modular home shell. Like the kitchen here.\nWood stove, wall calendar, curtains, hooks for hats and coats, church-style bench. The only thing that stands out a bit is the table covering.\nThe cozy\nliving room\n. Upholstered furniture \u2013 recliners and sofas \u2013 so this is not the most conservative group. Cozy.\nIn another corner of the home, we see classic Amish furniture, a sewing machine, bird wall clock, and the thermometer-barometer-hygrometer common to Amish homes.\nAnd back around to the kitchen. Nice simple cabinetry. It\u2019s a bit unusual because it doesn\u2019t have the roomy, spacious feel of a typical Amish home, but all the other Amish notes are there \u2013 including the valances in the windows (hat tip to Stacy and Teresa \ud83d\ude42 ).\nBedrooms\nSo the\nbedrooms\nare a bit on the cramped (or \u201ccozy\u201d) side, but that reflects the elongated narrow design of the modular home. Perhaps one reason this family is selling is to get into some more spacious digs.\nA young man\u2019s room with hunting or target practice bows.\nA young lady\u2019s room. Greeting cards displayed on a string on the wall.\nNice traditional quilt here.\nAnd one more.\nThe one bathroom, with Dewalt battery light for illumination.\nAnd the mudroom mentioned in the description.\nAlso, here\u2019s a look at the store building that comes with the home. I would imagine this may be where this family holds church service when it\u2019s their turn \u2013 or possibly in one of the other buildings (though I\u2019m not seeing one that looks like it\u2019d be large enough).\nSo what\u2019s the price on this property?\nIt\u2019s currently on the market for\n$207,000\n, represented by Donald Wilburn of Century 21 Team Elite.\nGet the Amish in your inbox\nJoin 15,000 email subscribers.

In a series of interviews with German media last week, Tiesler said that to address this shortfall, the BBK plans to convert underground garages, metro tunnels, and public basements into shelters capable of accommodating one million people, complete with food, toilets and sleeping areas.\n\u201cNew bunkers with the highest protection standards cost a lot of money and take time.

Other plans include doubling the number of warning sirens nationwide, upgrading emergency apps to include missile strike instructions, and possibly introducing a national civil service requirement.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced last month that he intends to make the Bundeswehr the\u00a0\u201cstrongest army\u201d\u00a0on the continent.

Russian officials have also condemned Western Europe\u2019s militarization drive, expressing concern that, rather than supporting US-led peace initiatives for the Ukraine conflict, the EU and UK are instead gearing up for war with Russia.\nAccording to a recent survey, Germany has now replaced the US as the country Russians view as\nmost unfriendly\n.

He warned that the country is\u00a0\u201csliding down the same slippery slope it already followed a couple of times in the last century \u2013 toward its own collapse.\u201d", "ped_digest": "P:Germany is accelerating civil defense infrastructure expansion and modernization|Potential direct confrontation with Russia is a concern|Underground garages, metro tunnels, and public basements will be converted into shelters|Citizens are encouraged to reinforce windows and stock essentials|Germany could be a target for selective strikes|Hospitals are being assessed for mass casualty treatment|Civil protection must not be neglected|Russia dismisses attack claims as \"utter nonsense\"|Germany has replaced the US as the country Russians view as most unfriendly.E:Germany plans to convert existing structures into shelters|German Chancellor announced plans to strengthen the Bundeswehr|Defense Minister seeks a drastic increase in military budget|Germany is doubling the number of warning sirens|Emergency apps will be upgraded with missile strike instructions|Russia condemns Western Europe's militarization drive.D:580 operational shelters currently exist|Shelters currently accommodate about 480,000 people (less than 1% of the population)|Target is to accommodate one million people|Military budget aims to reach \u20ac90 billion ($102 billion) by 2028|\u20ac30 billion is called for over the next decade|At least \u20ac10 billion needed by 2029|Up to 1,000 additional patients per day in a wartime setting.Berlin|Russia|Ukraine|Western Europe|EU|UK|ContinentFederal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK)|Suddeutsche Zeitung|Zeit|Friedrich Merz|Bundeswehr|Boris Pistorius|Moscow|Sergey Lavrov|Kiev;", "er_digest": "N:Boris Pistorius|Suddeutsche Zeitung|Friedrich Merz|Ralph Tiesler|Sergey Lavrov;R:Germany|UK|Russia|Ukraine|Kiev|Berlin|Moscow;", "gist": "P:Germany is accelerating civil defense infrastructure expansion and modernization|Potential direct confrontation with Russia is a concern|Underground garages, metro tunnels, and public basements will be converted into shelters|Citizens are encouraged to reinforce windows and stock essentials|Germany could be a target for selective strikes|Hospitals are being assessed for mass casualty treatment|Civil protection must not be neglected|Russia dismisses attack claims as \"utter nonsense\"|Germany has replaced the US as the country Russians view as most unfriendly.E:Germany plans to convert existing structures into shelters|German Chancellor announced plans to strengthen the Bundeswehr|Defense Minister seeks a drastic increase in military budget|Germany is doubling the number of warning sirens|Emergency apps will be upgraded with missile strike instructions|Russia condemns Western Europe's militarization drive.D:580 operational shelters currently exist|Shelters currently accommodate about 480,000 people (less than 1% of the population)|Target is to accommodate one million people|Military budget aims to reach \u20ac90 billion ($102 billion) by 2028|\u20ac30 billion is called for over the next decade|At least \u20ac10 billion needed by 2029|Up to 1,000 additional patients per day in a wartime setting.Berlin|Russia|Ukraine|Western Europe|EU|UK|ContinentFederal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK)|Suddeutsche Zeitung|Zeit|Friedrich Merz|Bundeswehr|Boris Pistorius|Moscow|Sergey Lavrov|Kiev;N:Boris Pistorius|Suddeutsche Zeitung|Friedrich Merz|Ralph Tiesler|Sergey Lavrov;R:Germany|UK|Russia|Ukraine|Kiev|Berlin|Moscow;", "entities": ["Boris Pistorius", "Suddeutsche Zeitung", "Friedrich Merz", "Ralph Tiesler", "Sergey Lavrov"], "regions": ["Germany", "UK", "Russia", "Ukraine", "Kiev", "Berlin", "Moscow"]}, {"_id": "https://fictionhorizon.com/best-movies-about-orphans/", "content": "Skip to content\nStore\nNewsletter\n15 Best Movies About Orphans & Why You Should Watch Them\nBy\nTamara\nPublished on\nJune 9, 2025\nJune 9, 2025\n0 Comments\nOur\nEditorial Policy\n.\nShare:\nMany movies have dealt with the topic of orphans and their struggle to find their place in the world.

From the moment Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson\u2019s comic book series debuted, it challenged everything readers thought they knew about capes and cowls. So when Prime Video brought the world of\nThe Boys\nto TV in 2019, fans naturally wondered how much of the comic\u2019s shock factor would survive the leap to streaming. As it turns out, quite a bit.\nThough it\u2019s inevitable that the\nThe Boys\nTV adaptation had to its\nfair share of changes\n, there are moments that have stayed faithful to their comic book counterparts. From explosive character intros to iconic (and frankly, gross) moments that take a\nwhizz all over the boundaries of taste\n, here are 10 things that\nThe Boys\nTV show kept from the comics.\n1) Robin Is Killed by A-Train\nRight out of the gate,\nThe Boys\npulls no punches. Few character introductions are as instantly devastating as Hughie\u2019s. In both the comics and the series, Hughie Campbell\u2019s life is forever altered when his girlfriend, Robin, is killed by A-Train literally running through her so fast her body bursts, leaving Hughie holding her detached arms.\nIn the comics, Robin\u2019s death is shown through a splash page filled with gore. The show captures that same horror beat-for-beat, with the burst of blood and viscera splattering across one frame before we see Hughie covered in his love\u2019s remnants. In both mediums, the moment is sudden, visceral, and deeply personal, setting the tone for the world Hughie\u2019s about to enter.\nWhat makes this adaptation particularly effective is how it forces the audience to see superheroes from Hughie\u2019s eyes: as reckless, uncaring weapons who face no consequences. It\u2019s the ultimate perversion of the superhero fantasy.\n2\n)\nStarlight\u2019s Horrific Initiation to the Seven\nWhen Annie January joins the Seven as Starlight, it\u2019s supposed to be the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for her. But the saying \u201cnever meet your heroes\u201d has never been more apt when she quickly discovers the truth of the Vought Supes.\nIn the comics, Starlight is gang-assaulted by three male members of the team during her very first day. It\u2019s a deeply traumatic moment that sets the tone for her arc going forward. In the Prime Video TV series, the assault still plays out, however Starlight\u2019s assault is only perpetrated by The Deep, rather than multiple supes. While the show changes the dynamics, the core violation and abuse of power remain the same.\nKripke\u2019s approach humanizes Annie by showing her navigating trauma, defiance, and resilience in the face of systemic exploitation. While less explicit than the comics, the emotional and thematic weight is just as strong, illustrating how corruption festers even in the most celebrated institutions.\n3\n)\nHomelander\u2019s Sadistic Tendencies\nFew characters in\nThe Boys\nare as disturbingly consistent between page and screen as Homelander. In both the comics and the Prime Video adaptation, Homelander is a sociopathic narcissist hiding behind the pristine image of America\u2019s greatest superhero. From threatening passengers on a crashing plane to committing horrific acts under the guise of public heroism, Antony Starr\u2019s portrayal delivers a beat-for-beat echo of the comic\u2019s most depraved moments.\nKey moments around his grotesque abuse of power, chilling indifference to civilian casualties, and manipulative relationship with Madelyn Stillwell (or in the comics, a Vought executive named James Stillwell) remain intact. In some ways the show adds more of a chilling depth bringing in the Stillwell Oedipal complex milk fetishes and parental abandonment issues. These merely further the messed-up mind of Homelander, rather than detract from the comic\u2019s portrayal of the authoritarian sociopathy in spandex.\n4\n)\nHerogasm\nFans of the comics were as excited as Frenchie to learn that the annual supes orgy was going to make an appearance on screen. That\u2019s right, the debauched \u201csex-con\u201d,\nHerogasm,\nstarted out in the comics as one of the most notorious, boundary-pushing arcs Garth Ennis ever penned.\nIn the comics, the sex-fueled getaway is disguised as an intergalactic mission to battle an alien threat, a parody of larger comic book event storylines. What follows is a week of depravity among the world\u2019s most powerful \u201cheroes.\u201d The show\u2019s recreation in Season 3 doesn\u2019t disappoint, dedicating an entire episode to capturing the setting\u2019s excesses.\nWhile the TV version tones down some of the comic\u2019s most extreme moments \u2014 for legal, logistical, and taste reasons \u2014 the spirit and structure remain intact. It\u2019s one of the rare superhero adaptations willing to confront the lurid, hedonistic potential of superpowered celebrity with such gleeful audacity. Notably, both versions use\nHerogasm\nnot just for shock, but as a device to back the veil of the Seven\u2019s hypocrisy and human frailty.\n5\n)\nThe Plane Disaster\nOne of the bleakest moments in\nThe Boys\ncomes early in both the TV and comic book versions when a mission to stop a hijacked plane turns tragic. Though the wider reason for the hijacking is not the same in the TV show (the comic version\u2019s plot is actually connected to 9/11), the comic still has the Seven\u2019s bungled rescue which ends with them abandoning the plane \u2014 and its passengers \u2014 to face a fiery end.\nThe TV series replicates this with chilling precision in Season 1\u2019s \u201cThe Self-Preservation Society.\u201d Homelander and Queen Maeve realize their incompetence, and Homelander\u2019s ruthless pragmatism makes saving the passengers impossible. The cold decision to let everyone die, rather than risk Homelander\u2019s public image, underscores the moral rot at the heart of superhero celebrity.\nMaeve\u2019s visible guilt adds an emotional dimension largely absent from the comics. The scene\u2019s sheer horror also functions as a turning point for Maeve, planting the seeds for her eventual defiance. It\u2019s a textbook example of how the show deepens the comics\u2019 nihilistic satire with added humanity.\n6\n)\nButcher\u2019s Brutality\nIn both mediums, Billy Butcher is driven by a singular, violent desire for vengeance against Homelander and Vought International. His vendetta stems from the assault of his wife, Becca, and her subsequent death during childbirth. Unlike the show, she does indeed pass away, and Urban\u2019s reaction is absolutely terrifying, and the reason why Ryan only exists in the Prime Video universe.\nDespite that one brutal difference, the comics and TV series align closely on Butcher\u2019s overall actions. His recruitment of Hughie, his merciless tactics, and his ends-justify-the-means leadership are pretty much parallels. In both versions, Butcher embodies the dangers of vengeance unchecked, and how it can corrode even those fighting for ostensibly noble causes. However, the show also explores Butcher\u2019s vulnerabilities in greater detail, particularly through his complex relationships with the likes of Becca and Hughie.\n7\n)\nCompound V\nIn both\nThe Boys\ncomics and Prime Video series, Compound V is the game-changing serum that flips the superhero world upside down. It\u2019s the not-so-secret sauce that turns regular people into super-powered icons. And in both Ips, The Boys use it too. In the comics, The Boy are using the compound from the get-go. It\u2019s a team agreement that they need to have injections of Compound V too level the playing field when facing their suped-up adversaries and using the enemy\u2019s own weapons to take them down.\nThough the TV show chose to take its time before getting to that point, it has finally caught up with the comic books. The decision to maintain Compound V\u2019s role as a world-shaping conspiracy helped keep the adaptation rooted in the comic\u2019s biting critique of corporate control and manufactured celebrity. Even with some changes\u2014like the introduction of Temp V\u2014the message remains intact: in both the comic and the show, superpowers come at a cost, and nobody gets them for free.\n8\n)\nStormfront\u2019s Political Beliefs\nStormfront is easily one of the most twisted and ideologically dangerous characters in both\nThe Boys\ncomics and the Prime Video adaptation. Despite some surface-level changes like changing the character from from male in the comics to female in the series, the essence of Stormfront\u2019s character remains disturbingly consistent. The supe is a Nazi super-soldier who uses power and charisma to propagate fascist ideology under the mask of American superheroism.\nIn the comics, Stormfront is the first successful superhuman, created by Nazi scientists during World War II and later brought to America to serve as both propaganda and enforcer. His violent tendencies, racist views, and obsession with a superhuman master race are central to his identity. Similarly, in the TV show, Stormfront (formerly Klara Risinger) is revealed to be the wife of Vought founder Frederick Vought and a direct product of Nazi experimentation. Her polished public persona hides a deep-seated belief in racial superiority and a calculated effort to reignite those ideologies in modern society.\n9\n)\nQueen Maeve\u2019s Spiral\nIn both the\nThe Boys\ncomics and Prime Video series, Queen Maeve stands out as one of the few Supes with an actual conscience. But having a moral compass in a world run by Vought comes with a price.When audiences first meet Maeve in the show, she\u2019s already jaded, emotionally distant, and drinking heavily. As the episodes unfold, we see it\u2019s to cope with the years of covering up the Seven\u2019s atrocities.\nThis portrayal lines up closely with her comic book version. Maeve is rarely shown without a drink in her hand in the comics. Her constant intoxication shows just how broken she really is beneath the regal exterior. Much like the Prime Video adaptation, comic book Maeve is a powerful woman who once believed in heroism but has been crushed and disillusioned by the brutal reality of Vought\u2019s system.\n10.\n)\nVought\u2019s Product & PR Factory\nIn both\nThe Boys\ncomic series and the Prime Video adaptation the depiction of Vought is remarkably consistent. In the comics, the company operates largely behind the scenes, manipulating events to ensure its continued supremacy. Likewise, the TV series portrays Vought as a master of spin, staging rescues, covering up atrocities, and crafting heroic personas for deeply flawed individuals, all to preserve their corporate image and keep the shareholders happy.\nPerhaps the most striking continuity between the two versions is the portrayal of superheroes as manufactured products. Vought controls everything from the supes\u2019 origin stories and media appearances to movies, merchandising deals and politically motivated team-ups. Whether it\u2019s through orchestrated PR stunts or brutal cover-ups, both the comic and show make clear that public perception is Vought\u2019s true priority, and the supes are just messed up puppets.\nThe post\n10 Things The Boys TV Show Takes Straight From the Comics\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Brutality|Satire|Superhero Tropes|Shock Factor|Faithful Adaptation|Trauma|Abuse of Power|Hypocrisy|Vengeance|Corporate Control;E:Comic Debut|TV Adaptation|Character Intros|Gang-Assault|Plane Disaster|Herogasm|Superpower Origin|Political Manipulation|Public Perception|PR Stunts;D:2019|10 Things|Splash Page|Gore|Viscera|Alien Threat|Superhuman Master Race|Nazi Experimentation|Shareholders|Compound V;", "er_digest": "N:Darick Robertson|Annie January|Madelyn Stillwell|Becca|Klara Risinger|Garth Ennis|Billy Butcher|Frederick Vought|Hughie Campbell|Ryan|Antony Starr|Robin;", "gist": "P:Brutality|Satire|Superhero Tropes|Shock Factor|Faithful Adaptation|Trauma|Abuse of Power|Hypocrisy|Vengeance|Corporate Control;E:Comic Debut|TV Adaptation|Character Intros|Gang-Assault|Plane Disaster|Herogasm|Superpower Origin|Political Manipulation|Public Perception|PR Stunts;D:2019|10 Things|Splash Page|Gore|Viscera|Alien Threat|Superhuman Master Race|Nazi Experimentation|Shareholders|Compound V;N:Darick Robertson|Annie January|Madelyn Stillwell|Becca|Klara Risinger|Garth Ennis|Billy Butcher|Frederick Vought|Hughie Campbell|Ryan|Antony Starr|Robin;", "entities": ["Darick Robertson", "Annie January", "Madelyn Stillwell", "Becca", "Klara Risinger", "Garth Ennis", "Billy Butcher", "Frederick Vought", "Hughie Campbell", "Ryan", "Antony Starr", "Robin"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://fictionhorizon.com/best-movies-about-mistresses/", "content": "Skip to content\nStore\nNewsletter\n10 Best Movies About Mistresses & Why You Should Watch Them\nBy\nTamara\nPublished on\nJune 9, 2025\nJune 9, 2025\n0 Comments\nOur\nEditorial Policy\n.\nShare:\nRelationships, marriages, and\nvarious love affairs\nare always interesting topics in movies.

Poe\nPublished on\nJune 10, 2025\nJune 10, 2025\n0 Comments\nOur\nEditorial Policy\n.\nShare:\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nis a franchise that has become quite popular and is often quoted as one of the most entertaining anime series of the 21st century. It\u2019s quirky, it\u2019s epic, it\u2019s mildly pervy, and has a great plot, which is what a lot of people would expect from an anime show.\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nhas a plethora of interesting characters on its roster and we have decided to present one group from the series in this article.\nNamely, this list will focus on the Seven Deadly Sins as a group, as we will bring you each character along with their official power levels. The characters will be listed from weakest (lowest power level) to strongest (highest power level), as we will also bring you some additional info about each of them.\n7. Gowther\nEstimated Total Power Level: 35,400\nDuring his fight against the Dawn Roar in Ordan\u2019s Village, Gowther demonstrates the ability to catch Weinheidt\u2019s charged arrow with his bare hands and easily slice off the armored creature\u2019s head with his hand as well. He possesses enchanted armor that is capable of suppressing and preventing some powers from becoming uncontrollable and possibly amplifying his strength. Also, he is absolutely resilient. After Slader breaks his neck, he stands up and fixes his neck back to normal as if nothing happened.\nRELATED:\nThe same thing happened when Hendrickson decapitated him, Gowther\u2019s body was able to move on its own, and he put his head back on as if nothing had happened to him. Not much is known about Gowther\u2019s true strength. This is because Gowther often uses his Invasion to trap people in an illusion instead of fighting them directly. However, despite not fighting on his strength, Gowther is still known as the most dangerous of the Seven Deadly Sins due to his mind-breaking ability, as evidenced in his fight against Dreyfus. Gowther can easily parry attacks with his bare hand, as demonstrated by parrying Weinheidt\u2019s arrow, and can quickly dodge.\n6. Diane (Giant Size)\nEstimated Total Power Level: 55,000\nDiane is demonstrated to be extraordinarily resilient. According to Matrona, who oversaw Diane\u2019s training, she has the potential to emerge as the Giant Clan\u2019s top warrior. She could stop a swarm of insects that were about to destroy the city by drilling into the dirt and using it as a barrier. She has also demonstrated incredible strength by withstanding a Gilthunder bolt and even managing to escape from it. She demonstrates her extraordinary physical prowess and speed during the fight festival\u2019s preliminary round by swiftly and easily defeating more than ten men as Matrona (average human size).\nLater in the story, after having passed Drole\u2019s test and mastered her sacred dance, Diane increases her powers and abilities even more, now being able to use Drole\u2019s dance to deepen her connection to the Earth. Melascula compared the force of her blows to Drole\u2019s, although she is not as powerful as most other Seven Deadly Sins members.\n5.\nMerlin (True Power)\nEstimated Total Power Level: 220,000\nMerlin is a particularly strong member of the Seven Deadly Sins. She was regarded as Britannia\u2019s top magician. When confronted, she was able to outclass Vivian, her former student and Liones\u2019 top mage, as well as some of the most powerful holy knights Liones had to offer. Grayroad, who is one of the Ten Commandments, was defeated by her after she managed to escape from Galand\u2019s petrification. She praises Chandler and Cusack, the \u201cgenie kid\u201d who betrayed the Demon King, also the highest deity, as she beats the two most powerful demons while taking part in the Battle of Camelot. The leader of the Four Archangels, Ludociel, pledges that he will never oppose Merlin.\n4.\nKing (Full Grown Wings)\nEstimated Total Power Level: 416,000\nAs a member of the Seven Deadly Sins and the number and most powerful Fairy King in history, King is extremely powerful. He is strong enough to singlehandedly overpower a great sacred knight. As a fairy, King displayed a number of skills unique to his species. Such as the ability to hover or fly, the ability to change looks and clothes at will, and high speed similar to both Ban and Meliodas.\nRELATED:\nAll 4 Seasons of \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 in Order (Including OVAs, Specials, Movies & Spinoff)\nHe had \u201can unbelievable level\u201d of strength, Meliodas and Ban noted after releasing his true power. This was later reinforced when he won his fight against Helbram, a combatant of the Holy Grand Knight rank, while also tending to the wounded nearby. Despite the wounds he received in his fight with Helbram, he next quickly defeated Dreyfus, one of the Knights of the Great Holy Lion.\n3.\nBan (with Sacred Treasure Release & after Purgatory)\nEstimated Total Power Level: 675,000\nBan is a particularly strong member of the Seven Deadly Sins. He is faster and stronger than any regular human being, with his strength and snatch ability, which he uses to rip the organs of opponents, ideally their hearts, with the help of his speed, being his specialties. His immortality, though, is what truly amazes me. No matter how serious the injuries, Ban\u2019s wounds all heal almost rapidly thanks to sipping from the Fountain of Youth.\nIn addition, he never ages, doesn\u2019t require food or water and is impervious to all poisons. Because of the fact that he is actually immortal, he is able to fight far more brutally than most people are willing to. Ban\u2019s blood is able to totally recreate the Fairy King Forest and heal the wounds of others because it has been merged with the Fountain of Youth.\nBan, however, lost this skill\nwhen he revived Elaine using the Fountain of Youth.\n2. Escanor\n(The One Ultimate)\nEstimated Total Power Level: 798,000\nEscanor has been referred to be\nthe strongest of the Seven Deadly Sins\nbecause, when the sun rose, he quickly vanquished both Melascula and Galand, two powerful members of the Ten Commandments, while Ban and Jericho were powerless in the face of the two formidable Commandments. By both allies and adversaries alike, Escanor\u2019s strength is regarded as monstrous. One of the\nTen Commandments\nmost powerful members, Estarossa, was paralyzed by the terror of Escanor\u2019s strength and refused to accept that a being so strong could be human.\n1. Meliodas\n(True Magic Form)\nEstimated Total Power Level: 1,000,000\nMeliodas was known for his strength and skill in combat. When Meliodas was part of the Demon Clan, the enemies of the Demon Clan as well as other demons, regarded him be the most powerful demon after the Demon King, and were very scared of him. He was the legendary head of the Seven Deadly Sins, and while he was a member of the Demon Clan, he previously held the positions of leader of the Ten Commandments and the sole rightful heir to the Demon King\u2019s throne.\nRELATED:\nMeliodas and Elizabeth: A Story About Love, a Curse & a Child\nSo strong that the demon Gowther claimed that his defection alone tipped the scales of power in favor of the goddess clan and allowed it to initiate the holy war, In a last-ditch effort to gain the upper hand over the goddess clan in Estarossa, Gowther coerces Mael, the strongest member of the goddess clan, into converting from the demon clan.\nReviews\nInterviews\nWrite for Us\nEditorial Policy\nDMCA & Removal Policy\nAffiliate Disclosure\nPress Kit\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms\nOwnership\nSitemap\nDepositphotos", "ped_digest": "P:Seven Deadly Sins power levels ranked|Anime series popularity|Quirky and epic plot|Interesting characters|Anime show|E:Ranking of Seven Deadly Sins|Fight against Dawn Roar|Battle of Camelot|Fight festival|Holy War|D:35,400 (Gowther)|55,000 (Diane)|220,000 (Merlin)|416,000 (King)|675,000 (Ban)|798,000 (Escanor)|1,000,000 (Meliodas)|Weinheidt's arrow|Gilthunder bolt|Drole\u2019s test|;", "er_digest": "N:Weinheidt|Diane|Hendrickson|Gowther|Arthur S.

It\u2019s not always easy to keep track of what\u2019s hot with the fans, but these reveals often show at least a glimpse of prominent series to follow.

The Shonen Jump+ manga is one of the best manga going right now, and with the\nBerserk\n-style art and the very dark plot line, the manga has gradually been receiving more eyes on it. Tohru Kuramori\u2019s new hit has only 4 volumes, but it seems the future for the series is guaranteed, and it will be going for quite some time, and hopefully maintain its current amazing quality or get better.\n3)\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Purple Smoke Distortion\nAnnouncement: What happened to Pannacotta Fugo after the events of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Part 5\u2013Golden Wind?

Volume 5 was last released on March 1st, 2022, and it has been radio silent since then.

It is truly unfortunate that these three were axed, as they had a good following, especially\nTwo on Ice\n, but this should remedy the fact that the stories are concluded.\nThe post\n7 Most Exciting Viz Media Spring 2025 Manga Announcements\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Viz Media announced new manga licenses|Spring 2025 announcements|Fastest manga to get a print|English print for Shonen Jump+ manga|First Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure novel translated|Dragon Quest manga returns|Final Junji Ito Masterpiece Collection|Magical Girl Dandelion licensed|Cancelled Shonen Jump manga available digitally;E:Viz Media held an event|Announcement of new licenses and manga|Release of Ichi The Witch|Release of Centuria|Release of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Purple Smoke Distortion|Return of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai|Release of Statues: Junji Ito Story Collection|Release of Magical Girl Dandelion|Green Green Greens released digitally|Shadow Eliminators released digitally|Two On Ice released digitally;D:Ichi The Witch Vol. 1 releases Spring 2026|Centuria Vol. 1 releases Spring 2026|JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Purple Smoke Distortion releases Spring 2026|Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai returns Spring 2026|Statues: Junji Ito Story Collection releases|Magical Girl Dandelion Vol. 1 releases Spring 2026|Green Green Greens releases Spring 2026|Shadow Eliminators releases Spring 2026|Two On Ice releases Spring 2026|Volume 5 of Dragon Quest released March 1st, 2022|France|Kingdom|Jujutsu Kaisen|My Hero Academia|Ichi The Witch|Osamu Nishi|Shiro Usazaki|Desscaras|Shonen Jump|Centuria|Tohru Kuramori|Berserk|JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure|Kohei Kadono|Hirohiko Araki|JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Shining Diamond\u2019s Demonic Heartbreak|Dragon Quest|Riku Sanjo|Koji Inada|Yuji Horii|Junji Ito|Kaeru Mizuho|Magical Girl Dandelion|Green Green Greens|Kento Terasaka|Shadow Eliminators|Kento Amemiya|Two On Ice|Elck Itsumo|ComicBook.com;", "er_digest": "N:Osamu Nishi|Elck Itsumo|Viz Media|Shiro Usazaki;R:France;", "gist": "P:Viz Media announced new manga licenses|Spring 2025 announcements|Fastest manga to get a print|English print for Shonen Jump+ manga|First Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure novel translated|Dragon Quest manga returns|Final Junji Ito Masterpiece Collection|Magical Girl Dandelion licensed|Cancelled Shonen Jump manga available digitally;E:Viz Media held an event|Announcement of new licenses and manga|Release of Ichi The Witch|Release of Centuria|Release of JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Purple Smoke Distortion|Return of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai|Release of Statues: Junji Ito Story Collection|Release of Magical Girl Dandelion|Green Green Greens released digitally|Shadow Eliminators released digitally|Two On Ice released digitally;D:Ichi The Witch Vol. 1 releases Spring 2026|Centuria Vol. 1 releases Spring 2026|JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Purple Smoke Distortion releases Spring 2026|Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai returns Spring 2026|Statues: Junji Ito Story Collection releases|Magical Girl Dandelion Vol. 1 releases Spring 2026|Green Green Greens releases Spring 2026|Shadow Eliminators releases Spring 2026|Two On Ice releases Spring 2026|Volume 5 of Dragon Quest released March 1st, 2022|France|Kingdom|Jujutsu Kaisen|My Hero Academia|Ichi The Witch|Osamu Nishi|Shiro Usazaki|Desscaras|Shonen Jump|Centuria|Tohru Kuramori|Berserk|JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure|Kohei Kadono|Hirohiko Araki|JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Shining Diamond\u2019s Demonic Heartbreak|Dragon Quest|Riku Sanjo|Koji Inada|Yuji Horii|Junji Ito|Kaeru Mizuho|Magical Girl Dandelion|Green Green Greens|Kento Terasaka|Shadow Eliminators|Kento Amemiya|Two On Ice|Elck Itsumo|ComicBook.com;N:Osamu Nishi|Elck Itsumo|Viz Media|Shiro Usazaki;R:France;", "entities": ["Osamu Nishi", "Elck Itsumo", "Viz Media", "Shiro Usazaki"], "regions": ["France"]}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/anime/news/one-punch-man-season-1-director-madhouse-anime-movie/", "content": "From the creators and studio behind the\nincredibly gorgeous and breathtaking original anime\nSonny Boy\nand the impossibly good first season of\nOne-Punch Man\ncomes a new feature film that was just announced, and it will be coming soon. From the plot description, poster, key staff, and the creator\u2019s words that accompanied the announcement, this movie is going to be a must-see, as it has all the ingredients to become something special and yet another masterpiece in Shingo Natsume\u2019s portfolio. It\u2019s unsurprising, as when you peek under the hood to see his library of anime series and film hits, one can reasonably expect something great virtually every time, especially with acclaimed anime studio Madhouse at his side.\nAs confirmed by the official X (formerly Twitter) account of Madhouse studio, in a new viral post, a feature-length anime movie from Shingo Natsume, the director of\nSonny Boy\n. The acclaimed anime director known for his transcendent isekai hit, as well as\nOne-Punch Man\nSeason 1,\nSpace Dandy,\nTatami Time Machine Blues\n, and more, will both direct and write the script of the movie, which is titled\nghost\n. A poster of a young girl holding a glass sword, and in front of a starry background was released, as well as two stills from the movie. Everything about this movie sounds amazing thus far, and it goes without saying that the visuals and production value will be off the charts yet again.\nRELATED:\nFrieren\nStudio Madhouse Unveils New Anime Project\u2019s First Look Coming in 2026\nMadhouse/Shingo Natsume\nEach person carries a hidden \u201cghost\u201d in their heart\u2014an authentic yet unspoken emotion that remains inside. In this tale, the girl Nike stands up against the absurdities of the world to safeguard the \u201cstarry sky,\u201d representing hope and beauty. Her tranquil defiance not only showcases her profound loneliness but also her inner resilience. As she builds connections with others, the narrative softly unveils the delicate feelings she holds, intertwining her personal battle with a quiet, heroic resolve.\nShingo Natsume will serve as both the director and the scriptwriter and together with Tomohiro Suzuki, will be the original creators of the film. Natsume Ono, creator of the\nACCA 13-Ku Kansatsu-Ka P.S.\nmanga, is the original character designer, with Norifumi Gai doing the character designs for the film. These are the only known members of the core staff, and there\u2019s no information yet on the voice actors, but from the limited information so far, the movie is in more than capable hands that will produce a great result.\nShingo Natsume revealed that for\nghost\n, he wants to create a totally fictional story that is rooted in current-day issues and has a realistic approach to it. The plot indicates it is going to be a more personal and emotional story that tackles\nthemes of loneliness and existentialism\n, using surreal visuals and animation techniques. Sonny Boy showed just how brilliant his storytelling and direction were, and the things that made that series amazing will hopefully be present in this upcoming film.\nThe post\nOne-Punch Man Season 1 Director Teams Up Again With Madhouse for First Original Movie\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:New anime movie announced|Directed and written by Shingo Natsume|Features Nike as the protagonist|Explores themes of loneliness and existentialism|Visually stunning production expected;E:Announcement of the movie \"ghost\"|Release of poster and stills|Shingo Natsume confirmed as director and writer|Collaboration with Madhouse studio;D:Movie title: ghost|Release year: 2026|Nike's role: Safeguarding the \"starry sky\"|Themes: Loneliness, existentialism;", "er_digest": "N:Shingo Natsume|Sonny Boy|Nike|Tatami Time Machine Blues|ComicBook.com|One-Punch Man|Natsume Ono|Madhouse|Norifumi Gai|Space Dandy;", "gist": "P:New anime movie announced|Directed and written by Shingo Natsume|Features Nike as the protagonist|Explores themes of loneliness and existentialism|Visually stunning production expected;E:Announcement of the movie \"ghost\"|Release of poster and stills|Shingo Natsume confirmed as director and writer|Collaboration with Madhouse studio;D:Movie title: ghost|Release year: 2026|Nike's role: Safeguarding the \"starry sky\"|Themes: Loneliness, existentialism;N:Shingo Natsume|Sonny Boy|Nike|Tatami Time Machine Blues|ComicBook.com|One-Punch Man|Natsume Ono|Madhouse|Norifumi Gai|Space Dandy;", "entities": ["Shingo Natsume", "Sonny Boy", "Nike", "Tatami Time Machine Blues", "ComicBook.com", "One-Punch Man", "Natsume Ono", "Madhouse", "Norifumi Gai", "Space Dandy"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/netflix-best-comedy-shows-new-tv-tires-season-2/", "content": "Netflix\nAfter a year away, the best new comedy series on Netflix has returned for its sophomore season, and fans have spent the last few days realizing that the new episodes are raising the bar even higher. The show in question is\nTires\n, the workplace comedy series from Shane Gillis, Steve Gerben, and McKeever. Gerben and Gillis star in the series as employees of an auto repair chain just trying to keep things afloat on a day-to-day basis, and their chemistry has quickly formed one of the funniest pairs of characters on television.\nTires\ndebuted on Netflix last year with just six episodes, feeling almost like a trial run more than a full season of TV. That said, the series is seriously inexpensive to produce and doesn\u2019t need to be a\nStranger Things\n-level hit to give Netflix a good return on investment.\nThe fact that it was renewed for Season 2 before the series had even debuted\nwas a great sign for the future of\nTires\n.\nThose great signs have continued into 2025, as the second installment of\nTires\nwas released on Netflix last week. Netflix doubled up on the commitment to the series, with Season 2 getting 12 episodes instead of another six, allowing\nTires\nto actually dig more into an ongoing story and bring in some bigger guest stars. The result has been a substantial hit for the streaming service;\nTires\nhas been near the top of Netflix\u2019s TV rankings every day since it returned on June 5th. Monday\u2019s edition of the Top 10 TV Shows list sees\nTires\nin the number two spot in North America.\nNot only is the second season of\nTires\ntwice as long and even more popular, but it is also an all-around better show than it was in Season 1 (which was very good in its own right). Gerben gets a much bigger opportunity to shine and explore the confident side of his character, while Gillis has room to dive into the insecurities we don\u2019t usually see from him. Both characters are given ample time to become richer, which in turn allows them to be even funnier this time around.\nSeason 2 of\nTires\nis also buoyed by a huge roster of comedic guest stars. Thomas Haden Church comes in for several episodes as the father of Gillis\u2019 mechanic, taking an interest in the business itself and setting himself up as one of the show\u2019s most important characters. The season also features guest spots from Vince Vaughn, Jon Lovitz, Ron White, and others. With the success of the series here in this second installment, we\u2019ll likely see even more big guests in the all-but-certain Season 3.\n[RELATED: Netflix Unveils Infuriating User Interface Overhaul]\nNetflix has several great comedies running at the moment, including\nSurvival of the Thickest\nand\nRunning Point\n. Those shows are absolutely worth investing time into, but\nTires\nmight be the funniest of the bunch. A lot of the humor is dark, and some of it is designed to push buttons, but it\u2019s never punching down, which is often the element that a lot of that type of comedy seems to forget.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood to laugh,\nTires\nshould be the next thing added to your Netflix watchlist, especially now that Season 2 has been released.

broader espionage campaign linked to China-nexus threat actors.\nTracked under the activity clusters PurpleHaze and ShadowPad, these operations spanned from July 2024 to March 2025, affecting over 70 organizations worldwide across sectors like government, media, manufacturing, finance, and telecommunications.\nPersistent Threats from China-Nexus Actors Uncovered\nThe report sheds light on a rarely discussed aspect of cyber threats: the deliberate targeting of cybersecurity vendors, who are high-value targets due to their protective roles and deep visibility into client environments.\n- Advertisement -\nSentinelLABS confirmed that despite the persistent efforts, SentinelOne\u2019s infrastructure, software, and hardware assets remained uncompromised, thanks to robust monitoring and rapid response mechanisms.\nThe PurpleHaze cluster, active between September and October 2024, included reconnaissance activities against SentinelOne\u2019s Internet-facing servers, alongside intrusions into a South Asian government entity and a European media organization.\nTechnical analysis revealed the use of the GOREshell backdoor a variant of the open-source reverse_ssh tool deployed with sophisticated obfuscation techniques like Garble and UPX packing.\nInfrastructure overlaps, such as the shared C2 domain downloads.trendav[.]vip resolving to IP 142.93.214[.]219, linked these attacks to a China-operated Operational Relay Box (ORB) network, often associated with groups like APT15 and UNC5174, a suspected initial access broker for China\u2019s Ministry of State Security.\nCybersecurity Vendor Targeting\nThe exploitation of\nzero-day vulnerabilities\n, including CVE-2024-8963 and CVE-2024-8190 in Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance, underscores the advanced capabilities of these actors, who gained footholds days before public disclosure.\nAdditionally, the ShadowPad malware, obfuscated with ScatterBrain, was deployed in a separate wave of attacks from June 2024 to March 2025, targeting global entities and an IT logistics provider linked to SentinelOne.\nA notable instance involved the AppSov.exe sample, executed via PowerShell to download malicious payloads from compromised internal systems, highlighting the layered persistence and\ndata exfiltration\ntactics employed.\nAccording to the\nReport\n, SentinelLABS also documented the use of publicly available tools like dsniff version 2.5a1 by The Hacker\u2019s Choice community in these intrusions, marking a novel application in APT contexts.\nThe report emphasizes the strategic intent behind targeting cybersecurity firms, aiming to disrupt protective mechanisms and potentially access downstream entities.\nBy sharing detailed indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical insights, SentinelLABS advocates for transparency and collaboration within the industry to counter such persistent threats.\nThe attribution to China-nexus actors with high confidence, combined with the reuse of private SSH keys across multiple campaigns, points to a coordinated and evolving threat landscape that demands constant vigilance and intelligence sharing.\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\nTo

defense minister threatened military action against a tiny aid ship carrying activists attempting to break the blockade on Gaza, the IDF intercepted the boat and detained all on board. The dangerous vessel was armed with rice and baby formula.\nLate on Sunday night, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC)\nsaid\nthe ship, named the \u2018Madleen,\u2019 was \u201cunder assault in international waters,\u201d with quadcopter drones surrounding the vessel and \u201cspraying it with a white irritant substance.\u201d\nThe group later published a\nstatement\n, saying the Madleen was \u201cattacked/forcibly intercepted by the Israeli military at 3:02am [Central European Time] in international waters at 31.95236\u00b0 N, 32.38880\u00b0 E.

And yet, Israel\u2019s Minister of Genocide just acknowleged a full-blown blockade on humanitarian assistance.\nAs the Madleen approached Gaza over the weekend, the activists faced increasing harassment from Israel, including GPS jamming, as well as close calls with military speed boats and drones.\nIsrael has used violence to prevent activist aid ships from reaching Gaza on more than one occasion in the past \u2013 most recently last month, when a small FFC vessel headed for the enclave was\nstruck by a drone\nin international waters.\nIn 2010,\nIsraeli troops killed 10 activists\nafter raiding another boat attempting to bring supplies to Gaza, with the UN concluding some were shot \u201cin a manner consistent with an extra-legal, arbitrary and summary execution.\u201d\nThe presence of Greta Thunberg, a climate activist widely known across the West, is likely the only thing that prevented a similarly bloody fate for the Madleen.\nFortunately, US Senator Lindsey Graham did not have his way.

The round, led by Canapi Ventures, brings Rally\u2019s total funding to just under $20 million and sets the stage for its next chapter in transforming how teams interact with users.\nFounded on the belief that \u201c\ngreat products begin with great research\n,\u201d Rally has carved a niche in making user research fast, accessible, and scalable across entire organizations. not just user experience (UX) teams. Since its last funding round, the company has observed a dramatic shift: designers, product managers, and cross-functional teams are increasingly taking ownership of research, yet the tools they\u2019ve had until now haven\u2019t kept up. That\u2019s where Rally comes in.\nBy automating complex logistical tasks like participant recruitment, scheduling, incentive payments, and compliance, Rally allows teams to focus on having authentic, impactful conversations with users. According to the company\u2019s blog, Rally has already helped brands like Adobe, MongoDB, Sonos, GitLab, and Monzo engage with more than 10 million users through its platform. The outcome? Some teams have seen their research output quadruple.\n\u201cResearch Ops isn\u2019t just a function \u2014 it\u2019s the foundation. And we believe it will be core to how every modern company learns, builds, and wins,\u201d said Co-Founder and CEO Oren Friedman in a\nLinkedIn\npost. He also mentioned that their goal is simple \u2014 to build the best User Research CRM out there for their users, and with them.\nFriedman, who previously worked at PayPal as a strategy associate brings deep operational and product insight to the startup. His co-founder, Alec Robins, formerly a software engineer at Facebook, HubSpot and having worked as a web developer too, adds a blend of technical and strategic muscle to Rally\u2019s core team. Their experience in scaling product infrastructure for fast-growing companies laid the foundation for Rally\u2019s own approach: research shouldn\u2019t be a bottleneck, it should be an accelerant.\nThe platform\u2019s evolution has been fast-paced. Over the past year, Rally has launched new features like\nObserver Rooms\nand\nFocus Groups\n, rolled out\nRally for Teams\nto enhance collaboration and governance, and introduced integrations with Snowflake, Salesforce, Marvin, and Respondent.io. These developments not only enhance usability but align Rally more closely with enterprise-grade workflows.\n\u201cRally offers a centralized platform to manage all aspects of UX research, allowing researchers to focus more on insights and less on logistics,\u201d said Braden King, senior UX researcher at Webflow.\nLooking ahead, Rally plans to double down on AI-powered automation and scale its enterprise offerings. The team is hiring across product, engineering, and go-to-market roles to meet growing demand. As user research becomes a shared responsibility across companies, Rally aims to be the infrastructure behind it.\nThe founders believe that the funding isn\u2019t just about growth, it\u2019s about changing how companies build, with their users, every step of the way. \u201cAt Rally, we\u2019re here to power that shift,\u201d they said in their\nblog\n, \u201cA movement where everyone building products can hear from their users, every step of the way.\u201d\nThe post\nRally UXR raises $11 million to make user research a team sport, not a slog\nappeared first on\nThe American Bazaar\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Streamlined, accessible user research is in growing demand|Rally UXR secured $11 million Series A funding|Rally's total funding now approaches $20 million|Rally aims to transform how teams interact with users|Research Ops is foundational for modern companies|Rally plans to double down on AI-powered automation and scale enterprise offerings;E:Rally UXR announced Series A funding round|Designers, product managers, and cross-functional teams are increasingly taking ownership of research|Rally has helped brands engage with over 10 million users|Rally launched new features like Observer Rooms and Focus Groups|Rally rolled out Rally for Teams|Rally introduced integrations with Snowflake, Salesforce, Marvin, and Respondent.io;D:Series A funding amount: $11 million|Total funding: Just under $20 million|Research output quadrupled for some teams|Over 10 million users engaged through Rally's platform|;", "er_digest": "N:Canapi Ventures|Salesforce|Oren Friedman|Adobe|Alec Robins;R:United States;", "gist": "P:Streamlined, accessible user research is in growing demand|Rally UXR secured $11 million Series A funding|Rally's total funding now approaches $20 million|Rally aims to transform how teams interact with users|Research Ops is foundational for modern companies|Rally plans to double down on AI-powered automation and scale enterprise offerings;E:Rally UXR announced Series A funding round|Designers, product managers, and cross-functional teams are increasingly taking ownership of research|Rally has helped brands engage with over 10 million users|Rally launched new features like Observer Rooms and Focus Groups|Rally rolled out Rally for Teams|Rally introduced integrations with Snowflake, Salesforce, Marvin, and Respondent.io;D:Series A funding amount: $11 million|Total funding: Just under $20 million|Research output quadrupled for some teams|Over 10 million users engaged through Rally's platform|N:Canapi Ventures|Salesforce|Oren Friedman|Adobe|Alec Robins;R:United States;", "entities": ["Canapi Ventures", "Salesforce", "Oren Friedman", "Adobe", "Alec Robins"], "regions": ["United States"]}, {"_id": "https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/nasa-spots-dramatic-shrinkage-in-africa/", "content": "Lake Chad\n, once one of the largest natural lakes in the world, has seen a dramatic decline in its size over the past several decades. The lake, straddling the borders of\nChad\n,\nNigeria\n,\nNiger\n, and\nCameroon\n, was a critical source of water for millions of people and a hub for agriculture, fishing, and trade. However, due to a combination of\ndroughts\n,\nclimate change\n, and increasing demand for water,\nLake Chad\nis rapidly shrinking, leading to widespread\neconomic\nand\nenvironmental\nimpacts across the region. In this article, we will explore the past, present, and future of this vital body of water, drawing insights from\nNASA Earth Observatory\u2019s observations\n, including recent imagery that reveals the lake\u2019s diminished waters and fragile wetlands.\nThe Shocking Decline of Lake Chad\nLake Chad\nwas once one of the largest freshwater bodies in Africa, but over the past 60 years, it has lost more than\n90%\nof its surface area. According to NASA, \u201cOngoing droughts and the rising demand for fresh water have shrunk the lake to less than a tenth of the area it covered in the middle of the last century.\u201d This dramatic shrinkage has turned the vast expanse of water into a fragmented series of wetlands and scattered pools, altering the entire ecosystem and threatening the livelihoods of millions of people dependent on it.\nIn the early 1960s, Lake Chad covered an area of roughly\n25,000 square kilometers\n. Today, that size has been reduced to less than\n2,000 square kilometers\n, a change that has led to a cascade of consequences for the region. The shrinking lake is a result of several factors, including\nclimate change\n, which has brought about changes in rainfall patterns, and human activities like\nirrigation\nand\noverfishing\n. These conditions have made the region increasingly vulnerable to water scarcity, food insecurity, and\nconflict\n.\nEnvironmental and Ecological Impact\nThe ecological toll of the lake\u2019s shrinkage is staggering. As the waters recede, ecosystems that once thrived around the lake have been decimated.\nFish populations\n, vital for both\nlocal economies\nand\nfood security\n, have been severely impacted by the shrinking water levels and overfishing. Species such as\ntilapia\n,\ncatfish\n, and\nNile perch\nhave seen a dramatic reduction in numbers, disrupting the local fishing industry that many communities depend on for survival.\nMoreover, the changing conditions have had a significant impact on\nwildlife\nin the region. The wetlands surrounding the lake once served as vital habitats for migratory birds, including species like\nherons\n,\nstorks\n, and\ngeese\n, which use the lake as a stopover on their migration routes. With the lake shrinking, these birds are increasingly struggling to find suitable habitats. Mammals, too, face challenges;\nhippos\nand\nantelope species\n, once abundant in the region, now face habitat loss due to the shrinking floodplains and wetlands.\nHistorical Record: A Glimpse Into Lake Chad\u2019s Past\nThe dramatic transformation of Lake Chad has been documented through\nNASA\u2019s astronaut photography\n, which has captured the lake over the past several decades. A key turning point in the visual record occurred during the\nApollo 7 mission\nin\n1968\n, when an astronaut aboard the spacecraft captured an image of the lake as one large body of water. This photo showed the vastness of Lake Chad in its prime, before the impact of environmental changes started to take hold.\nBy\n1982\n,\nNASA\nrecorded another photograph from the\nSpace Shuttle mission STS-5\n, which revealed the first signs of the lake\u2019s receding water levels and the growing presence of\nsand dunes\naround its perimeter. As the decades passed, the shrinking lake became increasingly visible in satellite images, with\n2015\u2019s\nphotograph from\nExpedition 42\non the\nInternational Space Station\ncapturing the lake\u2019s reduced size and fragmented wetlands. This image, showing the lake in\ndark green, blue, and brown\n, starkly contrasts with the surrounding sandy land, highlighting the ongoing environmental changes.\nThe Geopolitical Implications of Lake Chad\u2019s Decline\nLake Chad is not only a\ngeographic\nand\necological\nlandmark; it is also a\npolitical\nand\neconomic\nfocal point for the region. The lake serves as a vital resource for the four countries it borders, and its shrinking has exacerbated tensions and conflict, particularly in areas where\nwater scarcity\nis already a pressing issue. The\ninsurgency\nled by\nBoko Haram\nin northeastern Nigeria has displaced millions of people and further complicated efforts to manage and protect the fragile ecosystem of Lake Chad.\nAs the water recedes, competition for the remaining resources\u2014primarily water and fertile land\u2014has intensified. Local communities have faced increasing challenges, and\nfood insecurity\nhas become a growing concern. This has led to both internal and cross-border tensions, as local groups vie for access to the lake\u2019s diminishing resources.\nEnjoyed this article?\nSubscribe to our free newsletter\nfor engaging stories, exclusive content, and the latest news.\nFor more news like this, visit\nDailygalaxy.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Decline of Lake Chad|Environmental Impacts|Economic Impacts|Geopolitical Implications|Water Scarcity|Food Insecurity;E:Dramatic shrinkage of Lake Chad over past 60 years|Loss of 90% of surface area|NASA observations documenting decline|Apollo 7 mission image in 1968|Space Shuttle mission STS-5 image in 1982|Expedition 42 image in 2015|Boko Haram insurgency exacerbating tensions;D:25,000 square kilometers (original size)|2,000 square kilometers (current size)|90% surface area loss|Droughts and climate change as contributing factors|Irrigation and overfishing contributing factors|Impact on fish populations (tilapia, catfish, Nile perch);", "er_digest": "N:Expedition 42;R:Cameroon|Nigeria|Niger|Africa|Chad;", "gist": "P:Decline of Lake Chad|Environmental Impacts|Economic Impacts|Geopolitical Implications|Water Scarcity|Food Insecurity;E:Dramatic shrinkage of Lake Chad over past 60 years|Loss of 90% of surface area|NASA observations documenting decline|Apollo 7 mission image in 1968|Space Shuttle mission STS-5 image in 1982|Expedition 42 image in 2015|Boko Haram insurgency exacerbating tensions;D:25,000 square kilometers (original size)|2,000 square kilometers (current size)|90% surface area loss|Droughts and climate change as contributing factors|Irrigation and overfishing contributing factors|Impact on fish populations (tilapia, catfish, Nile perch);N:Expedition 42;R:Cameroon|Nigeria|Niger|Africa|Chad;", "entities": ["Expedition 42"], "regions": ["Cameroon", "Nigeria", "Niger", "Africa", "Chad"]}, {"_id": "https://americanbazaaronline.com/2025/06/09/bitcoin-buyer-metaplanet-plans-to-raise-5-4-billion-463493/", "content": "Metaplanet, a Tokyo-listed investment company has revealed plans to raise $5.4 billion by issuing 555 million shares.

What\u2019s your evidence?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nYeah. So the claim is pretty well substantiated in political science literature, and I\u2019m trying to raise that here in the D.C. world, that there\u2019s been a long, steady, bipartisan decline in how Congress approaches its oversight. And there\u2019s been a decline, in particular, in the number of hearings that Congress has been holding \u2014 and oversight hearings \u2014 and that even within those hearings, if you take a look under the hood at who\u2019s testifying, there\u2019s been a decline in the number of executive branch witnesses appearing before Congress, as well as inspectors general and GAO entities kind of providing oversight information to the Congress.\nTerry Gerton:\nSo it\u2019s a bipartisan affliction. Is one party better than the other at this process?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nLooking at the data across the years, it seems to be pretty equal on both sides. There\u2019s been a turn over the past 20 or 30 years away from bipartisan, fact-based investigative oversight toward more gotcha politics that is somewhat less substantive \u2014 might be more focused on blaming individuals and officials for certain outcomes rather than focusing on identifying policy solutions for moving forward. All of those things kind of contribute to a more hollow, less informed oversight process.\nTerry Gerton:\nWhat would you say makes for a good oversight committee hearing?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nSo a couple things. Some of this has been identified by political scientists. A lot of it has been identified by the now-defunct Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. And there are a couple of things. One is, are the majority and minority parties engaging with each other in setting the agenda for oversight hearings? Are they coming up at the beginning of the Congress or beginning of the year, or even beginning of a month, saying these are the things we want to tackle, here are the types of questions we want to dive into, here are the types of people we want to hear from, and the issues that we\u2019re concerned about? And so from agenda-setting through toward when they decide to have a hearing and they\u2019re going to engage witnesses, are they asking questions that are trying to get at the substantive policy material versus trying to maybe form soundbites that go viral and feed into other incentives that members might have beyond just the policymaking?\nTerry Gerton:\nAre there structural features that keep that from happening, or is it more of a cultural challenge?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nIt\u2019s a little bit of both. When there is divided government, there might be more incentive for engaging on a bipartisan basis, rather than when there\u2019s a unified government. But some of the structural issues are that committee staff sizes have shrunk over the past 30 years. There\u2019s a lot of turnover in committee staff. So you lose a lot of that institutional knowledge of how the executive branch works and how the oversight committees have engaged with the executive branch in the past. There\u2019s also just basic technology problems. Up until the beginning of last Congress, committees didn\u2019t have e-discovery tools, so they couldn\u2019t process all of the information that they were getting from the executive or from other entities in a coherent manner to inform their work. And so there\u2019s, across the board, a capacity and resource problem that Congress faces \u2014 and congressional committees face \u2014 that helps them make sense of what they should be doing on any particular issue. And there have been recommendations put forward. The bulk purchasing of e-discovery tools was one of them that has been implemented. Another one that\u2019s been suggested is to offer bipartisan oversight training for congressional staff so that they know how to engage on a bipartisan basis in fact-based oversight.\nTerry Gerton:\nSo you mentioned this capacity challenge, but both the House and the Senate have dedicated oversight committees. The legislative branch also has GAO and the Congressional Research Service. So altogether, are those groups able to do their jobs? Are they doing their jobs?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nSo the point I make in the piece is I think the inspectors general, GAO, are very much doing their jobs. There\u2019s been 14,000 recommendations put forward by Offices of Inspector General. There\u2019s another 5,000 put forward by GAO. The problem is that those recommendations are maybe not getting into the decision-making pipeline of Congress because of the decline in the number of hearings that oversight committees \u2014 not just the Oversight Committee, but oversight subcommittees and all committees in general \u2014 have been having. Part of that decline is the result of a shift in incentives for members of Congress away from committee work toward more leadership-centered lawmaking and legislating. So they put their time in elsewhere. Another piece of it is, as previous BPC research highlights, not only has there been a decline in hearings, but the hearings that Congress does have are all stacked on top of each other. There are time conflicts. So when you watch a hearing and you see a member pop in and pop out, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re not interested or going to do something else \u2014 it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re running between three, maybe four hearings at the same time. And so when they are engaged in oversight, it\u2019s hard for them to really drill down into the substance of any one particular hearing because they have so many competing demands on their time.\nTerry Gerton:\nI\u2019m speaking with J.D. Rackey. He\u2019s a senior policy analyst in the Structural Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. I have been a witness in many of those hearings where people pop in and pop out and three people are sitting on the dais and maybe someone else comes in and asks their questions and departs. So it really does get back to the capacity question, I think. And your paper does make some specific recommendations for reform. Scheduling is one of them. But there\u2019s one that I\u2019m really interested in \u2014 you recommend that Congress should establish a bipartisan, bicameral commission on evidence-based policymaking to encourage and facilitate better use in the legislative process. They passed a law for the executive branch to tell them to do that in 2018. Are you suggesting here that Congress takes a little bit of its own medicine?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nYes, and I\u2019m not the first to suggest this. That recommendation comes from the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, of which I was a staff member. I should be transparent about that. But BPC has long been supportive of this effort, as well as getting more evidence into policymaking work both in the executive branch and within Congress. And what the Modernization Committee found and why they recommended this commission is that, by and large, there\u2019s a misperception that Congress just doesn\u2019t know anything \u2014 that it doesn\u2019t have enough expertise. The problem is not a want for information. The problem is one of operationalizing the information it does have, both internally and that it receives externally. And just as I was referencing earlier, the tools and infrastructure within Congress are so severely outdated and nonexistent that the committee recommended this Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission to do a real deep dive into what tools and structures need to be either created or shifted within the Congress to make it better able to use the data that is already being supplied to it on one hand, and as society continues to evolve and grow, how can it maybe start intaking even more information into the policymaking process?\nTerry Gerton:\nHow do you assess the odds of a commission like that being established?\nJ.D. Rackey:\nWell, the bill to create it was just reintroduced, I think like a week ago, by Mr. Timmons and Mr. Peters on a bipartisan basis. This is the third Congress that it will have been introduced on a bipartisan basis, but each time it is reintroduced, I think the conversation moves a little bit forward. Anyone in D.C. knows it takes a long time to get any forward action, particularly through Congress. So I think it\u2019s slow going, but I continue to be hopeful that Congress is moving forward and coming around to the idea that it needs to make better use of its data. Case in point: a baby step toward that this commission could build on is the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act. This was an act passed a couple of years ago saying that Congress mandates all of these reports from the executive branch all the time, and they end up somewhere. We don\u2019t know where. We don\u2019t even know how many reports are mandated of agencies. So they passed this bill to create a portal where all of those reports live. And that portal is now live. It\u2019s maintained by GPO. And so the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission could then look at that portal, say, OK, now we have a repository of reports. What\u2019s the next step toward getting that repository into regular, everyday use of congressional staff, of members, and things like that?\nTerry Gerton:\nWell, as you say, baby steps, but maybe progress.\nJ.D. Rackey:\nI like to think it\u2019s progress.\nThe post\nAn objective look at Congress\u2019 ability to conduct effective oversight\nfirst appeared on\nFederal News Network\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Decline in Congressional oversight|Bipartisan decline in oversight|Shift towards \"gotcha politics\"|Shrinking committee staff sizes|Outdated technology hindering oversight|Need for bipartisan oversight training|Capacity challenge due to competing demands|Misperception of Congress lacking expertise|Problem is operationalizing information, not lack of it;E:Congress neglecting oversight role|Congressional hearings declining|Executive branch witnesses appearing less frequently|Hearings stacked on top of each other|Reintroduction of Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission bill;D:14,000 recommendations from Inspectors General|5,000 recommendations from GAO|Committee staff sizes have shrunk|Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports Act passed|Portal for congressionally mandated reports now live|United States;", "er_digest": "N:Federal News Network|Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress|Mr. Timmons|Congress|Terry Gerton|GAO|Bipartisan Policy Center|Mr. Peters|J.D.

Japanese developer Enhance took the core\nTetris\nformula, one of the most familiar and easy to pick and play in the world, and made it a psychedelic audiovisual experience featuring amazing music from Hydelic and trippy level themes. It\u2019s amazing on a flatscreen TV or in\nVR\n, but I always wondered if it was the kind of experience that was only possible with\nTetris\n. I was happy to be proven wrong when I played\nLumines Arise\nat Summer Game Fest Play Days.\nFor those unfamiliar with\nLumines\n, it\u2019s a puzzle game series that began on PSP in 2004. It\u2019s a block-dropping game like Tetris, but is centered around matching parts of multi-colored squares to create 4\u00d74 or bigger blocks. Every few seconds, something called the \u201cTimeline\u201d makes its way across the screen and clears any of those created blocks. It\u2019s simple, but you can create some truly massive blocks or big score-delivering combos if you know how to place each square and some deeper gameplay techniques like cascading. If you loved\nLumines\nbefore, you\u2019ll be happy to know it receives the full\nTetris\nEffect\ntreatment with\nArise\n.\nWith\nLumines Arise\n, Enhance once again reimagines the audiovisual experience around an incredibly solid puzzle game formula. The one new mechanic is called Burst. Players build up Burst over time and can then activate it. Doing so creates a specific big block of a certain color that players are given time to expand. When Burst ends, all of those blocks are cleared and you\u2019ll feel much better positioned to continue connecting blocks and creating combos.\nI saw this new feature in action across three different stages in the demo I played at Summer Game Fest Play Days. One simply featured bright blocks, as I saw a man walking in the background. The next had been attaching machinery with spider-like webs. The final saw chameleons flank each side of the stage, and they bopped along to the song or any massive combos I made. The chameleon one in particular really stuck out in the way\nTetris Effect\u2019s\nbest levels did, so I have the confidence that some real gems will be scattered about\nLumines Arise\u2019s\nthirty different stages.\nA developer from Enhance told me that he believes\nLumines\nis harder to learn than\nTetris\n, but easier to master. I definitely felt that during my time with\nLumines Arise\n. I really struggled through my initial playthrough of three levels. I not only had to relearn what I knew about\nLumines\n, but also accommodate an overwhelming visual presentation as well. With a wider board and emphasis on block-falling combos, there\u2019s definitely a lot more going on in a game of\nLumines Arise\nthan\nTetris Effect\n.\nWhile I struggled at first, once I got back into the groove of\nLumines\n\u2018 gameplay, I could take a step back and take in the beautiful presentation of it all more. Once I settled in like that,\nLumines Arise\nreally started to sing, both metaphorically and literally. While it might not feel as instantly iconic as\nTetris Effect\nin, I have no doubt I will soon lose countless hours to\nLumines Arise\n. From\nTetris Effect\nto\nHumanity\n, Enhance has cemented itself as not only one of the best puzzle game developers out there, but one of the best creators of audiovisual experiences as well. The track record seems set to continue with this new game.\nLumines Arise\nis slated to be released on PC and PS5, with VR support, sometime later this year.

(KMIZ)\nMizzou softball coach Larissa Anderson's 2026 roster will officially feature the 2024-25 Missouri Softball Gatorade Player of the Year, after Lafayette High School pitcher Abby Carr earned the honor, on Monday.\nThe award is widely known as the top honor in all of high school sports. It goes to the nation's best high school athletes for their success on the field, in the classroom and in the community.\nCarr was named the best softball player in all of Missouri, after an impressive senior season. The 6-foot right-handed pitcher led Lafayette to a Class 5 state championship win over Rock Bridge in her final high school season. She put up a stunning performance in that title game, tossing a 16-strikeout, eight-inning, no-hitter to lift her team to the holy grail.\nOverall, she finished the 2024 campaign undefeated in the circle, 23-0, with a 0.24 earned run average. The Wildwood, Missouri native struck out 304 batters and issued just 26 walks in 144.2 total innings. But, she was a dual-threat for the Lancers, as well. She batted .476 with 29 RBI, 10 home runs and 35 runs scored, posting an OPS of 1.590.\nCarr finished her Lafayette career in the record books, as she holds the career-best in strikeouts, ERA, doubles, home runs and batting average. Her dominant high school career shows just why she's ranked as the No. 27 recruit in the nation by Perfect Game, No. 31 by Prep Softball and No. 41 by Extra Inning.\nThe Gatorade Player of the Year is one of the big highlights of Coach Anderson's six-member 2025 signing class, which will arrive on campus for the 2025-26 school year. Carr will be the 13th Mizzou player from the state of Missouri to win the Gatorade award, joining fellow pitcher Cierra Harrison and recently graduated All-American catcher Julia Crenshaw.

Discovery (WBD) would be\nsplitting into two companies\n: one that houses its TV and movie studio along with its Max (soon to be HBO Max) streaming service and another that houses its legacy assets, including the TNT Sports family of cable networks.\nIt was an expected move. Last December, the company\nrestructured internally along those lines\n. In April, CNBC reported that the company had\nhired bankers\nto explore its split options. And now, it is finally happening.\nWBD is the second major media company to opt for a split or spin. Earlier this year, Comcast announced it would launch\nVersant\n, a spinoff entity that will include most of the NBCUniversal cable portfolio, including USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Golf Channel, and others.\nThe move obviously has massive implications for sports fans. TNT Sports owns numerous prevalent live sports rights in the United States, and its split from WBD will impact how and where fans can access those games.\nSimilarly to Versant\n, WBD\u2019s new entity, which is temporarily being called Global Networks, will have to navigate its future without direct access to a broadcast network or a streaming service.\nHowever, unlike Versant, which is primarily\nacquiring the scraps of NBC\u2019s larger live sports portfolio\n, Global Networks is acquiring the entire enchilada from WBD. That means the:\nNCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament (through 2032)\nMLB (through 2028)\nNHL (through 2028)\nCollege Football Playoff (through 2028)\nNASCAR (through 2031)\nFrench Open (through 2034)\nFor individuals who access TNT properties through a traditional pay-TV bundle, not much will change. The question becomes how these networks will be distributed digitally as more consumers move to streaming and cable goes the way of the dodo. In the interim, TNT Sports properties will continue to stream through Max, per the company\u2019s investor call discussing the move on Monday. But that will be a temporary solution. At some point, TNT Sports will need to find a streaming partner willing to license its content for its platform. And given TNT\u2019s live sports portfolio, that may prove more challenging than it seems.\nCurrently, the list of sports rights appears favorable on paper. College Football Playoff inventory,\nwhich will now include a semifinal game\n, is must-have content. So is March Madness and, to a lesser extent, parts of the NHL and MLB postseasons. The issue is that, other than March Madness, all of those rights expire in three years. How can TNT Sports, absent consolidation with a major streaming service or broadcast network, afford to compete for those expensive rights? Especially when much of WBD\u2019s current debt load is being saddled onto the new venture.\nWBD\u2019s entire U.S.-based sports division is being put on an island. For now, the networks will survive off of existing carriage agreements. They\u2019ll save some money by not having to pay for NBA rights, though the league\u2019s absence will put a\nsizeable dent in its advertising business\n.\nHowever, this isn\u2019t a question about how TNT will survive for the next few years. This is a question about how TNT will survive for the next 10 years or if that\u2019s even possible.\nOne thing looks certain: it will be imperative for the new entity to find a company (or companies) willing to pay to license its live sports content. Otherwise, TNT will struggle to renew any meaningful rights. And in three years\u2019 time, if TNT loses the CFP, MLB, and NHL all in the same calendar year, what league or conference would willingly sign a new agreement with the network without the reach of a broadcast network or the growing userbase of a streamer? Doing so would be hopping on a sinking ship.\nAs it stands, TNT will likely already have to pay a premium for sports rights compared to other potential bidders, given its limited reach, which isn\u2019t exactly an attractive move considering the company\u2019s massive debt load.\nIt isn\u2019t easy to see how TNT can dig itself out of this hole. The question becomes, how can the network leverage its currently valuable sports portfolio while it still can? Does a prominent streaming platform like Amazon, Apple, or Netflix have any interest? Do those companies think TNT\u2019s portfolio can drive subscriptions?\nIf you listened to WBD CEO David Zaslav during Monday\u2019s call, those rights didn\u2019t do much to drive Max subscriptions. Could that be different on another platform? Maybe.\nCould a tie-up with Versant make sense? Perhaps, though\n, Versant CEO Mark Lazarus has already made clear that\nhe doesn\u2019t want to acquire any debt-ridden\ncompanies\n.\nHowever, perhaps there are\nalternative arrangements to be considered\noutside of an outright acquisition.\nThen there are wildcards. Maybe Paramount, under new ownership, wants to make a splash in live sports? Does Fox see value in the TNT Sports portfolio as it prepares to launch Fox One? There are several possibilities, but finding an arrangement that proves mutually beneficial to both TNT and the other party becomes significantly more challenging.\nUltimately, what we\u2019re witnessing is the late stages of a cable network\u2019s declining business. And while the outlook may seem grim, there is still much that needs to unfold. It\u2019s not time to dig TNT\u2019s grave just yet, but we\u2019re approaching life support. These next three years will be critical for the network\u2019s long-term survival, so much as \u201csurvival\u201d is even a possibility for cable networks a decade from now.\nThe post\nTNT Sports is approaching life support after WBD split\nappeared first on\nAwful Announcing\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Warner Bros.

From the report: The new streaming-and-studios company will include Warner Bros, DC Studios and HBO Max - the crown jewels of WBD's entertainment library. The networks unit, which will hold up to a 20% stake in its counterpart, will house CNN, TNT Sports and Bleacher Report.

The team is led by a pitcher who is purportedly a transgender girl, as argued in lawsuits filed against the state earlier this year.\nGaines mocked the Minnesota State High School League\u2019s post congratulating the Champlin Park team on its state championship, calling the pitcher \u201ca boy.\u201d\nIn response, Biles wrote that Gaines\u2019 attacks on the trans community stem from being a \u201csore loser,\u201d referencing Gaines\u2019 entry into activism after finishing behind transgender UPenn swimmer Lia Thomas in the NCAA championships in 2022.\nBiles encouraged Gaines to work toward solutions rather than \u201cbully\u201d targets like the Champlin Park pitcher.\n\u201cYou\u2019re truly sick, all of this campaigning because you lost a race.

Hook wanted to know just how vital a hero is to a nation\u2019s history. There is no simple answer.\nIn the US, we have had many heroes including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. But Washington could have lost the Revolutionary War had he failed at Trenton and Monmouth, after he was defeated in New York and Harlem Heights. And Lincoln\u2019s generals could have seized Washington and put Lincoln in jail, splitting the US in half. Even short of a coup, Lincoln could have lost the 1864 election to General George McClellan, who would have cut a deal with Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his former colleague, Robert E. Lee.\nGreat scientists can also be heroes but are not always well-treated. The cryptographic genius Alan Turing, whose work decoding Nazi encrypted messages helped win World War II, should have been honored. Instead, he was convicted of homosexuality in 1952 and sentenced to harsh chemical treatments to \u201ccure\u201d him of his \u201cdisease.\u201d The brutality of the so-called cure aside, his self-esteem was crushed.\nHe took cyanide and died in 1954.\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer, another top scientist, assembled one of the greatest scientific and industrial teams at Los Alamos.\nBut he was persecuted by the Atomic Energy Commission on grounds that he had communist associations (which he did) which rendered him unreliable (never proven).\nThe fact that his work gave the US the atomic bomb, which saved tens of thousands of American lives, was disregarded. Oppenheimer lost his security clearances and was humiliated and his service to his country ended.\nThe truth is that Oppenheimer was an opponent of building a hydrogen bomb, which Edward Teller called the Super. Pulling Oppenheimer\u2019s clearances got him out of the way.\nHeroes with social and political problems are nothing new.\nWerner von Braun, the brilliant German rocket scientist, ran the Nazi V-1 and V-2 operations at Peenemunde during World War II. As the Tom Lehrer song laments, \u201cThe widows and orphans in old London town owe their large pensions to Werner von Braun.\u201d Von Braun was a Nazi, and he ruthlessly employed slave labor at Peenemunde and elsewhere to build his weapons.\nHe was recruited as part of the\nnotorious Paperclip program\nto the United States and became the key Army rocket scientist at the US Army Redstone Arsenal. Later he headed NASA\u2019s Saturn V rocket development. He thus was a hero for the Nazis and a hero for the Americans.\nElon Musk\nThis brings us to Elon Musk, today America\u2019s greatest industrialist. He is in a bitter quarrel with President Trump, and his future relationship to the Trump administration is uncertain. While Musk, like other heroes, has his good and bad points, he is needed to help protect American national security, or to put it another way, Elon Musk is a national security asset and probably meets the criteria laid down by Sydney Hook: that is, we need him to save our defense manufacturing system, which is unacceptably costly, slow, inefficient and can\u2019t keep up with demand in times of crisis.\nSo far Musk has done some incredible things that are changing the security landscape. Space-X, for example, has changed the space launch industry by redefining how rockets are launched and recovered. Prior to Musk, a multimillion-dollar rocket launch was a onetime affair. Again, quoting Tom Lehrer on Von Braun, \u201cOnce the rockets go up, who cares where they come down? That\u2019s not my department, says Werner von Braun.\u201d\nNASA has long taken the same approach. Launch the rockets and let them, once used, crash into the sea. But Musk thought rockets should be reusable. He devised ways for booster rockets to successfully land either on ships (one of them is named \u201cJust Read the Instructions\u201d) or on land. The recovered boosters could be refurbished and used again \u2013 one of them (so far) as many as nine times.\nThis capability, along with devising a mass-manufacturing system for rockets, enabled Musk to put up the Starlink constellation, a highly innovative broadband communications platform. He already has launched 8,877 satellites into orbit (6,715 currently operating) and plans to put as many as 42,000 in orbit. There is no space manufacturing and launch company anywhere in the world that can launch that many spacecraft.\nStarlink & Space-X in warfighting\nStarlink has already proven vital to warfighting.\nWithout Starlink, Ukraine would be without effective battlefield communications and would be limited in the range of its drones and other weapons.\nBecause there are so many satellites, jamming Starlink is difficult, maybe ultimately impossible. The slow-moving Pentagon is beginning to figure this out.\nSpace-X is also of great importance if the Defense Department actually develops and deploys a space-based missile defense system. Thousands of spacecraft will be needed for Golden Dome, which may be the only way to counter hypersonic long-range missiles.\nSpace defense has been talked about since the early 1980s, but one of the reasons projects such as Brilliant Pebbles never got off the ground (literally and figuratively) is because the lift capability to do it was missing. Musk has solved that problem.\nGigafactories\nWhile Space-X and Starlink establish Musk\u2019s bona fides as a national security asset, that is far from everything.\nRemember that Musk\u2019s inventions started out as civilian projects. Starlink was to bring broadband Internet to users around the world inexpensively, without any clumsy and costly local infrastructure.\nSpace-X was to launch Starlink and other commercial spacecraft. The planned Mars mission, if he is ultimately successful, is not a defense project.\nBut the place to look toward the future is another commercial project, and that is Tesla. Tesla is a car (and truck) company featuring electric vehicles and battery power packs. Musk manufactures his cars, trucks and batteries in what he called Gigafactories.\nA Gigafactory is a highly integrated manufacturing site, using lots of robots and advanced processes, capable of producing electric vehicles and batteries.\nTesla, which invented the Gigafactory idea, has six active Gigafactories. They\u2019re in Fremont, California; Sparks, Nevada; Austin, Texas; and Buffalo, New York as well as Berlin and Shanghai. The idea of Gigafactories, at least for batteries, is spreading around the world rapidly: Today there are some 240 of them worldwide making batteries.\nMake defense efficient\nIt is noteworthy that, while electric battery and automobile manufacturing is focused on Gigafactories, this industrial idea has not gained a real foothold in defense manufacturing.\nToday, defense companies may have state-of-the-art technology, but their industrial methods don\u2019t measure up even to the standards of production achieved in World War II.\nThe missing factor is consolidating certain types of defense manufacturing in efficient factories that can produce a variety of components commonly needed for equipping our armed forces.\nFor example, tactical rockets (small, medium, and large) could be consolidated in a Gigafactory with defense companies owning a share in the business. The advantages would be profound, including a lower cost of production, the ability to switch from one model to another, a consolidated and reliable supply chain (much of it brought in-house) and design commonality, making manufacturing easier and more efficient.\nThere are many categories where a Gigafactory would make sense. Some examples: armored vehicles, ammunition production, guns of all calibers, drones, \u201cblack boxes\u201d (electronics), sensors.\nWhere Musk fits\nThe best man to figure all this out is Elon Musk, because he has been immensely successful doing it at Tesla and Space-X and because the current defense industrial establishment cannot do it on its own.\nWe have already learned from the costly and prolonged Ukraine war that our industrial base is not able to keep up with demand. We also have learned that our efforts are feeding an expensive and inefficient defense industrial system operating deep in the industrial past.\nWe cannot afford to keep shelling out vast amounts of taxpayer money (this year more than $1 trillion) to buy fewer and fewer weapons, often delivered late and with serious flaws.\nBecause of the uncertainties in defense procurement and the general lack of automation (some munitions factories are 100 years old), retaining workers is a challenge and there are severe skill shortages across the defense landscape. When you see a sign behind home plate at Yankee\u2019s stadium that reads, \u201cBuild Submarines,\u201d you understand there is an employment crisis in the industry.\nIt would make sense for President Trump to bring Elon Musk back to government, make sure he has the right access and security clearances and put him to work reinventing America\u2019s defense industry.\nStephen Bryen is a special correspondent to Asia Times and former US deputy undersecretary of defense for policy.\nThis article\n, which originally appeared on his Substack newsletter\nWeapons and Strategy\n, is republished with permission.\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nTired of the gaslighting?\nThe mainstream media told you\nEconomic sanctions would kill the Russian economy\nUS tech sanctions would shut down China\u2019s semiconductor industry\nRussia is taking massive casualties in Ukraine and will have to negotiate\nChina\u2019s property market will collapse its economy\nAnd so on, every day and in every major news outlet.

Credit: JHVEPhoto, Shutterstock\nApple has raised major concerns about the future of artificial intelligence in a new study released in June 2025, revealing that advanced systems called Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer a \u201ccomplete accuracy collapse\u201d when given complex tasks.\nPublished in the paper\nThe Illusion of Thinking\n, the findings suggest that current AI tools may fundamentally fail under pressure \u2013 despite their\ngrowing presence in everyday life\n.\nApple tests OpenAI\u2019s o3, Google\u2019s Gemini, DeepSeek, and more\nThe Apple study assessed top reasoning models like OpenAI\u2019s o3, Google\u2019s Gemini Thinking, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking, and DeepSeek-R1 using logic puzzles like Tower of Hanoi and River Crossing. These tests revealed severe performance drops as puzzle complexity increased \u2013 to the point where the models stopped trying.\nThe researchers wrote: \u2018First, despite their sophisticated self-reflection mechanisms learned through reinforcement learning, these models fail to develop generalizable problem-solving capabilities for planning tasks, with performance collapsing to zero beyond a certain complexity threshold.\u2019\nApple identified three distinct performance phases:\nLow complexity: Standard LLMs (non-reasoning models) actually performed better and were more efficient.\nMedium complexity: LRMs showed some advantage, solving more difficult tasks through longer, more detailed reasoning.\nHigh complexity: Both model types failed completely \u2013 even when provided with the correct algorithm.\nAI critic Gary Marcus called the Apple findings \u201cpretty devastating\u201d and argued they undermine hopes that today\u2019s AI can evolve into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nWriting in his newsletter and quoted by\nThe Guardian\n, Marcus said: \u201cAnybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort [of] AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves.\u201d\nApple\u2019s study also revealed an unexpected paradox. On simpler problems, LRMs frequently overthink, producing correct answers early but continuing to explore incorrect options, wasting compute. On harder problems, the opposite happens: models start to underthink, reducing reasoning effort despite increased task difficulty.\nApple also tested what happens when models are given the exact algorithm to solve a puzzle. Surprisingly, it made no difference. Even with step-by-step instructions, models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking still failed to complete complex puzzles like the Tower of Hanoi beyond a certain number of moves.\nAndrew Rogoyski of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey told\nThe Guardian\nthat Apple\u2019s study may indicate a dead end in AI development.\n\u201cThe finding that large reasoning models lose the plot on complex problems, while performing well on medium- and low-complexity problems implies that we\u2019re in a potential cul-de-sac in current approaches,\u201d he said.\nAre we hitting a wall with AI?\nApple\u2019s paper delivers a critical message: even the most advanced\nAI\nreasoning models today can only \u201cthink\u201d to a point. Beyond that, they either over-exert or give up entirely. That\u2019s not intelligence; it\u2019s pattern-matching with limits.\nView all\ntechnology news.\nTags:\nAI Artificial Intelligence\n,\nApple\n,\nDeepSeek\n,\nGoogle\n,\nOpenAI\nShare this story\nshare on WhatsApp\nshare on Flipboard\nshare on Email\nSign up for personalised news\nSubscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nBy signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

As IO Interactive began to put the idea of more Hitman sequels in the rear view mirror, it became clear that the studio\u2019s next big focus was on making a new game around the world\u2019s greatest spy.\n007 First Light\nwas formally announced\nin June with its first trailer and the title reveal. It confirms that James Bond is much younger than previous iterations and that\u2019s for a key reason, this isn\u2019t just a regular Bond story, it\u2019s an origin story. Bond\u2019s life before becoming 007 hasn\u2019t been tackled on-screen yet. We briefly see a glimpse of him earning his 007 status at the start of\nCasino Royale\n, but it\u2019s very quick and is done to show that Daniel Craig\u2019s Bond is a far more brutal and rougher take on the dapper spy. However, we will get to see James Bond\u2019s entire journey to becoming 007, as well as learn a bit about his childhood, in\n007 First Light\n.\n007 First Light\nDeveloper Explains Why They\u2019re Telling James Bond\u2019s Origin Story\n007 first light\nIO Interactive is still holding back a lot of information on\n007 First Light\n, even\nrefraining from confirming who the new James Bond actor is\nuntil later in the summer. However, ComicBook\u2019s Tanner Dedmon sat down with 007 Franchise Director Jonathan Lacaille and talked a bit about why they decided to focus on a younger Bond (he\u2019s 26 in this game). IO Interactive was interested in exploring the way Bond becomes 007 as opposed to viewing them as one in the same. Bond has a lot of the traits we know and love in the game, but it\u2019s a matter of learning how to weaponize them or using it all to his advantage.\n\u201cEveryone knows how established Bond is in the movies and when taking the approach of a young Bond, we had to think a lot about how this character was and the journey he went through to become the character that we know today,\u201d said Lacaille. \u201cThere are a lot of traits that are a bit more raw, like the charm, his wits, he doesn\u2019t know how to weaponize it yet. He\u2019s quite reckless, he\u2019s kinda reckless in the movies, but in our game, he\u2019s head on, thinking about the objective, thinking it\u2019s the right thing to do and he\u2019s not following orders. He thinks the right thing justifies a lot of things and M sees a lot of potential him.\u201d\nA big part of it also comes down to relatability for a younger audience, possibly one that may not even be that familiar with the movies as the franchise has slowed down its output in recent years and this may be an entry point to the series for some people.\n\u201cWe wanted to make Bond more relatable, because the audience on consoles, the bulk of it is roughly 25 \u2013 35 and younger, so we felt that to start with the origin story to introduce a new character to people who may know James Bond, but aren\u2019t very close to it,\u201d said Lacaille. \u201cIntroducing the character in his early days makes more sense and of course, it\u2019s a bit more relatable to play a 26 year old if you\u2019re 26.\u201d\nDespite IO Interactive not confirming anything themselves, it\u2019s believed that\nDexter: Original Sin\nactor\nPatrick Gibson is playing James Bond in\n007 First Light\n. They look extremely similar, have the same voices, and so on. However, we will probably get direct confirmation later this year.\nThe post\n007 First Light Developer Reveals Why They\u2019re Telling Bond\u2019s Origin Story\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Exploring James Bond's origin story|Focusing on a younger Bond (26 years old)|Bond's journey to becoming 007|Relatability for a younger audience|Introducing Bond to those unfamiliar with the movies;E:Announcement of Project 007 in 2020|Formal announcement in June with trailer and title reveal|Jonathan Lacaille discussing the game's approach|ComicBook interview with Jonathan Lacaille|Belief that Patrick Gibson is playing James Bond;D:Game releasing next year|Bond is 26 years old in the game|Franchise output has slowed down in recent years|Target audience is roughly 25-35 years old;", "er_digest": "N:Patrick Gibson|Tanner Dedmon|Project 007|Jonathan Lacaille|James Bond;", "gist": "P:Exploring James Bond's origin story|Focusing on a younger Bond (26 years old)|Bond's journey to becoming 007|Relatability for a younger audience|Introducing Bond to those unfamiliar with the movies;E:Announcement of Project 007 in 2020|Formal announcement in June with trailer and title reveal|Jonathan Lacaille discussing the game's approach|ComicBook interview with Jonathan Lacaille|Belief that Patrick Gibson is playing James Bond;D:Game releasing next year|Bond is 26 years old in the game|Franchise output has slowed down in recent years|Target audience is roughly 25-35 years old;N:Patrick Gibson|Tanner Dedmon|Project 007|Jonathan Lacaille|James Bond;", "entities": ["Patrick Gibson", "Tanner Dedmon", "Project 007", "Jonathan Lacaille", "James Bond"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/movies/news/superman-early-screening-amazon-prime-superman-movie-tickets-fandango/", "content": "Truth, justice and the Amazon way?

Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\nScarlett Johansson (\nThe Avengers\n) plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades.\nJoining Zora on the mission are Duncan Kincaid (\nBlade\n\u2018s Mahershala Ali), Zora\u2019s most trusted team member, and paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis (\nWicked\n\u2018s Jonathan Bailey). Pharmaceutical representative Martin Krebs (\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\u2018s Rupert Friend) sends the group to an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park that is inhabited by the worst dinosaurs that were left behind, where they encounter civilian Reuben Delgado (\nThe Lincoln Lawyer\n\u2018s Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and his shipwrecked family.\nTickets are\nnow on sale\nfor\nJurassic

produced the past three WNBA champions, four of the past five MVPs, two signature sneakers, and two of the best stories the league can tell about quickly built local fanbases. They clashed in the WNBA Finals in 2023 and the semifinals in 2024, creating a highlight reel of classic plays.\nYet, as WNBA legend and newly hired Amazon analyst Candace Parker pointed out last week, there\u2019s still not enough of that rivalry on the 2025 WNBA schedule.\nIn an interview on the\nSpolitics\npodcast with Jemele Hill\n, the three-time WNBA champion was asked to pivot from all the negativity toward the league (on its broadcast deal, its oversight of players and fans, or its PR strategy) and name a positive. Parker lauded the league for taking a page from the NBA\u2019s book and \u201creally focusing on the stars.\u201d Beyond the clearly popular rivalry between second-year stars Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, the league has another buzzy head-to-head story for fans to follow between New York and Las Vegas.\nThe league is also, as Parker noted, bringing young stars back to their college campuses for preseason games to bridge the gap between NCAA hoops and the W.\n\u201cNow, in terms of the notoriety and the attention, it\u2019s matching up with what the WNBA needs to do,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIn terms of how you are focusing on the matchups and the rivalries. I say that not just (with) Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, I say that with Breanna Stewart and A\u2019ja Wilson, two of the best to ever play the game of basketball. Focusing on that New York and Aces rivalry, making sure those games are lined up with times that people are going to have eyeballs. For a long time, I felt like the stars came into the league, and then the league kind of diminished the light a little bit.\u201d\nYet even within Parker\u2019s compliment toward the WNBA scheduling staff, we see a missed opportunity.\nParker is correct to note that Liberty-Aces got a marquee opening-weekend slot Saturday on ABC. That game peaked at nearly 2 million viewers, a very solid number\nas the lead-in to another monster clash between Clark and Reese\n.\nBeyond that? New York and Las Vegas don\u2019t play again until July 8 \u2014 a Tuesday. They play just three times all season, with the final matchup coming Aug. 15, a Wednesday-night matchup that starts at 9:30 p.m. ET. Both games are on ESPN.\nThe WNBA managed to schedule the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky to play five times this season. All five games are on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. All five games are on broadcast television: either CBS, ABC or ION.\nThis shouldn\u2019t be difficult. The NFL makes no secret that it prioritized a Tom Brady-Peyton Manning clash in the 2000s and 2010s,\nor that the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills are locked into a late-season duel on CBS\neach fall.\nSunday Night Baseball\nforce-feeds MLB fans Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees games they may not have asked for. We\u2019re most likely going to get LeBron James vs. Steph Curry on Christmas Day until one of them retires.\nYet the WNBA treats Clark-Reese as its only major priority. With just 13 teams playing 40 games apiece across a four-month schedule, the WNBA should be more than able to lean into multiple top rivalries.\nParker is correct that the preseason college campus games and the Clark-Reese scheduling are good signs. Still, it shouldn\u2019t be so hard for a relatively small league with growing revenue and a highly engaged online fan base to push multiple huge stars at once.\nThe post\nCandace Parker praises WNBA for highlighting Liberty-Aces rivalry, but is it doing it enough?\nappeared first on\nAwful Announcing\n.", "ped_digest": "P:WNBA scheduling needs to prioritize multiple top rivalries|Candace Parker praises WNBA for highlighting Liberty-Aces rivalry|League focusing on stars is a positive|Preseason games on college campuses are a good sign|Clark-Reese rivalry is a priority but not the only one;E:WNBA Finals clash between Aces and Liberty in 2023|Semifinals clash between Aces and Liberty in 2024|Interview with Candace Parker on Spolitics podcast|Liberty-Aces game peaked at nearly 2 million viewers|Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky scheduled to play five times this season;D:Liberty-Aces play three times this season|First game on Saturday, ABC|Next game on Tuesday, July 8|Final game on Wednesday, Aug. 15 at 9:30 p.m. ET|Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky play five times|All five games on Friday, Saturday or Sunday|All five games on CBS, ABC or ION;", "er_digest": "N:Angel Reese|Candace Parker|Tom Brady|LeBron James|Steph Curry|Peyton Manning|Caitlin Clark|Breanna Stewart|Jemele Hill;R:Indiana|Las Vegas|Chicago|New York;", "gist": "P:WNBA scheduling needs to prioritize multiple top rivalries|Candace Parker praises WNBA for highlighting Liberty-Aces rivalry|League focusing on stars is a positive|Preseason games on college campuses are a good sign|Clark-Reese rivalry is a priority but not the only one;E:WNBA Finals clash between Aces and Liberty in 2023|Semifinals clash between Aces and Liberty in 2024|Interview with Candace Parker on Spolitics podcast|Liberty-Aces game peaked at nearly 2 million viewers|Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky scheduled to play five times this season;D:Liberty-Aces play three times this season|First game on Saturday, ABC|Next game on Tuesday, July 8|Final game on Wednesday, Aug. 15 at 9:30 p.m. ET|Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky play five times|All five games on Friday, Saturday or Sunday|All five games on CBS, ABC or ION;N:Angel Reese|Candace Parker|Tom Brady|LeBron James|Steph Curry|Peyton Manning|Caitlin Clark|Breanna Stewart|Jemele Hill;R:Indiana|Las Vegas|Chicago|New York;", "entities": ["Angel Reese", "Candace Parker", "Tom Brady", "LeBron James", "Steph Curry", "Peyton Manning", "Caitlin Clark", "Breanna Stewart", "Jemele Hill"], "regions": ["Indiana", "Las Vegas", "Chicago", "New York"]}, {"_id": "https://awfulannouncing.com/nbc/super-bowl-lx-sold-out-commercials.html", "content": "Network TV lives and dies by advertising, and there\u2019s only one real game left in town when it comes to giving ad buyers what they want: Sports.\n75 of the 100 most-watched 2024 primetime telecasts\nwere sports-related\n, and 45 of those were NFL games. At the top of the list was, of course, Super Bowl LVIII, which (\neventually\n) was the most-watched U.S. broadcast ever.\nVariety spoke with four media executives\nwith knowledge of the upfronts marketplace, all of whom confirmed that buyers are bullish on buying ads during sporting events\u2026 and not much else.\n\u201cSports continues to be where the up money is,\u201d one media-buying executive told Variety. \u201cAre the broadcasters being very aggressive in sports?

Much like how fans always appreciated how grounded\nKing of the Hill\nwas when it came to its overarching characters and stories, it seems to be the case for the new series coming to Hulu as well.\nKing of the Hill\u2019\ns new revival will be continuing to tell its grounded stories with each of the characters, and it opens it all up to\nresolving some of the major lingering plots from the original show\n. One of the biggest concerned Nancy\u2019s on and off again affair with John Redcorn, and the final season of the original series seemed to end their torrid relationship once and for all. But as the revival approaches, it seems to tease that their affair has picked up again. Not only that, but it raises big questions of whether or not Dale and Joseph still left in the dark about it all.\nHulu\nIs Nancy Back With John Redcorn in New King of the Hill?\nIn the new\nopening sequence for the\nKing of the Hill\nrevival\n, one of the brief sequences shown happening around Hank and the others sees John Redcorn picking up Nancy. It\u2019s mirroring the sequence that happens between the two of them in the original series so it\u2019s a good callback to the original. But the difference here is that this is after all of the development that Nancy went through in the original series as she decided to end her affair with John Redcorn in order to stay loyal to Dale. The Season 11 episode \u201cHair Today, Gone Today\u201d even sees Nancy making this decision as a sacrifice to her own vanity, which is a huge move for someone like Nancy.\nIf Nancy has indeed returned to her relationship with John Redcorn, it\u2019d be a major disservice to the growth she had in the original series. She opted to naturally lose her hair and stay with Dale because she loved Dale despite his quirks and flaws. He loved her in return, and never really questioned her.\nIt\u2019s why even while someone like Joseph clearly is not his biological son\n, Dale has made many leaps of his own logic to believe that Joseph is indeed his son. Dale just trusts and loves Nancy that much, so it\u2019d be a troublesome backslide if Nancy just reverted to her old ways.\nRELATED:\nKing of the Hill Revival Drops First Look at Surprising Hill Family Return\n20th Television Animation\nDoes Nancy Tell Dale About Joseph?\nBut the bigger question heading into the new\nKing of the Hill\nepisodes is whether or not Nancy has told Dale about Joseph and John Redcorn. The new opening for the series sees Dale continue to hang around with a much older Joseph, so it\u2019s clear that the two of them still share a very close bond as father and son. If she has returned to her affair, then it\u2019s unlikely that Nancy has said anything about the secret in the years since. But that was never really the key issue.\nJohn Redcorn\nwas usually the source of stirring within the relationship\nas his desire to raise Joseph always kept him nearly revealing the connection between him and Nancy. It was much clear to everyone around Dale, but no one was willing to tell the truth because Dale truly loved Joseph as a son. If there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s going to stir the pot even more in the revival it\u2019s John Redcorn, and his role in the new series is still very much unclear. But we\u2019ll see soon enough as\nKing of the Hill\u2019\ns new season debuts with Hulu on August 4th.\nThe post\nKing of the Hill Revival Raises a Big Question About Nancy\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Revival of King of the Hill series after nearly two decades|Nancy Hicks-Gribble's relationship with John Redcorn is a central question|The new series continues the grounded storytelling of the original|Lingering plot points from the original series will be resolved|The revival teases a possible rekindling of Nancy and John Redcorn's affair|Dale's trust and love for Nancy are questioned if she returns to the affair|The series explores whether Nancy has told Dale about Joseph's biological father.|The new season debuts on Hulu on August 4th.E:Original series ended nearly two decades ago|New series set nearly a decade after the original|Nancy ended her affair with John Redcorn in the original series|Opening sequence mirrors the original series' dynamic between Nancy and John Redcorn|Dale and Joseph share a close bond.D:Season 11 episode \"Hair Today, Gone Today\" features Nancy's decision to stay with Dale|August 4th is the debut date for the new season on Hulu.;", "er_digest": "N:Nancy Hicks-Gribble|John Redcorn|Joseph|King of the Hill|Hulu|20th Television Animation|ComicBook.com|Dale;", "gist": "P:Revival of King of the Hill series after nearly two decades|Nancy Hicks-Gribble's relationship with John Redcorn is a central question|The new series continues the grounded storytelling of the original|Lingering plot points from the original series will be resolved|The revival teases a possible rekindling of Nancy and John Redcorn's affair|Dale's trust and love for Nancy are questioned if she returns to the affair|The series explores whether Nancy has told Dale about Joseph's biological father.|The new season debuts on Hulu on August 4th.E:Original series ended nearly two decades ago|New series set nearly a decade after the original|Nancy ended her affair with John Redcorn in the original series|Opening sequence mirrors the original series' dynamic between Nancy and John Redcorn|Dale and Joseph share a close bond.D:Season 11 episode \"Hair Today, Gone Today\" features Nancy's decision to stay with Dale|August 4th is the debut date for the new season on Hulu.N:Nancy Hicks-Gribble|John Redcorn|Joseph|King of the Hill|Hulu|20th Television Animation|ComicBook.com|Dale;", "entities": ["Nancy Hicks-Gribble", "John Redcorn", "Joseph", "King of the Hill", "Hulu", "20th Television Animation", "ComicBook.com", "Dale"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/stargate-atlantis-mysteries-what-happened-aiden-ford-explained-books/", "content": "Who can forget the amazing stories that\nStargate Atlantis\ntold? It was a military sci-fi series, which ironically was in itself a spinoff series from the original\nStargate\nseries. It brought characters and viewers to an entirely new galaxy, complete with different threats and allies. However, the cast was undeniably the heart of this series. John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson), Teyla Emmagan (Rachel Luttrell), Rodney McKay (David Hewlett), and Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) were part of the original expedition team, and while some of their stories lasted through to the end, that isn\u2019t the case for all of them. Elizabeth Weir was killed during the final season, with a few complications along the way. Meanwhile, Aiden\u2019s story is much more complicated, not to mention open-ended.\nAiden Ford had a shocking twist at the end of season 2, and for a moment, it looked like his character wouldn\u2019t survive. While he didn\u2019t die on us, he was infected by Wraith enzymes, forever changing the character fans knew and loved. This started a series of events that couldn\u2019t be undone, including Aiden\u2019s eventual exit from the series. That said, his exit never felt complete, like something was missing from his story. As it turns out, people who have read the novels know exactly what happened to this character.\nRELATED: Prime Video Adds One of the Longest-Running Sci-Fi Franchises (& It\u2019s Not Star Trek)\nThe Downfall of Aiden Ford\nLet\u2019s do a quick refresher course about what happened to Aiden in\nStargate Atlantis\n. Aiden was introduced in episode one of the series, playing the role of a first lieutenant from the US Marine Corps. So it\u2019s safe to say that he was always capable of handling himself. He\u2019s undoubtedly the reason why many characters lived to tell their stories, which is part of why what follows hurts so much.\nAt the end of Season 2, the city of Atlantis was under attack by the Wraith, which is as bad as it sounds. Some Wraith were even able to set foot in the city, putting many of the military personnel into combat scenarios, including Aiden Ford. During the fight, Aiden and a Wraith are thrown out of Atlantis and into the water. It could have spelled the end, given Aiden\u2019s unconscious state. However, the Wraith was still attached to him, resulting in an overdose of Wraith enzymes.\nThis kicks off the infamous series of events, as Aiden portrays stereotypical symptoms of drug addiction, though the drug in question gives him a massive physical boost. He\u2019s able to handle combat with Ronon, to give this one a little context. Aiden appears a few more times after fleeing Atlantis, but was last seen on a Wraith hive ship that later exploded, leaving some fans to believe he died there.\n[RELATED: Over 20 Years Later, This Sci-fi Series Is Still Worth Rewatching]\nAiden\u2019s Journey Continued in the Novels\nIf there\u2019s anything we\u2019ve learned about Aiden Ford, it\u2019s that he is a survivor. Of course, he got off the Wraith ship before it exploded. Here\u2019s where the\nStargate Atlantis\nnovels come into play, as his story continues in\nStargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path\n. Fun fact, it\u2019s the eighth in this set, but there are over 20 others set in the Atlantis universe.\nSo, how does Ford survive the impending Wraith ship\u2019s destruction? It\u2019s pretty simple, really. He got his hands on a Wraith Dart, stole it, and flew away. The only problem is that, unlike some other characters, Ford doesn\u2019t know how to fly Darts, so he ultimately crash-lands. What\u2019s worse is that this left him stranded without access to the Wraith enzyme. So by the time he was rescued by a group of Travelers (more on them in a moment), he was willing to accept their help.\nAs a reminder, the Travelers are a group of humans who survive in the Pegasus galaxy by living on generational spaceships. They\u2019re a hodgepodge collection of ships, but it\u2019s kept them safe. Once one of their doctors helped Aiden survive his withdrawal process, he joined up with their crew, at least for a time. It\u2019s actually a bit more complicated than that, as Ford\u2019s recovery process took about a year, and by the time he was healthy enough to move on his own, the Travelers had no idea where the Atlantis crew went.\nDon\u2019t worry, Ford made a very happy life for himself among the Travelers. He was a useful resource for the group, and they allowed him to continue fighting Wraiths, so it was a win-win. During this time, Ford met his wife, Atelia. He even earned a reputation for himself, among the Travelers and the Wraith, for which he was dubbed \u201cThe Wolf.\u201d This reputation eventually made its way to the Atlantis crew, which began the process of getting Ford back on Earth.\nWhile Ford\u2019s happily ever after never happened in the show, it\u2019s good to know that the writers didn\u2019t forget this character. The novels wrapped his story up in a neat little bow, though some may feel that it was a little too neat. How do you feel about Ford\u2019s ending?\nStargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path\nwas written by Melissa Scott and Jo Graham, and published by Fandemonium Books.\nThe post\nThis Stargate Atlantis Character Disappeared From the Show in Season 3 (Only Readers Know What Happened To Him)\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Military sci-fi series spinoff|Character development|Wraith enzyme infection|Open-ended storyline|Novel continuation;E:Introduction of Aiden Ford|Attack on Atlantis|Aiden and Wraith ejection|Wraith ship explosion|Rescue by Travelers|Marriage to Atelia|Dubbed \"The Wolf\";D:First Lieutenant (US Marine Corps)|Episode one introduction|Season 2 ending|Wraith Dart piloting|Generational spaceships|One year recovery process|Melissa Scott and Jo Graham authors;", "er_digest": "N:Joe Flanigan|Aiden Ford|Rodney McKay|John Sheppard|Rainbow Sun Francks|Elizabeth Weir|Fandemonium Books|Rachel Luttrell|David Hewlett|Torri Higginson|Teyla Emmagan;", "gist": "P:Military sci-fi series spinoff|Character development|Wraith enzyme infection|Open-ended storyline|Novel continuation;E:Introduction of Aiden Ford|Attack on Atlantis|Aiden and Wraith ejection|Wraith ship explosion|Rescue by Travelers|Marriage to Atelia|Dubbed \"The Wolf\";D:First Lieutenant (US Marine Corps)|Episode one introduction|Season 2 ending|Wraith Dart piloting|Generational spaceships|One year recovery process|Melissa Scott and Jo Graham authors;N:Joe Flanigan|Aiden Ford|Rodney McKay|John Sheppard|Rainbow Sun Francks|Elizabeth Weir|Fandemonium Books|Rachel Luttrell|David Hewlett|Torri Higginson|Teyla Emmagan;", "entities": ["Joe Flanigan", "Aiden Ford", "Rodney McKay", "John Sheppard", "Rainbow Sun Francks", "Elizabeth Weir", "Fandemonium Books", "Rachel Luttrell", "David Hewlett", "Torri Higginson", "Teyla Emmagan"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://ctcnews.ca/2025/06/09/canadian-dollar-8-month-high/", "content": "Skip to content\nCanada News\nOntario\nToronto\nBrampton\nVancouver\nSaskatchewan\nCalgary\nMontreal\nWorld\nImmigration\nSports\nHealth\nJobs\nEntertainment\nTech\nCanada News\nOntario\nToronto\nBrampton\nVancouver\nSaskatchewan\nCalgary\nMontreal\nWorld\nImmigration\nSports\nHealth\nJobs\nEntertainment\nTech\nLatest Canada News Top Stories\nCanada News\nCanadian Dollar Rockets to 8-Month High: Decoding the Loonie\u2019s Meteoric Rise\nCanadian dollar soars to 8-month high as BoC holds rates and U.S. dollar weakens.

Onstage at WWDC 2025 on Monday, Apple VP of software engineering Craig Federighi said that the Foundation Models framework will let apps use on-device AI models created by Apple to drive experiences. These models ship as a part of Apple Intelligence, Apple's family of models that power a number of iOS features and capabilities.\n \n\"For example, if you're getting ready for an exam, an app like Kahoot can create a personalized quiz from your notes to make studying more engaging,\" Federighi said. \"And because it happens using on-device models, this happens without cloud API costs [] We couldn't be more excited about how developers can build on Apple intelligence to bring you new experiences that are smart, available when you're offline, and that protect your privacy.\"\n \nIn a blog post, Apple says that the Foundation Models framework has native support for Swift, Apple's programming language for building apps for its various platforms. The company claims developers can access Apple Intelligence models with as few as three lines of code. Guided generation, tool calling, and more are all built into the Foundation Models framework, according to Apple. Automattic is already using the framework in its Day One journaling app, Apple says, while mapping app AllTrails is tapping the framework to recommend different hiking routes.\nRead more of this story\nat Slashdot.", "ped_digest": "P:Apple launches Foundation Models framework for on-device AI|Developers can access Apple Intelligence models with minimal code|Framework supports offline AI capabilities and privacy protection|Automattic's Day One and AllTrails are early adopters;E:Apple announces Foundation Models framework at WWDC 2025|Craig Federighi introduces the framework onstage|Apple releases a blog post detailing the framework|Automattic integrates the framework into Day One|AllTrails utilizes the framework for hiking route recommendations;D:Framework uses as few as three lines of code|Models ship as part of Apple Intelligence;", "er_digest": "N:iOS|Apple|Craig Federighi|Swift;", "gist": "P:Apple launches Foundation Models framework for on-device AI|Developers can access Apple Intelligence models with minimal code|Framework supports offline AI capabilities and privacy protection|Automattic's Day One and AllTrails are early adopters;E:Apple announces Foundation Models framework at WWDC 2025|Craig Federighi introduces the framework onstage|Apple releases a blog post detailing the framework|Automattic integrates the framework into Day One|AllTrails utilizes the framework for hiking route recommendations;D:Framework uses as few as three lines of code|Models ship as part of Apple Intelligence;N:iOS|Apple|Craig Federighi|Swift;", "entities": ["iOS", "Apple", "Craig Federighi", "Swift"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://federalnewsnetwork.com/federal-newscast/2025/06/assessment-finds-67-of-separating-troops-screen-positive-for-mental-health-condition/", "content": "A separation health assessment administered to more than 50,000 service members found that about 67% of troops screened positive for at least one mental health condition. Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were among the most common issues identified. A government watchdog found that over 50% of service members declined referrals to the Defense Department\u2019s inTransition program that provides mental health resources during transition periods. DoD officials told the Government Accountability Office that many factors may contribute to the high rate of positive screenings among separating service members, including that many intend to file disability claims.\n(\nTwo-thirds of service members screen positive for mental health issues during separation\n- Government Accountability Office)\nAhead of the Army's 250th birthday celebration scheduled for Saturday in Washington D.C., the Office of Personnel Management is reminding agencies that they can approve unscheduled or situational telework for employees as preparations ramp up. OPM said starting Wednesday, streets will be blocked off and other safety precautions will get underway causing significant impacts to traffic and commute times. To help alleviate traffic congestion, prevent disruptions to preparation activities, and minimize any distractions to law enforcement and security officials, OPM reminded agencies that they can approve situational/unscheduled telework and other workforce flexibilities, including employee requests to use alternative work schedule day off, annual leave or other authorized time off.\n(\nOPM reminds agencies to give employees flexibilities ahead of Army celebration\n- CHCO Council)\nTwo senators are teaming up on a bipartisan bill that would bring more transparency to the world of security clearances. Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) reintroduced the Integrity in Security Clearance Determinations Act on Thursday. The duo first introduced the bill in 2019. It would establish standards for security clearance decisions and prohibit the executive branch from revoking clearances based on the exercise of constitutional rights. The bill would also codify the rights of employees to appeal decisions to deny or revoke a security clearance.\n(\nWarner and Collins introduce bipartisan legislation to establish transparent standards for security clearances\n- Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.))\nThe Defense Department has promised to deliver its anti-fraud risk strategy by the end of July. The department said it would make data analytics an explicit requirement in that strategy. Seto Bagdoyan from the Government Accountability Office said the department has barely begun integrating data to detect fraud. \u201cBeing at the starting line would be a charitable way to describe it. They\u2019re just not there. The data is massive. They are difficult to work with. We spent months cleaning up the data.\u201d The Pentagon has delayed updating its anti-fraud strategy five times over seven months, from 2017 to 2024. The Defense Department reported that approximately $10.8 billion could be confirmed as fraud.\n(\nDoD to deliver anti-fraud strategy next month\n- Federal News Network)\nThe Supreme Court temporarily lifted a federal court injunction, once again giving the Department of Government Efficiency access to sensitive records at the Social Security Administration. The Supreme Court wrote in an unsigned order that they concluded that, under the present circumstances, SSA give members of the DOGE team access to the agency records in order for those members to do their work. The district court issued the stay on April 17 citing concerns that DOGE's access would likely violate the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n(\nDOGE to have access to SSA records after Supreme Court ruling\n- Supreme Court)\nThe Federal CIO has put a moratorium on meeting with certain types of contractors. Greg Barbaccia, the federal CIO, said his office will no longer meet with research, advisory and strategy consulting firms. Instead, Barbaccia said in an email to the federal CIO community, which Federal News Network obtained, he will only meet with companies that build and deliver actual solutions. He said vendors must speak clearly and directly to how their product or service addresses known problems and what value the government will see in return. Barbaccia did not mandate this change, but shared his thinking with agency CIOs for their consideration.\n(\nFederal CIO wants problem solvers, not problem describers\n- Federal News Network)\nPresident Donald Trump is putting his own stamp on governmentwide cybersecurity policies. Trump on Friday signed a new cybersecurity executive order that keeps in place many Biden administration cyber policies, but with some key changes. Instead of mandating companies attest to meeting secure software development practices, Trump directed the Commerce Department to establish a secure software development consortium. The new order also eliminates language encouraging agencies to accept digital identity documents. And it waters down Biden administration efforts to bolster the security of artificial intelligence systems.\n(\nTrump revokes digital identity actions in new cyber executive order\n- Federal News Network)\nThe Supreme Court has sided with the Department of Government Efficiency in a case dealing with the secrecy of its own records. The court extended a pause on a lower court ruling that would have forced DOGE officials to disclose documents in a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act. A district court had ruled that DOGE is a federal agency subject to FOIA, but the government contends the organization is a White House advisory body, and immune from the public records statute.\n(\nSupreme Court sides with DOGE in a case dealing with the secrecy of its own records.\n- Associated Press)\nThe post\nAssessment finds 67% of separating troops screen positive for mental health condition\nfirst appeared on\nFederal News Network\n.", "ped_digest": "P:67% of separating troops screen positive for mental health conditions|Two-thirds of service members screen positive for mental health issues during separation|Bipartisan bill introduced to increase transparency in security clearances|DoD to deliver anti-fraud strategy next month|Federal CIO puts moratorium on meeting with certain contractors|Trump signs new cybersecurity executive order|Supreme Court sides with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in records secrecy case;E:Separation health assessment administered to over 50,000 service members|Government Accountability Office (GAO) found over 50% of service members declined referrals to inTransition program|Army's 250th birthday celebration scheduled for Saturday in Washington D.C.|Sens.

It\u2019s grainy, actively hostile to the player, and often opaque, making it reminiscent of the days when most horror games only catered to the sickos. It has an undeniable and impeccable style, and the game leans on it pretty hard, but the individual parts that give\nLabyrinth\nan edge also hold it back in pretty severe ways.It is, however, a quilt stitched together from genre greats.\nLabyrinth\n\u2019s Japanese setting evokes the horror-adjacent Onimusha series (which\nstarted\nas a \u201cninja\u201d version of Resident Evil), but its most clear inspiration is\nSilent Hill\n. While there are some Resident Evil nods \u2014 opening doors and going down stairs plays a small cutscene straight out of the first 1996 entry \u2014 it\u2019s mostly based on the first two core installments in Konami\u2019s seminal horror series. Players start out in a foggy forest in the middle of Feudal Japan and gradually make their way into a castle that\u2019s not as it seems. There\u2019s even a grieving woman after the intro, much in the vein of\nSilent Hill 2\n\u2019s Angela.\nEverything is always just a little off.\nRELATED:\nAll Silent Hill Games Ranked From Worst to Best\nA thick blanket of fog and ominous audio make it immediately unsettling, and that feeling only worsens within the harrowing castle walls. Ungodly creatures stalk the halls and often either sprint at the player from the void or hide around corners in an attempt to ambush them. Only a few swipes spell death. Lighting is a precious commodity. The brown, grimy, and pixelated textures only make it harder to see. There is always an uneasy ambience that sounds like the world is screeching or squirming because of the uncomfortable hell that has been thrust upon it. It\u2019s awfully similar to the sound design in\nSilent Hill 2\nin that way, which is an incredibly high compliment.\nThe low poly aesthetic (and more narrow aspect ratio) hides everything behind a layer of fuzz that makes it all a little harder to make out. This is most evident during the short found footage-esque cutscenes because it\u2019s unclear exactly what\u2019s going on. It uses its sound design, quick cuts, awkward angles, and the theater of the mind to create something more frightening. With perfect lighting and framing, it\u2019s probably laughable. With the aforementioned intentional grime, it\u2019s harrowing.\nIts aesthetic similarities to Silent Hill and cultural overlap with Onimusha also, in a broad sense, carry over to its gameplay. In an attempt to earn the first word of its name,\nLabyrinth\nis a first-person dungeon crawler that has players scurrying back and forth to find keys and solve puzzles. It\u2019s a core part of horror games like this, and this ability to stretch more mileage out of a smaller space is something Silent Hill and Resident Evil are known for.\nthis room is a key nexus point for the dungeon and constantly has new enemies.\nHowever, this is where\nLabyrinth\nbegins to crack and demonstrate its worst tendencies. Enemies respawn at an annoying clip and, because of the claustrophobic hallways, mean players almost always have to stop and tediously hack away at whatever bladed rat-like being or creepy crawly that has just wiggled out of hell in the last 30 seconds. Sometimes they even spawn right in front of doors and get a cheap shot in just a second after everything has loaded in, and it\u2019s never a welcome kind of jump scare.\nCombat is purposely laborious, but it goes overboard with its absurdly slow stamina recharge rate. Running out is often a death sentence and forces players to be frugal. But, especially early on, this leads to having to constantly sprint away in order for it to recharge between hits, and it\u2019s almost always tedious. Swordplay doesn\u2019t need to be like\nDevil May Cry\nor even\nBloodborne\nand there\u2019s potential in its simple dodging and parrying, but the barrage of lengthy fights artificially elongate everything and drag the pacing down. It also all feels meaningless when everything resets so rapidly since hard-fought victories are basically undone. Hard-fought victories are often undone within minutes, too, which makes it all feel a little meaningless.\nSometimes, it is just darkness.\nNavigating also has too many pain points, many of which stem from its terrible map. It doesn\u2019t tell players exactly where they are (only the room or hallway they\u2019re in) and doesn\u2019t appropriately differentiate between blocked paths or locked doors. Going to check a room that looks open, only to have to turn back around when that path is blocked, kills the will to explore and often leads to many unnecessary fights.\nA sense of disorientation is appropriate and can heighten the tension if done correctly, but it goes overboard when working against the player this hard. It\u2019s already got relatively obtuse objectives, a persistent unkillable\nMr. X\n-like stalker who ratchets up the tension, and a repetitive environment that is too easy to get lost in, so it doesn\u2019t need to also make getting around even more annoying.\nHorror games like this have to know how to dole out their pain. Not enough drains the atmosphere, but layering it on too thickly makes it overly grueling.\nLabyrinth of the Demon King\nis more or less planted in the latter camp. Searching every corner of a haunted Japanese castle while fending off cursed and sometimes invincible souls can be a rush, yet much of that tension is undercut when it opts to work against the player at every turn with its overturned respawns and abysmal map. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be easier or more soothing. It just would benefit from being slightly less evil.\nThe post\nThis Silent Hill and Onimusha Retro Homage Is Evil in the Best and Worst Ways\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Retro homage to PS1 horror|Evokes Onimusha and Silent Hill|First-person dungeon crawler;E:Release of Labyrinth of the Demon King|Influence from Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Onimusha|Discussion of game's strengths and weaknesses;D:Japanese setting|Feudal Japan|Castle environment|Low poly aesthetic|Narrow aspect ratio|Stamina recharge rate|Respawn rate of enemies;", "er_digest": "N:Silent Hill|Devil May Cry|Mr. X|Resident Evil|Bloodborne|Onimusha;R:Japan;", "gist": "P:Retro homage to PS1 horror|Evokes Onimusha and Silent Hill|First-person dungeon crawler;E:Release of Labyrinth of the Demon King|Influence from Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Onimusha|Discussion of game's strengths and weaknesses;D:Japanese setting|Feudal Japan|Castle environment|Low poly aesthetic|Narrow aspect ratio|Stamina recharge rate|Respawn rate of enemies;N:Silent Hill|Devil May Cry|Mr. X|Resident Evil|Bloodborne|Onimusha;R:Japan;", "entities": ["Silent Hill", "Devil May Cry", "Mr. X", "Resident Evil", "Bloodborne", "Onimusha"], "regions": ["Japan"]}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/mcu-vision-quest-sharon-carter-villain-theory/", "content": "A new theory has appeared online to deal with controversial mystery from Phase 4 of the\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nby introducing a new villain for Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision in his upcoming\nVision Quest\nseries. Vision was last seen in his new white guise flying away from Westview in\nWandaVision\n, and he\u2019s set to make his next appearance in 2026\u2019s\nVision Quest\n. While many members of the spinoff have already been confirmed \u2013 some of whom could be formidable villains \u2013 a new theory suggests that he\u2019s set to face off with another familiar face.\nNew rumors have suggested that\nVision Quest\nmight bring the MCU back to Madripoor, a fictional location first seen in\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n. Madripoor was introduced as the home of Sharon Carter during her time as a fugitive from the United States, so the idea of\nVision Quest\nreturning to Madripoor has informed\na theory shared on Instagram\nthat Sharon Carter\u2019s Power Broker will also return in the upcoming series. Given Carter\u2019s desire to acquire state secrets, prototypes, and weapons to sell to the highest bidder, Vision would clearly be in her sights.\nSharon Carter was first introduced to the MCU\nin\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\nas an agent of SHIELD tasked with watching over Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). She then had a prominent role in\nCaptain America: Civil War\nas a CIA operative tracking down Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), but her actions helping Rogers and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) made her a fugitive. This pushed her into a life of high-end crime as the Power Broker in Phase 4, but her transition into a villain, even after her pardon, caused huge controversy.\nVision Quest\ncan give this evolution meaning.\nVision is perhaps the most powerful sentient weapon ever formed in the MCU, especially after SWORD dismantled him, corrupted his memories, and put him back together as the only machine capable of entering the Scarlet Witch\u2019s Hex and taking on the fabricated Vision. This status would surely make him a target for Sharon Carter as the Power Broker, which could make her a great antagonist for the\nVision Quest\nseries. Four years after\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n, it would be great to see Marvel address this mystery, even though other, more powerful, villains may have already been confirmed.\nRELATED:\nVision Quest Timeline With WandaVision, Agatha Confirmed by Showrunner (& It Makes Sense)\nThe most notable villain already confirmed to be returning in\nVision Quest\nis\nUltron, the tyrannical artificial intelligence\nfirst seen in 2015\u2019s\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n. James Spader is returning to portray the robotic supervillain, while the likes of Jocasta (T\u2019Nia Miller), Todd Stashwick\u2019s assassin, and\nIron Man\u2019s\nRaza (Faran Tahir), a member of the Ten Rings, will also be appearing. These villains may leave little room for Emily VanCamp to return as Sharon Carter, but it would be fantastic to see the Power Broker\u2019s story continue in the MCU, and be given more meaning, explanation, and perhaps redemption.\nDo you want to see Sharon Carter\u2019s Power Broker return in\nVision Quest\n?

These devices will continue to receive security updates for another three years, however.

From patriotic Pearl Harbor to parody Airplane! They are full of action and bring us another perspective to the situations we have maybe heard about before. We have given ourselves some thought and are bringing you the 10 best air force movies of all time.\nTora! Tora! Tora! (1970)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nRelations between Japan and the United States are getting more and more complicated due to the U.S. embargo of raw materials. Air Staff Officer Minoru Genda is planning an attack on the United States. Even though the American intelligence agencies knew about Japanese plans, they didn\u2019t believe that an attack of a kind could happen on U.S. soil.\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is one of the most accurate and interesting retellings of the\nstory of Pearl Harbor, and it brings us the many details that preceded this tragic moment. The movie is full of action, very realistic, and it tells the story as it really happened.\nThe Right Stuff (1983)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThis movie brings us the story of the US space program development, and it covers the breaking of the sound barrier to the Mercury 7 astronauts. It shows us that no one at the time had any idea or knowledge of what they were doing, neither running a space program nor selecting people to participate in it.\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is one of the best 1980s movies, funny and thrilling and definitely a must-watch for everyone interested in space and space programs and traveling. It is full of excellent actors who bring us a story we will adore to watch.\nMemphis Belle (1990)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThe movie is named after a B-17 bomber that got its name from its captain\u2019s girlfriend. It is the story of four officers and six enlisted men on this plane who are about to go on their 25th mission. One of them wants to publicize everything before they even finish it. This becomes a stepping stone among the crew members, who are all completely different and have opposite views on the proposition given.\nRELATED:\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is an interesting true story, and some of the dialogue we see and hear are the ones belonging to the crew on Belle\u2019s mission. Even though the characters are fictional, this educational movie is full of interesting moments.\nSully (2016)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThis biographical drama directed by Clint Eastwood tells the story of pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sulleberger, who was forced to land his damaged plane on the Hudson River to save his crew and his passengers. Although he was mostly considered a hero, there have been many who still considered him reckless for deciding to perform this extremely dangerous action.\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is the type of movie that won\u2019t let you rest until its end. It is realistic, brilliantly played, and directed, and it shows us what pilots are faced with during their flights and how sober and quick they must be if something goes wrong.\nThe Aviator (2004)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThis interesting movie, a biopic about Howard Hughes, centers on his early filmmaking years but even more on his design and promotion of a new aircraft. It is an interesting view of his life, a life full of money and women and accusations of being a war profiteer.\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is not a movie about pilots, but it is still an air force movie due to the importance of Howard Hughes\u2019 revolutionary design in the aircraft industry. It is a great drama directed by Martin Scorsese, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, and Kate Beckinsale in leading roles.\nAir Force One (1997)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nHarrison Ford plays the President of the United States in this intense action crime drama directed by Wolfgang Petersen. He gives an inspiring speech in Moscow about the USA\u2019s new Zero-tolerance policy regarding terrorism. On his flight back home, his plane is hijacked and taken over by a few terrorists who take all the passengers on the Air Force One, including his wife and daughter,\u00a0 hostage.\nTheir plan is to execute one hostage every half hour until their requirements are met. But the President is a former Medal of Honor winner who is unwilling to let everything in their hands.\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is one of the classics among air force movies. Adrenaline-packed, with brilliant performances and claustrophobic enough to make you think twice about getting on an airplane again.\nTop Gun (1986)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThis is the story of\nTop Gun\npilots who want to be the best pilots in the world and are there to obey the rules and learn. We meet Maverick, a young and rebellious pilot whose past and his father\u2019s mysterious death still haunt him, which will have a great impact on him following the rules. He will also learn many important things from a civilian instructor, the ones you don\u2019t hear in the classroom.\nWhy you should watch it:\nAnother absolute classic among air force movies is this action drama directed by Tony Scott and one of\nTom Cruise\u2019s greatest hits\n. It is fun, daring, and interesting, and it became a favorite to many who grew up in the 1980s.\nBlack Hawk Down\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThis brilliant war drama, directed by Ridley Scott, with Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett, and Eric Bana in the leading roles, brings us the events of an almost disastrous mission in Somalia on October 3, 1993. Nearly 100 U.S. Army Rangers were dropped by a helicopter into Mogadishu with the task of capturing two lieutenants of a Somali warlord. This resulted in an extremely violent and dangerous shooting between the Army Rangers, US Special Forces, and Somali gunmen which led to the destruction of two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters.\nRELATED:\n12 Best Patriotic Movies on Disney+ To Stream Right Now\nWhy you should watch it:\nThis is a very realistic story inspired by true events that show us all the problems pilots can encounter while on their missions. It is engaging and thought-provoking and a story you won\u2019t soon forget.\nAirplane! (1980)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nTed Striker is a traumatized World War II pilot who decides to board the plane once again in order to win back the love of his life, flight attendant Elaine Dickinson. When a severe case of poisoning hits everyone on the plane, including the entire crew, Striker will be the one who will have to take charge of everything and safely land the plane.\nWhy you should watch it:\nEven if you are not a big fan of parodies, this movie is a must-see. It is hilarious, very clever, and witty, with excellent performances by Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges, and one of the movies that will make you laugh even more than 40 years after its release.\nPearl Harbor (2001)\nWhat it\u2019s about:\nThis is the story of one of the most infamous World War II moments ever, the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Told through a sentimental and heartbreaking love story, this movie takes us back to the 1940s and shows us the lives of American pilots whose love for their country for sometimes stronger than the love for their closest ones.\nWhy you should watch it:\nIntense, interesting, and full of exciting flying scenes, this is a story of two best friends and a beautiful nurse that will break your heart. You will also learn something through those sad destinies that are probably similar to many at the time.\nReviews\nInterviews\nWrite for Us\nEditorial Policy\nDMCA & Removal Policy\nAffiliate Disclosure\nPress Kit\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms\nOwnership\nSitemap\nDepositphotos", "ped_digest": "P:Top 10 Air Force Movies|Movies explore air force themes|Action, drama, and thrillers are interesting|Movies offer different perspectives|Historical events depicted;E:Release of \"Tora!

While star of the original movie Gerard Butler returns to the franchise to play the live-action Stoic, not all of the cast from the trilogy have returned, seeing new talent take on iconic roles. When it comes to the sequel, however, DeBlois confirmed that he hopes to get Cate Blanchett to reprise her role of Valka, though that offer has yet to be accepted.\nHow to Train Your Dragon\nis set to hit theaters on June 13th.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m wishful as well. It\u2019s still early days,\u201d DeBlois shared with ComicBook at the film\u2019s red carpet premiere. \u201cI think she is\nprobably waiting for a script\n, but I\u2019ve been knocking on that door. I wrote the character of Valka for her, so I told her it\u2019ll always be hers to turn down first.\u201d\nIf a new actor ends up taking on the role from Blanchett, Valka won\u2019t be the only one taking on a slightly different look for the sequel, as the beloved dragon Toothless will also have to mature in their on-screen appearance.\n\u201cWe knew we were going to go there. The idea is that Toothless is roughly Hiccup\u2019s age in sragon years, so he is a juvenile, an adolescent, as well, aging into adulthood,\u201d the filmmaker confirmed. \u201cThat is going to alter his design in subtle ways, but mostly it\u2019s going to alter his mentality because he\u2019s a very sentient dragon. He has his own opinions about everything, and\nhe\u2019ll also start to come into his own\nas a leader of his kind.\u201d\nThe original\nHow to Train Your Dragon\nhas multiple iconic and beloved scenes, which presented DeBlois not only with exciting opportunities, but also some cinematic challenges.

Now, new observations are deepening that intrigue. A\nstudy from the SETI Institute and University of California\n, Davis has documented humpback whales producing large\nbubble rings\nduring friendly interactions with humans\u2014behavior never previously recorded.\nCurious Giants with Strange Behaviors\nHumpback whales\nare known to use\nbubbles as tools\n\u2014to corral prey or assert dominance when competing for a female. But this new behavior, observed during voluntary encounters with boats and swimmers, is different. The whales were not hunting or competing. Instead, they were forming perfectly shaped rings of bubbles directed toward humans, similar to how a smoker might blow smoke rings. Scientists observed this in\n12 separate episodes\ninvolving\n39 rings\nproduced by\n11 individual whales\n.\nAcording to Dr. Laurance Doyle, a SETI Institute scientist and co-author of the paper, This\u201c important assumption is certainly supported by the independent evolution of curious behavior in humpback whales,\u201d. The team believes such interactions can help refine the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence\nby studying intelligence that has evolved independently of\nhumans\nbut still seeks out contact.\nA Mirror Into Non-human Intelligence\nDr. Fred Sharpe, co-lead author and UC Davis affiliate, notes that these whales \u201clive in complex societies, are acoustically diverse, use\nbubble tools\n, and assist other species being harassed by predators.\u201d The newly observed bubble rings could represent a\ncandidate signal\n\u2014a kind of spontaneous interaction aimed at observing a human response or even initiating a primitive exchange.\nDr. Jodi Frediani, another co-lead author and a marine wildlife photographer, added that the team had identified whales from different parts of the world showing this behavior. The majority had\nvoluntarily approached\nhuman swimmers and\nboats\n, displaying apparent\ninquisitiveness and sociability\n. \u201cWe\u2019ve now located a dozen whales from populations around the world\u2026 blowing bubble rings during these episodes of curious behavior,\u201d she said.\nHumpback Whales use a technique called bubble netting which involves encircling schools of prey and blowing a series of bubble rings or vortex rings through the water surround the prey,effectively trapping them into a ball so that they\u2019re easier to capture en masse.\npic.twitter.com/AxzfC85Blx\n\u2014 Domenico (@AvatarDomy)\nMarch 10, 2020\nDecoding the Language of the Sea\nThe project, part of the\nWhaleSETI initiative\n, aims to use insights from nonhuman communication systems to fine-tune how scientists parse signals from space. Studying\naquatic intelligence\noffers a parallel to the challenges of identifying and interpreting\ncosmic signals\n. Dr. Doyle emphasizes that because we lack the tools to recognize entirely alien communication, observing intelligent species on Earth provides valuable analogs.\nThe late Karen Pryor once remarked that \u201cpatterns of bubble production in cetaceans constitute a mode of communication not available to\nterrestrial mammals\n,\u201d a notion now reinforced by this latest research.\nOther contributors to the study include Dr. Josephine Hubbard (UC Davis), Doug Perrine (marine photographer), Simon Hilbourne (Marine Research Facility, Saudi Arabia), Dr. Joy Reidenberg (Icahn School of Medicine), and Dr. Brenda McCowan (UC Davis), who specialize in animal behavior, whale anatomy, and\nAI-assisted decoding of animal communication\n. An earlier paper by the same team, published in\nPeerJ\n, explored bioacoustic playback with an Alaskan humpback whale, suggesting that whales might be capable of\nresponsive interaction\nwith synthetic signals.\nThese observations offer a\nnew perspective on nonhuman intelligence\nand the potential for interspecies communication. By analyzing the social behavior and complex visual signals of humpback whales, researchers are beginning to uncover how forms of intelligence distinct from our own might attempt to initiate contact\u2014both here on Earth and possibly beyond.\nEnjoyed this article?\nSubscribe to our free newsletter\nfor engaging stories, exclusive content, and the latest news.\nFor more news like this, visit\nDailygalaxy.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Humpback whales produce bubble rings during friendly interactions with humans|This behavior was never previously recorded|Bubble rings may be a candidate signal for interspecies communication|The study aims to refine the search for extraterrestrial intelligence|Whales from different parts of the world have been observed displaying this behavior;E:Study documents humpback whales producing bubble rings|Whales voluntarily approach boats and swimmers|Scientists observed 12 separate episodes involving 39 rings|Researchers are analyzing social behavior and visual signals|Earlier paper explored bioacoustic playback with an Alaskan humpback whale;D:12 separate episodes observed|39 rings produced|11 individual whales involved|Whales live in complex societies|WhaleSETI initiative;", "er_digest": "N:Doug Perrine|Karen Pryor|Simon Hilbourne|Marine Research Facility|Dailygalaxy.com|Dr. Laurance Doyle|University of California, Davis|Icahn School of Medicine|SETI Institute;R:Alaska|Saudi Arabia;", "gist": "P:Humpback whales produce bubble rings during friendly interactions with humans|This behavior was never previously recorded|Bubble rings may be a candidate signal for interspecies communication|The study aims to refine the search for extraterrestrial intelligence|Whales from different parts of the world have been observed displaying this behavior;E:Study documents humpback whales producing bubble rings|Whales voluntarily approach boats and swimmers|Scientists observed 12 separate episodes involving 39 rings|Researchers are analyzing social behavior and visual signals|Earlier paper explored bioacoustic playback with an Alaskan humpback whale;D:12 separate episodes observed|39 rings produced|11 individual whales involved|Whales live in complex societies|WhaleSETI initiative;N:Doug Perrine|Karen Pryor|Simon Hilbourne|Marine Research Facility|Dailygalaxy.com|Dr. Laurance Doyle|University of California, Davis|Icahn School of Medicine|SETI Institute;R:Alaska|Saudi Arabia;", "entities": ["Doug Perrine", "Karen Pryor", "Simon Hilbourne", "Marine Research Facility", "Dailygalaxy.com", "Dr. Laurance Doyle", "University of California, Davis", "Icahn School of Medicine", "SETI Institute"], "regions": ["Alaska", "Saudi Arabia"]}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/movies/news/the-matrix-characters-movies-forgot-tank-keymaker/", "content": "The Matrix\nis widely considered a beloved\nfilm franchise\nwith far more hits than misses. The series features a bevy of\nintriguing characters\n, some of whom are around for the long haul and others who seem to up and vanish without a trace. For every core character who returns for multiple installments, there is at least one supporting player who unceremoniously vanishes after serving their primary objective(s). That\u2019s sometimes a natural progression for a storied franchise full of memorable characters. However, that does little to keep us from wondering what happened to some of those characters and why we never heard from them again.\nThinking back on this epic film franchise has us eager to look back on some of the characters who didn\u2019t stick around as long as we wish they had. Keep reading for five characters from\nThe Matrix\nmovies that vanished without a trace.\n1) Tank\nTank (Marcus Chong) is a pivotal character in the first series installment, and he deserves much better than he got. The character doesn\u2019t even receive a proper send-off, not by a long shot. Tank dies (offscreen) at some point between films. After surviving the first, he is conspicuously absent from the second. The muscle-bound character serves as the operator of the\nNebuchadnezzar\n, the hovercraft base station that also serves as an access point to the Matrix for the team of rebels at the picture\u2019s core. He is integral to the team and most agree that he deserves a more intentional ending than what he gets.\nChong ultimately\nfiled suit\nagainst Warner Bros., claiming the studio black balled him, hobbling his career. Following his appearance in\nThe Matrix,\nthe actor\u2019s IMDb credits quickly dwindled, with most of his subsequent showings comprised of TV guest spots and short films. His last completed credit is from 2013, with one short film appearance currently in post-production.\n2) The Keymaker\nThe Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) is an exile program hiding in the Matrix to avoid detection (and deletion). He plays an important role in\nThe Matrix Reloaded\n, in addition to appearing in the video games\nEnter the Matrix\nand\nThe Matrix: Path of Neo\n. His character succumbs to death in\nReloaded\nwhile attempting to bring Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Neo (Keanu Reeves) to the Source. The Keymaker perishes just before they reach the door to the Source. Despite his untimely demise, the character manages to pass the key to the door along to Neo and Morpheus.\nThe Keymaker is a fascinating character with a series of unique abilities that make him memorable to fans following his appearance in\nReloaded\n. Although he fulfills his core mission by getting Morpheus and Neo to the Source, there are still plenty of potential avenues to explore with his character, especially considering that he\u2019s a program and could be brought back to life without a great deal of context required. Case in point: Agent Smith died in\nThe Matrix Revolutions\n, only to return in\nThe Matrix Resurrections\n.\n3) Seraph\nFor anyone who needs a brief refresher, Seraph (Collin Chou) is an advanced sentient exile program designed to protect The Oracle (Gloria Foster in\nThe Matrix\nand\nThe Matrix\nReloaded\nand Mary Alice in\nThe Matrix Revolutions\n). He is first introduced in the second film and features once again in\nthe third.\nLast we hear from Seraph, he is tasked with protecting fellow sentient program Sati (Tanveer K. Atwal). In his efforts, both he and Sati are assimilated by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), meaning that Smith effectively absorbs their powers, taking on the respective abilities of both characters as his own. Fans were understandably bummed when the writers didn\u2019t resuscitate Seraph for the 2021 follow-up\nThe Matrix Resurrections\n. Seraph has established himself as an endearing part of the franchise\u2019s lore and would surely make a welcome addition to any future efforts.\n4) Ghost\nGhost (Anthony Wong) is a recurring character in\nThe Matrix\nseries, a Zion operative who first appears in\nThe Matrix Reloaded\nand subsequently returns for\nThe Matrix Revolutions\n. Fans may remember him as the first mate on the\nLogos\n, a small hovercraft with a tiny core crew.\n[RELATED-\n26 Years Later,\nThe Matrix\nIs Starting to Feel Underappreciated\n]\nWe last hear from Ghost in\nThe Matrix Revolutions\nwhen he joins members of the Zion team in the final showdown against the machines. Many fans hoped to see the character return for the 2021 follow-up\nThe Matrix Resurrections\n, but the filmmakers opted to take the series in a different direction, instead introducing a series of new supporting players.\n5) The Trainman\nThe Trainman features in\nThe Matrix Revolutions\n. He is an exiled program, an antagonist who serves the Merovingian (a malevolent computer program played by Lambert Wilson), and aids programs moving between the machine world and the Matrix.\nTrinity, Morpheus, and Seraph encounter the Trainman at Club Hel where they gain the upper hand on Merovingian. This allows the trio to force the Trainman to take them to Neo. Although there\u2019s not really a definitive answer as to what happens to the character after that, many assume he was likely assimilated by Agent Smith. Despite that, it would have been nice to see him return to fight another day in\nResurrections\n.\nNow that we\u2019ve outlined five characters who vanished without a trace from\nThe Matrix\nfranchise, we\u2019d love to hear your take on who you want to see return. Hit us up in the comments section below.\nAs for the future of the series,\na fifth live-action film is currently in development\n. Stay tuned for more updates on that as we uncover them.\nThe post\n5 Characters The Matrix Movies Just Forgot About\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Beloved film franchise|Intriguing characters|Supporting players|Memorable characters|Sentient exile program|Recurring character|Antagonist;E:Tank's absence from The Matrix Reloaded|Tank's offscreen death|Keymaker's death attempting to reach the Source|Seraph and Sati's assimilation by Agent Smith|Ghost's participation in the final showdown|Trainman's fate after encounter with Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph;D:Marcus Chong filed suit against Warner Bros.|IMDb credits dwindled for Marcus Chong|Last completed credit for Marcus Chong is 2013|Keymaker appears in Enter the Matrix and The Matrix: Path of Neo|Seraph protects The Oracle|Ghost is first mate on the Logos|Trainman aids programs moving between the machine world and the Matrix;", "er_digest": "N:Gloria Foster|Lambert Wilson|Marcus Chong|ComicBook.com|Randall Duk Kim|Collin Chou|Tank;", "gist": "P:Beloved film franchise|Intriguing characters|Supporting players|Memorable characters|Sentient exile program|Recurring character|Antagonist;E:Tank's absence from The Matrix Reloaded|Tank's offscreen death|Keymaker's death attempting to reach the Source|Seraph and Sati's assimilation by Agent Smith|Ghost's participation in the final showdown|Trainman's fate after encounter with Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph;D:Marcus Chong filed suit against Warner Bros.|IMDb credits dwindled for Marcus Chong|Last completed credit for Marcus Chong is 2013|Keymaker appears in Enter the Matrix and The Matrix: Path of Neo|Seraph protects The Oracle|Ghost is first mate on the Logos|Trainman aids programs moving between the machine world and the Matrix;N:Gloria Foster|Lambert Wilson|Marcus Chong|ComicBook.com|Randall Duk Kim|Collin Chou|Tank;", "entities": ["Gloria Foster", "Lambert Wilson", "Marcus Chong", "ComicBook.com", "Randall Duk Kim", "Collin Chou", "Tank"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/anime/news/naruto-itachi-uchiha-akatsuki-birthday/", "content": "The main story of\nNaruto\nmay have been concluded several years ago, but its legacy is still unmatched. Not only is it one of the most popular anime and manga series, but its sequel spin-offs,\nBoruto: Naruto Next Generations\nand\nBoruto: Two Blue Vortex\n, have also been significantly successful. The original series has introduced us to several iconic characters, who are still well-loved by the fandom. Some of these characters are often tragic and complex, especially Itachi Uchiha, who was misunderstood for years. However, when the truth came out, it didn\u2019t take long for him to become\na fan-favorite character\n. June 9th marks the birthday of one of the best characters in Shonen, Itachi Uchiha.\nHis heartbreaking story shatters the conventional norms\nof heroism and replaces it with something deeper, a testament to love layered in complexity and tragedy. Born a prodigy, Itachi had a bright future ahead of him, that is, until Danzo ruined everything he loved in his life.\nThe official account of Viz Media\non X shared an image of the character with the caption, \u201cA big brother.

HBD, Itachi.\u201d While his actions were highly debatable in the beginning, there\u2019s no denying the sacrifices he made for his younger brother, Sasuke Uchiha.\n[\nRELATED:\nNeji Was Right, Naruto Was Destined For Greatness the Whole Time]\nViz Media\nItachi Uchiha Is One of the Most Complex Anti-Heroes in Shonen Anime\nBorn into the prestigious Uchiha clan, Itachi was a prodigy who graduated from the Ninja Academy at the age of seven, awakened his Sharingan by eight, and achieved the rank of Ch\u016bnin at the age of ten. However, despite all his achievements, there was something weighing down on him. His early years were marked by a deep longing for peace, shaped by the horrors witnessed during the Third Great Ninja War. What makes his story truly tragic is the burden he carries as both the protector of Sasuke and the one who killed his entire clan.\nItachi\u2019s undying loyalty towards the village has always been questionable, but he did the best he could to stand by his own ideals and find even a small chance to keep his brother safe. He died sick and in front of his brother after shouldering the weight of his guilt and the world\u2019s hatred for several years.

It contains all the articles I published that week, as well as an additional essay that has been not been published elsewhere yet. This is a republication of last week\u2019s essay I send out, slightly modified and expanded. If you\u2019re interested, subscribe below to get all the updates directly in your inbox every week!\nWhen we talk about emerging technologies, especially social networks, we tend to seek clear definitions and boundaries. The question \u2018what is the fediverse?\u2019 quickly becomes \u2018which platforms belong and which don\u2019t?\u2019 It indicates that definitions of terms like \u2018Open Social Web\u2019 and \u2018fediverse\u2019 are by their very nature\ncontested\n. This theme, that the definition of what the open social web is continually contested, is of the core ideas behind a presentation I gave last week during FediForum. When the organisers asked me to host a session on \u2018What\u2019s New in the Open Social Web\u2019 for newcomers to the space, I initially considered taking a straightforward approach, talking about software, and cool news apps people have been building. But I think that would have missed the trees for the forest. For people who want to get up to speed on what\u2019s been happening in the space of the Open Social Web in the last half year or so, it seems much more helpful to understand how ideas about this space have evolved. The software and apps do not exist in a vacuum, but are built as a response to how people view the Open Social Web.\nTo understand the open social web, the fediverse, the ATmosphere and the entire cluster of loosely related open protocols, platforms and software, I think the best way is to see it as a set of contested ideas. The large majority of people who are involved in this \u201cthing\u201d of the open social web have some shared idea about that open protocols and open social networks are important. But once you zoom in a little bit more, it is easy to see that there are a wide set of diverging opinions on what the open social web is, what is included, and how it should work. Furthermore, these different opinions are not static, but change over time. A clear example of this is what\nI recently wrote\nabout the concept of decentralisation, and how people\u2019s viewpoints on this have shifted recently.\nBut the open social web is not just purely vibes and opinions, it is also shaped by technology and software. Technology sets the boundaries within opinions can be contested. Sometimes, technology comes along that changes what\u2019s possible, and expands the understanding of what the open social web is.\u00a0Bounce is a great example, of how a new technology changes and expands the contested boundaries of what the Open Social Web is\nBounce is a newly announced tool by A New Social, the organisation behind Bridgy Fed, which allows people to move accounts across different networks and protocols. With Bounce, people can move their social network graph from Bluesky to ActivityPub platforms like Mastodon and Pixelfed. This represents a significant technological development that was not possible before, as Bluesky uses a different protocol. For more information on how Bounce works, check out\nA New Social\u2019s blog post\n.\nBounce is one of those tools that is meaningful not only for the technical capabilities, but also for how it changes what people understand the space of the open social web to be. Up until now, the fediverse and the ATmosphere were two different places, only partially connected via Bridgy Fed. With the ability to transfer a social graph across different protocols, these two separate places move much closer together.\nOne interesting property of a tool like Bounce is that it the existence of the tool matters more than people actually using the tool. A major part of building healthier social platforms is the ability to have a \u201ccredible exit\u201d. That means that people can leave the platform if they want to, and take the valuable parts (their social graph and their data) with them. Bounce expands the ability to have a credible exit from Bluesky. One challenge that Bluesky PBC faces is that they\u2019ve build the AT Protocol to give their users a credible exit to other apps using the protocol, but these hypothetical other apps are slow to emerge. Now users do have the possibility for a credible exit to another protocol, where there are multiple other communities and platforms to choose from.\nWhat makes this space of the open social web, the fediverse and the ATmosphere so interesting to me is how it is continually changing and evolving. And with the ability to move your social graph between protocols, how we can understand this space has changed yet again. This is why I framed my update on Whats New on the Open Social Web in terms of contested and evolving ideas. The most significant developments in this space are not always new software or apps, they are also shifts in how we think about what these networks are and how they operate. Bounce is an example of both: it presents a new technology, the ability to transfer a social graph across protocols, but it also changes how people understand the ATmosphere and fediverse to be two separate places. Choosing a platform is becoming less of a permanent choice, as the social graph you build becomes more portable. Tools like Bounce suggest the direction of the Open Social Web is less about specific protocols, and more about expanding user agency.", "ped_digest": "P:Open Social Web definitions are contested|Importance of understanding evolving ideas over just new software|Bounce tool expands understanding of Open Social Web|Credible exit is key to healthier platforms|User agency is expanding in the Open Social Web;E:Presentation at FediForum on Open Social Web|Announcement of Bounce tool by A New Social|Bluesky users can now move accounts to ActivityPub platforms|Bridgy Fed previously connected fediverse and ATmosphere|Shift in viewpoints on decentralization;D:Bounce allows social graph transfer from Bluesky to Mastodon/Pixelfed|Bluesky uses a different protocol than ActivityPub|ATmosphere and fediverse were previously only partially connected|Bounce is a tool by A New Social;", "er_digest": "N:Pixelfed|Fediverse|Bounce|Bluesky|ATmosphere|Mastodon;", "gist": "P:Open Social Web definitions are contested|Importance of understanding evolving ideas over just new software|Bounce tool expands understanding of Open Social Web|Credible exit is key to healthier platforms|User agency is expanding in the Open Social Web;E:Presentation at FediForum on Open Social Web|Announcement of Bounce tool by A New Social|Bluesky users can now move accounts to ActivityPub platforms|Bridgy Fed previously connected fediverse and ATmosphere|Shift in viewpoints on decentralization;D:Bounce allows social graph transfer from Bluesky to Mastodon/Pixelfed|Bluesky uses a different protocol than ActivityPub|ATmosphere and fediverse were previously only partially connected|Bounce is a tool by A New Social;N:Pixelfed|Fediverse|Bounce|Bluesky|ATmosphere|Mastodon;", "entities": ["Pixelfed", "Fediverse", "Bounce", "Bluesky", "ATmosphere", "Mastodon"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://americanbazaaronline.com/2025/06/09/ai-unicorn-builder-ai-collapses-in-1-5-billion-bust-463503/", "content": "By Soumoshree Mukherjee\nOnce celebrated as a $1.5 billion AI unicorn, Builder.ai has now become a cautionary tale in the tech industry, filing for insolvency amid widespread allegations of fraud and misrepresentation.\nThe London-based startup, launched in 2016 by Sachin Dev Duggal, positioned itself as a no-code app development platform powered by artificial intelligence. With backing from Microsoft, SoftBank\u2019s DeepCore, IFC, and the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Builder.ai marketed its flagship AI assistant, Natasha, as a revolutionary tool for automating software development with minimal human effort.\nHowever, as reported by\nBloomberg,\nthe company\u2019s image began to unravel when insiders and whistleblowers revealed that the platform\u2019s so-called AI functionality was largely non-existent.\nREAD: Regulating AI: Sanjay Puri on policy, challenges, and ethical innovation\n(November 1, 2024)\nInstead of AI, the platform relied on a workforce of approximately 700 engineers in India who manually built applications while the company maintained the illusion of automation. Linas Beli\u016bnas, director at Zero Hash, publicly exposed the discrepancy, stating in a viral LinkedIn post: \u201cIt turns out the company had no AI and instead was just a group of Indian developers pretending to write code as AI.\u201d\nConcerns over Builder.ai\u2019s claims had been circulating for years. As early as 2019,\nThe Wall Street Journal\nreported that the company\u2019s AI functionality appeared overstated. These doubts resurfaced with force in 2024, as internal audits and whistleblower reports revealed inflated revenue figures and financial misconduct.\nOne significant red flag involved a \u201cround-tripping\u201d scheme with Indian social media company VerSe Innovation (Dailyhunt\u2019s parent firm), where both firms allegedly invoiced each other for similar amounts without actual exchange of services.\nBloomberg\nconfirmed that these transactions were used to mislead investors about the company\u2019s financial health.\nVerSe\u2019s Co-Founder Umang Bedi denied the allegations, calling them \u201cabsolutely baseless and false,\u201d asserting that his company never engaged in deceptive accounting practices. Builder.ai, however, declined to comment.\nREAD: China accelerates brain chip development as Beinao No.1 leads human trials\n(April 2, 2025)\nThe company\u2019s unraveling accelerated when Viola Credit, which had extended a $50 million loan in 2023, seized $37 million from Builder.ai\u2019s accounts earlier this year, leaving only $5 million in restricted funds. This crippled its ability to operate across key markets including the UK, U.S., UAE, Singapore, and India.\nFounder and CEO Duggal subsequently resigned and is now under investigation in India for alleged money laundering. His replacement, Manpreet Ratia, confirmed to\nBloomberg\nthat the company had laid off its entire workforce and is now undergoing insolvency proceedings.\nBuilder.ai\u2019s downfall not only wiped out QIA\u2019s $250 million investment but also underscores a broader reckoning in the AI startup ecosystem.

read\nIn This Article:\nNVDA\nAMD\nINTC\nNvidia (\nNVDA\n,\nFinancials\n)\ncaptured a dominant 92% share\nof the add-in-board GPU market in the first quarter of 2025, extending its lead over rivals Advanced Micro Devices (\nAMD\n,\nFinancials\n) and Intel (\nINTC\n,\nFinancials\n), according to Jon Peddie Research.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nRevenue and shipment figures from the PC GPU market show Nvidia expanded its AIB market share by 8.5 percentage points quarter over quarter, while AMD dropped 7.3 percentage points to 8%. Intel fell to 0% after a 1.2-point decline. The total AIB market shipped 9.2 million units in Q1.\nThe companys growth was driven by the launch of its RTX 50 series GPUs, while AMDs RDNA 4 launch came later in the quarter. Intels Battlemage B-series failed to move the needle, per the data. In the overall PC GPU spaceincluding integrated graphicsNvidia also gained 3.6 percentage points, outperforming AMD and Intel, who posted respective declines of 1.6 and 2.1 points.\nDemand from gamers remains concentrated on the RTX 3060 and 4060, according to Steams May 2025 hardware survey, though the new 5060 Ti has started to appear with a 0.21% share.\nThe strength in discrete GPUs contrasts with a broader slowdown in the desktop CPU market, which shrank by 14.5% year over year and 20.6% quarter over quarter. However, data center GPU shipments rose 9.6%, reflecting ongoing AI-driven demand.\nThe discrete GPU market is expected to face a -10.3% CAGR through 2028, with Jon Peddie Research projecting an installed base of 130 million units by the end of the forecast period. By 2028, PC GPUs are expected to total 2.8 billion units, with dedicated GPUs reaching 15% penetration.\nThis article first appeared on\nGuruFocus\n.\nStorie consigliate", "ped_digest": "P:Nvidia dominates GPU market share|AI demand drives data center growth|Desktop CPU market slows|RTX 50 series boosts Nvidia|AMD and Intel lose market share;E:Q1 2025 GPU market share report released|RTX 50 series launch|AMD RDNA 4 launch|Intel Battlemage B-series underperforms|Steams May 2025 hardware survey reveals gaming trends;D:92% GPU market share for Nvidia|8% GPU market share for AMD|0% GPU market share for Intel|9.2 million units shipped in Q1|RTX 3060 and 4060 remain popular among gamers|5060 Ti gains 0.21% share|14.5% year-over-year decline in desktop CPU market|20.6% quarter-over-quarter decline in desktop CPU market|9.6% rise in data center GPU shipments|130 million units projected installed base by 2028|2.8 billion total PC GPUs by 2028|15% dedicated GPU penetration by 2028|US;", "er_digest": "N:AMD|Nvidia|NVDA|Intel|Advanced Micro Devices|Faizan Farooque;R:US;", "gist": "P:Nvidia dominates GPU market share|AI demand drives data center growth|Desktop CPU market slows|RTX 50 series boosts Nvidia|AMD and Intel lose market share;E:Q1 2025 GPU market share report released|RTX 50 series launch|AMD RDNA 4 launch|Intel Battlemage B-series underperforms|Steams May 2025 hardware survey reveals gaming trends;D:92% GPU market share for Nvidia|8% GPU market share for AMD|0% GPU market share for Intel|9.2 million units shipped in Q1|RTX 3060 and 4060 remain popular among gamers|5060 Ti gains 0.21% share|14.5% year-over-year decline in desktop CPU market|20.6% quarter-over-quarter decline in desktop CPU market|9.6% rise in data center GPU shipments|130 million units projected installed base by 2028|2.8 billion total PC GPUs by 2028|15% dedicated GPU penetration by 2028|US;N:AMD|Nvidia|NVDA|Intel|Advanced Micro Devices|Faizan Farooque;R:US;", "entities": ["AMD", "Nvidia", "NVDA", "Intel", "Advanced Micro Devices", "Faizan Farooque"], "regions": ["US"]}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/league-of-legends-riftbound-tcg-how-to-play/", "content": "Enter\nRiftbound\n, the League of Legends trading card game, where player choice takes center stage. This mobility-focused game for 2-4 players emphasizes strategic gameplay, allowing players to explore a variety of tactics. The first set, Origins, introduces a diverse array of champions, each designed to appeal to different play styles. Whether players are looking for a competitive edge or a more casual experience, Origins serves as a foundational set that offers ample opportunity for exploration and experimentation.\nIn\nRiftbound\n, strategy is at the forefront. The game is not centered around flashy, singular cards that dominate decks. Instead, players are encouraged to build around a champion using various approaches. To construct a deck, all that is required is a Legend and a corresponding Champion of the same color combination, enabling players to tailor their strategies in unique ways. This flexibility fosters a rich gameplay environment where multiple paths to victory can be explored, ensuring that each game feels fresh and engaging.\nBelow, we\u2019re giving you a rundown on how to play, how to score points, and deckbuilding for\nRiftbound\n.\nHow To Play\nFirst off, shuffle your Rune and Main deck, ensuring a Champion and Legend card are face up and above your deck in the Legend and Champion Zone. Each player will now place their chosen Battlefields aside, and then the players will shuffle their decks. Be sure to keep your Main deck (blue) and Rune Deck (white) separate, and then place them into their zones.\nAfter shuffling, determine who will go first and draw 4 cards from your main deck. In turn order, the players can perform a mulligan. This is where a player may choose two cards in their hand and recycle them for two new cards. Now, let the game begin!\n[\nRELATED:\nEverything to Know About Riftbound, the League of Legends TCG, After Going Hands-On\n]\nIn order to play cards, you need to understand that cards usually have two costs: the Energy cost, which is the big number in the top left circle. This number tells you how many Runes you need to have ready in play to Exhaust (turn sideways) to play the card. The second cost is the Power cost, which has a colored symbol beneath the Energy cost. Playing this requires a specific color Rune to be recycled or put under your Rune Deck. For example, playing Viktor is a 4 Energy cost, two of which need to be yellow Runes. Once those four cards are turned sideways, put two yellow Runes back at the bottom of your Rune Deck. Not all cards have a Power cost.\nOnce you play a Unit, it goes into your Base with the Exhausted effect. When a Unit is under this effect, it cannot do anything.\nThe Phases\nEvery turn, players will utilize the A, B, C, and D phases:\nA\n:\nAwaken:\nThe Turn Player readies all your cards, turning them into their play position, including Runes.\nB: Beginning:\nIf you are Holding a Battlefield, score a point.\nC\n:\nChanneling:\nChannel (Draw) 2 runes from the Rune Deck.\nD\n:\nDraw:\nDraw 1 card from your main deck. Then perform any actions during this time.\nOnce Units are ready, decide on a Battlefield you wish to conquer. Exhaust the Unit by turning it sideways. If you reach a Battlefield and no enemy Units are there, you conquer it (Boom! You scored a point!). Use the tracker on the left of your playmat to keep track of points. If you move a Unit to an occupied Battlefield, a Showdown will commence.\nLooking at the number on the top right of your Unit card, you will see a sword and shield symbol followed by the number that represents your offense and defense. This number states how much you deal and how much damage your Unit can take. In the case of a Showdown, the bigger number will win. Losing Units will die and go to the Trash, beneath your Main deck. For example, if two three-might Unit cards went up against a five, the two three-might cards would win, because their six is bigger than the five. But one of the three would die in the process. After the Showdown, Units recover to full health. Damage does not carry over through turns.\nIn addition to conquering bases, Unit cards can be moved together to conquer Battlefields, but cannot simultaneously move to different Battlefields.\u00a0 After Holding a Battlefield, additional Units can be placed there to make your army stronger for a collective Might power.\nSpells are one-shot effects and are indicated on the card as \u201cSpell\u201d and will not have a Might score. Spells are instant cards that do their effect and then are moved to the Trash. There is a variety of different effects for a Spell card. Some can do damage, buff units, or draw cards. Additionally, spells are played first before Showdowns.\nEach Champion has a special Signature Spell that only they can play. For example, Siphon Power can only be used in a Viktor deck.\nKeywords\nSimilar to other popular TCGs,\nRiftbound\nhas important keywords that keep the game moving. Here are a few to understand:\nBurning Out:\nWhen a player runs out of cards in their deck, they must perform a Burning Out action. The player must shuffle their Trash into their main deck, then choose an opponent to gain 1 point.\nExample: A player attempts to draw 1 during their Draw Phase while their Main Deck is empty. That player instead shuffles their trash into their Main Deck, chooses an opponent to gain 1 point, and then draws 1. [Riftbound Core Rules v1.0]\nChannel:\nDrawing cards. For example, \u201cChannel 2 Runes\u201d would mean to draw 2 more rune cards.\nConquer\n: Taking a battlefield (1+ point)\nExhaust:\nTurning the card to the right. In this state, it cannot be used.\nGanking:\nAn ability that lets a Unit go from one battlefield to another battlefield.\nHolding:\nSecuring a Battlefield for an entire round (1+ point).\nRecycle:\nPlacing a card at the bottom of the deck.\nRunes:\nSimilar to energy, they are necessary to play cards.\nSeals:\nA Gear card that creates a Rune that cannot be recycled. No cost but you have to recycle a Rune in order to put it into your Base.\nScoring Points\nThe first player to 8 points wins the game, and there are two ways to get points.\nConquer:\nPlayers gain a point each time they conquer a battlefield (either by securing an empty battlefield or by winning a Showdown and taking it over).\nHold:\nThe second way to score a point can be earned by Holding a Battlefield. This means you remain there until their next turn. In some situations, you may be able to conquer more than one base! Earn 1 point for every base you conquer.\nNow, scoring points might seem like a breeze, but there is a 7-point cap. How to get the last point and win is where the real tension gets real. In order to score that last point, a player must take ALL Battlefields. For example, if a player is already holding 1 Battlefield, they must conquer the other(s).\nA player may only score points for either method once per Battlefield per turn. A game of\nRiftbound\ncontinues until one player wins!\nDeckbuilding\nOrigins introduces a new framework for gameplay, featuring a two-color Legend card, a two-color Signature Spell, and two one-color Champion Units in each deck. This setup provides players with a solid base to effectively showcase their champion.\nAs the cornerstone of the game, Origins also lays the groundwork for a fresh competitive metagame. The set includes several essential cards to help new players get started, including six Seal cards designed to enhance the resource system\u2019s effectiveness.\nThe battlefields in Origins offer diverse strategic choices, enabling players to boost their powerful units, enhance mobility, or significantly influence showdown combat. Every battlefield is classified as uncommon, ensuring they are accessible to all players.\nWith all this in mind, here are the basic steps to make a main deck of at least 40 cards that will consist of 1 Chosen Champion unit, units, gear, and spells.\nPick a Legend. This will define the two colors of your deck.\nPick a chosen Champion unit. Make sure that your Champion unit matches the Legend. For example, a Yasuo needs to be matched with another Yasuo.\nChoose 39 main deck cards. The chosen Champion unit you selected in step 2 is your 40th card.\nBe sure to select deck cards that are within your Legend\u2019s colors.\nInclude your Legend\u2019s Signature Spell\nYou can include up to 3 copies of any card. This goes for the chosen Champion unit, too.\nBuild a 12-card Rune deck. It is a good idea to have a split of the two basic runes of your Champion colors.\nChoose 3 Battlefields.\nFor more information on the rules, terms, and cards, check out the League of Legends\u2019 Riftbound website\nhere\n. Now that you are equipped with your selected champion, you\u2019re prepared to unleash them in combat.\nThe post\nHow to Play the New League of Legends TCG, Riftbound\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Riftbound is a League of Legends trading card game|Player choice is central to gameplay|The Origins set introduces diverse champions|Strategy is emphasized over single powerful cards|Players tailor strategies with Legends and Champions|Flexibility fosters a rich gameplay environment;E:Players shuffle Rune and Main decks|Players place Battlefields aside|Players perform a mulligan|Players draw cards|Units go into the Base with the Exhausted effect|Players utilize A, B, C, and D phases|Showdowns commence when Units occupy the same Battlefield|Units recover to full health after Showdowns|Players conquer Battlefields|Spells are one-shot effects|Players must perform a Burning Out action when their deck is empty;D:Game supports 2-4 players|First player to 8 points wins|Players gain 1 point for conquering a battlefield|Players gain 1 point for Holding a Battlefield|There is a 7-point cap|Players must conquer all Battlefields to score the last point|Origins set includes six Seal cards|Each deck requires a Legend card|Each deck requires a Signature Spell|Decks must consist of at least 40 cards|Rune decks consist of 12 cards|League of Legends (Organization)|Viktor (Person)|Yasuo (Person)|ComicBook.com (Company);", "er_digest": "N:ComicBook.com|Yasuo|Viktor|Riftbound;", "gist": "P:Riftbound is a League of Legends trading card game|Player choice is central to gameplay|The Origins set introduces diverse champions|Strategy is emphasized over single powerful cards|Players tailor strategies with Legends and Champions|Flexibility fosters a rich gameplay environment;E:Players shuffle Rune and Main decks|Players place Battlefields aside|Players perform a mulligan|Players draw cards|Units go into the Base with the Exhausted effect|Players utilize A, B, C, and D phases|Showdowns commence when Units occupy the same Battlefield|Units recover to full health after Showdowns|Players conquer Battlefields|Spells are one-shot effects|Players must perform a Burning Out action when their deck is empty;D:Game supports 2-4 players|First player to 8 points wins|Players gain 1 point for conquering a battlefield|Players gain 1 point for Holding a Battlefield|There is a 7-point cap|Players must conquer all Battlefields to score the last point|Origins set includes six Seal cards|Each deck requires a Legend card|Each deck requires a Signature Spell|Decks must consist of at least 40 cards|Rune decks consist of 12 cards|League of Legends (Organization)|Viktor (Person)|Yasuo (Person)|ComicBook.com (Company);N:ComicBook.com|Yasuo|Viktor|Riftbound;", "entities": ["ComicBook.com", "Yasuo", "Viktor", "Riftbound"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://abc17news.com/weather/2025/06/09/tracking-gradually-warming-temperatures-before-rain-returns-late-week/", "content": "TONIGHT: Mostly clear and comfortable with lows in the upper 50s.\nTOMORROW: Sunny with light winds and highs in the lower 80s.\nEXTENDED: As upper high pressure builds in over the next few days, we can expect sunshine and nearly calm winds as temperatures begin to gradually warm back up into the lower 80s.

With the original animated films being an adaptation of a book series, those movies were adaptations in their own right, while this new film continues the legacy of the fan-favorite books. Many of these adaptations bring in new creative leadership to helm such projects, though one thing that makes the new\nHow to Train Your Dragon\nso interesting is that Dean DeBlois, who directed the original trilogy, also directed this live-action experience. The new\nHow to Train Your Dragon\nhits theaters on June 13th.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the spirit of [Cressida Cowell\u2019s] book that comes through,\u201d DeBlois shared with ComicBook about continuing the franchise\u2019s journey. \u201cWhen Chris Sanders and I came onto that first film, we were invited to\nbring our own story to the mix\n, keep the essence of the characters, but make make it broader and more expansive, and that just caused the story to head in its own direction, but people who love the movies go to read the books and people who\u2019ve read the books come to watch the movies. I think it\u2019s this cross-pollination that works.\u201d\nDeBlois isn\u2019t the only original filmmaker returning for the live-action adapation, as John Powell returns to this world to craft the live-action score.\n\u201cHe called me very early and I had to prod him into it a little bit. He was a bit nervous and I just said to him that I remember that the first film was incredibly cinematic,\u201d Powell expressed of reuniting with DeBlois. \u201cIt felt like if you\u2019d been able to make it live action, you would, so why not do that? Just go with that feeling. He really did. He really, really did. He was\nvery respectful for that original audience\n, but this is really, I think, almost what he was wanting to make.\u201d\nAs far as how scoring the live-action experience compared to scoring the animated films, Powell detailed, \u201cThis is a very different view on that score from when you were making it the\u00a0first time. When you\u2019re making it the first time,\u00a0you have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0You don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work.\u00a0You\u2019re just trying\u00a0to piece it all together.\u00a0You\u2019re going from zero to something.\u00a0This time, we go from something that exists to a different version of it\u00a0that needs to respect two audiences:\u00a0the audience that liked it 15 years ago and loves animation and the audience\u00a0that has never seen it.\u00a0So it\u2019s a real duality.\u00a0You have to make the score work for both of those groups of people.\u00a0You mustn\u2019t\u00a0disappoint the people who are waiting for things,\u00a0but you also need to make it work as well as it possibly can fit\u00a0in a way that is deeply emotionally consistent with what\u00a0is happening on screen or on the level of the story.\u00a0Not necessarily just what you\u2019re seeing,\u00a0but the level of the characters.\u00a0Understanding the characters\u2019 feelings at the time,\u00a0and then where the audience is\u00a0on that\ntimeline of understanding the story\n.\u00a0It proved to be much harder than I expected.\u201d\nEven though the live-action film has some familiar faces making their returns, a new ensemble of talent allowed this new movie to expand on things previously unexplored or put new twists on familiar territory.\n\u201cSpeaking to Dean, I think it was definitely something to highlight, the reasoning behind all of her actions and her behavior and why she is the way she is. Why is she so ambitious? Why is she so strong? Why is she so determined?\u201d actor Nico Parker pointed out about playing Astrid. \u201cThat felt like stuff that we really wanted to highlight and I feel like we did a pretty good job of it. I literally would have played a tree in this movie if they had wanted me to, so the fact that we even got to expand a bit on the character is beyond any of my wildest dreams.\u201d\nGabriel Howell, who takes on the role of Snoutlout in the live-action movie, admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s intimidating because I\u2019m a huge fan of Jonah Hill anyway. Growing up, him being him, and he\u2019s so funny in the animation and I think because they could just riff in the recording booth, they\u2019ve just got absolute gold, and that\u2019s perfect. So getting anywhere, or attempting to get near that, would be fruitless. Love Jonah, love the part, love the world, how can I nestle in there as me, and my heart, and my soul?\u201d\nJulian Dennsion takes on Fishlegs in the new adaptation and thinks all of his preparation will stick with him, revealing, \u201cI think Fishlegs has this ADHD. He\u2019s obsessive over everything about dragons. I think it\u2019s a lot in my head. I still have the cards at home. I was able to take some home. And also I loved the riders of Berk. You see a lot more of the lore and Fishlegs learning about things. It\u2019s still in there, it\u2019s stuck to my brain. Hopefully when we do more, it stays there\nso I can scrape it off again\nand use it.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s lots of visual effects required to bring the movie to life, the live-action perspective did mean the cast got to immerse themselves in this fantastical world a bit more authentically.\n\u201cToothless was an incredible feat of mechanics. I think he had a few more moving parts than the rest of us. Jealous,\u201d Howell shared. \u201cI think Julian had it tough, because he\u2019s so squat, so his legs were up, whereas Hookfang has a bit of space, so I could \u2026 I was strapped in, but I could I could relax, and so I think I had it easy. Cons would be you can\u2019t really get down. If you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I need a wee,\u2019 or something, they\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s gonna be 25 minutes.\u2019 Once you\u2019re up there, you\u2019re up there.\u201d\nRuth Codd, who plays Phlegma the Fierce, expressed, \u201cThey built a whole set, like they built the whole arena, they built the whole Berk, so it was pretty hard not to be immersed in it. You\u2019re dressed up as a Viking, my leg was in the shape of a dagger, so it was pretty, pretty easy to get into character.\u201d\nWhile Nick Frost wasn\u2019t in the original movies, he\u2019s well versed in bringing to life a variety of characters, with the experience of being surrounded by younger performers\noffering him interesting opportunities\n.\n\u201cThe younger cast, they\u2019re not that young, even though we call them the trainees and often we refer to them as the kids,\u201d the actor joked. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I think they\u2019re in their 30s. But to me, when you\u2019re 53, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re our kids.\u2019 But in terms of Mason [Thames], I find myself being quite protective to him all the time because I have children who aren\u2019t much younger than Mason. So I\u2019m like, \u2018You all right? Do you want a drink?\u2019 I\u2019m quite fatherly to him. It\u2019s a big deal for him, I know he\u2019d done\nBlack Phone\nand other little bits and pieces, but this is just an entirely different animal. If he can learn something in terms \u2014 I\u2019d never want to teach. I always find, because someone\u2019s younger than you, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a better actor just because you\u2019re older, that\u2019s just nuts, but in terms of, \u2018Okay, so Nick turns up on time every day, he knows everyone\u2019s name, he stays to the end, he does lines off camera.\u2019 That\u2019s what you can teach.\u201d\nHow to Train Your Dragon\nhits theaters on June 13th.\nAre you looking forward to the new movie?

ML classifiers address many legacy challenges through their abilities to capture the complex statistical profiles across diversified flow types \u2014profiles that are difficult to extract manually as simple \u2018if-else\u2019 signatures. However, ML-based classifiers often require many time-series packets from each flow to construct a statistical profile for accurate classification \u2014 not cost-effective when handling millions of concurrent flows in a large network and can cause delays for subsequent network operations (NetOps) tasks.\nIn this post, I discuss FastFlow, our recent effort to enable ML classifiers to use just sufficient (minimal) numbers of packets for accurate flow classification. Full details can be found in\nthis paper\n(or the\npreprint version\n), which has been accepted to ACM SIGMETRICS 2025.\nClassifying network flows early or accurately? A practical tradeoff\nBefore diving into the design of FastFlow, let\u2019s first look at some synthetic examples of network flows (Figure 1), which consist of time-series packets, to better understand the practical tradeoffs that ML classifiers need to take.\nIn Figure 1\u2019s example, the five network flows belong to video streaming services offered by two providers, namely\nUNSW\nand APNIC. The first few packets (in the dashed boxes) of each flow are likely to carry static content, such as the administrative data and initial requests, and thus exhibit deterministic profiles suitable for accurate classification. The subsequent packets carry dynamic application content that is often unique to each flow (not each flow type) and may contain little or negative value for classification of flow types.\nIt seems intuitive that an ML classifier could achieve optimal performance \u2014 both early and accurately \u2014 if it could precisely rely on just the first few packets of a flow, especially since these packets often have relatively static and deterministic characteristics. However, identifying the minimum number of packets needed for reliable classification remains challenging.\nIn addition to the diversified flow profiles within and across flow types, practical factors in large networks, such as packet delays, drops, retransmissions, and the presence of unknown flow types, make it even more difficult for a pre-trained ML classifier to select the minimal number of packets for each flow. Therefore, prior work often compromises by either using a relatively large number of packets (for example, the first 50 packets or those arriving in the first five seconds) to maximize accuracy, or a small number (for example, the first five packets for all flows) to prioritize early classification at the cost of reduced accuracy.\nEstimating the minimal number of packets per flow as a sequential decision-making problem\nInstead of accepting the common tradeoff, we designed FastFlow (Figure 2), which classifies flow using a minimal yet sufficient number of packets. The number is estimated for each flow dynamically during runtime. Such dynamic decisions (determining the minimal number of packets per flow) on time-series data have been formulated by the ML community as a sequential decision-making problem and can be achieved using classifiers trained with reinforcement learning techniques.\nTo alleviate the impact of practical network factors such as packet drops, retransmissions and arrival delays, Fastflow processes each flow at both per-packet and per-slot (a group of packets) granularities and algorithmically selects the most confident flow type. Other choices we have made for FastFlow are not discussed in this post, but you can find them in\nthis paper\n.\nApplication\nProvider\nMacro F1 (%)\nAccuracy (%)\nPacket (#)\nTime (s)\nVideo streaming\nMicrosoft\n98.70\n99.29\n3.25 + 2.32\n0.05 + 0.44\nYouTube\n97.98\n97.14\n4.25 + 3.98\n0.15 + 1.51\nQQ\n89.77\n86.32\n8.32 + 4.68\n0.19 + 0.36\nWeChat\n91.01\n91.56\n5.78 + 5.43\n0.11 + 0.40\nSoftware update\nFastly\n99.05\n99.33\n4.76 + 1.56\n0.01 + 0.02\nAdobe\n98.09\n98.24\n4.75 + 2.44\n0.02 + 0.09\nWindows\n93.84\n94.20\n6.40 + 2.97\n0.08 + 0.51\nApple\n95.20\n93.12\n6.61 + 4.16\n0.06 + 0.46\nVideo conferencing\nUbuntu\n98.77\n99.38\n6.63 + 1.55\n0.13 + 0.15\nDiscord\n98.74\n99.70\n1.20 + 1.59\n0.04 + 0.03\nWhatsApp\n99.22\n99.38\n2.99 + 2.30\n0.39 + 2.45\nGoogle Meet\n98.41\n96.87\n4.00 + 4.09\n0.13 + 0.05\nMS Teams\n98.68\n99.20\n2.51 + 1.45\n0.57 + 2.51\nFaceTime\n97.77\n95.65\n3.65 + 3.60\n0.38 + 1.80\nZoom\n97.41\n98.62\n4.12 + 4.45\n0.99 + 3.62\nSocial media\nTikTok\n83.51\n86.36\n6.31 + 3.52\n0.13 + 0.18\nInstagram\n85.17\n88.97\n11.16 + 5.57\n0.29 + 1.39\nFacebook\n82.35\n82.12\n9.90 + 5.23\n0.06 + 0.28\nLinkedIn\n81.16\n89.09\n10.52 + 5.26\n0.27 + 1.62\nReddit\n84.61\n88.85\n9.09 + 4.62\n0.67 + 4.10\nTwitter\n84.06\n88.14\n3.85 + 4.11\n0.02 + 0.10\nFile storage\nApple iCloud\n96.44\n95.00\n11.89 + 4.62\n0.05 + 0.10\nMS Sharepoint\n91.94\n95.65\n7.35 + 4.40\n0.05 + 0.27\nDropbox\n96.42\n97.29\n8.12 + 2.63\n0.08 + 0.12\nGoogle Drive\n97.77\n96.24\n3.85 + 4.11\n0.02 + 0.10\nOneDrive\n88.37\n84.73\n9.63 + 3.95\n0.03 + 0.07\nTable 1 \u2014 FastFlow classification performance in our campus network deployment.\nFastFlow has been prototyped in our campus network for a proof-of-concept deployment. The classifiers are trained to classify flows belonging to six application types from 26 popular providers, as shown in Table 1.\nFlows that do not fall into these categories are expected to be labelled as the unknown type. The accuracy of FastFlow, measured as Macro F1 and Accuracy metrics, is satisfactory compared to state-of-the-art ML methods that use many (more than 50) packets per flow for accurate classification. FastFlow achieves such classification performance using only a very small number of packets (an average of 8.37 packets in 0.5 seconds), dynamically estimated at runtime for each flow, making it more cost-effective for deployment in large networks.\nMinzhao Lyu is a lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia, where he received the B.Eng. degree (First Class Hons.) and the Ph.D. degree in 2017 and 2022\n, respectively.

Black Ops 7\n\u2018s campaign. Call of Duty has always been sold first and foremost on its multiplayer, but the campaigns are also a major piece of the puzzle. Only one Call of Duty game has dared to release without a campaign and it was lambasted by fans as a result. Despite the fact that they\u2019re pretty short, people love how cinematic, bombastic, and fun the Call of Duty campaigns are. They\u2019re a great way to learn how the game feels and plays before jumping into the chaos of multiplayer.\nHowever, other complications have sometimes resulted in\nlackluster Call of Duty campaigns\n.\nModern Warfare III\n, for instance, was reportedly planned to be more of an expansion to\nMWII\n, but when plans changed for it to be a full premium release, the campaign was changed to continue the mainline story of Captain Price and Task Force 141. As a result, Sledgehammer Games had to develop a new story in less than a year and a half, which resulted in something pretty rocky and undercooked.\nBlack Ops 3\nalso tried to be pretty ambitious with a co-op campaign and more control over the player\u2019s loadout, but the final product fell flat with fans.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7\n\u2018s Campaign Will Reportedly Feature a Nameless Protagonist\nNow,\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7\nhas been announced\nand is due out later this year. The game is confirmed to feature a co-op campaign, but we know very little about what to expect. It\u2019s a\ndirect sequel to\nBlack Ops 2\nset in 2035 with returning characters like Harper and David Mason, but the plot remains pretty vague and the gameplay is even more unclear. However, a new rumor from Vondyispog has really upset some Call of Duty fans. According to the new rumor,\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7\nwill have players mostly filling the shoes of nameless, personality-less soldiers.\nIf you\u2019re not a long time Call of Duty fan, this may sound pretty standard to you as the series was known for this in its early days. However,\nCall of Duty: Black Ops\nshook things up by making you play as the actual main character and subsequent games took note of this. They had voices, definable traits, and so on. However,\nBlack Ops 7\nwill reportedly use the co-op structure to have players play as mildly customizable, random squad members with the \u201cleader\u201d of the lobby sometimes filling the shoes of David Mason, the game\u2019s protagonist. Players will also be able to make use of a safe house, as seen in the last two Black Ops games, to upgrade their characters and gear.\nCall of Duty fans aren\u2019t happy with this rumor as they want to play as the main characters and feel rooted in their struggle, as opposed to essentially just being along for the ride. Some fans are confused as to why this decision would even be made, as it doesn\u2019t seem to serve any real narrative purpose. The last two Black Ops games also featured silent, faceless protagonists despite having a pretty awesome ensemble of supporting characters that would\u2019ve made for great playable heroes.\n\u201cYou will be playing as nameless soldiers\u201d\nhttps://t.co/qdgX0L3AWx\npic.twitter.com/8684Movvep\n\u2014 The Knight\n(@GoofyAhhQD)\nJune 9, 2025\nThis fucking campaign is gonna be just endless Strike Missions in BO2\nhttps://t.co/a4cUZkEg8p\n\u2014 Ian Man (@IanMan20onYT)\nJune 9, 2025\nsilent protagonist in 2025\nhttps://t.co/SXzwPhC6Ra\n\u2014 Darth (@darthninjayt)\nJune 9, 2025\nI wasn't really in to begin with, but if this is true\nhttps://t.co/SISbusEzLF\npic.twitter.com/BhROuP8a00\n\u2014 Belinski_Paradox (@BelinskiParadox)\nJune 9, 2025\nJUST LET US PLAY AS FUCKING MASON PLEASE THATD ALL WE MEEDED\nhttps://t.co/UPOi71g5BC\n\u2014 bom360 (@bomm300)\nJune 9, 2025\nguess i'm genuinely skipping this campaign then lmao\nhttps://t.co/nIeetQJGiC\n\u2014 m (@whoelsebutmatty)\nJune 9, 2025\nI can\u2019t stand Raven.

We will hear more about\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7\nlater this summer ahead of its inevitable fall release date. However, this rumor does make sense given the last couple games in the series\nand\nthe co-op gameplay would mean the developer doesn\u2019t have to account for writing each playable character.\nWhat do you think of this rumor?

In light of that, we are happy to share his four portraits of the main characters of\nFirst Steps\n, which look absolutely amazing:\nThis is, of course, Granov\u2019s personal take on the characters, but we love it so much that we simply had to share them with you ahead of the premiere.\nHave something to add?

According to the Sant Agust\u00ed and Cala Major Neighbours Association, the grand majority \u2013 around 78 per cent \u2013 of the\nCala Major beach\n, located in Palma de Mallorca, is taken up by parasols, loungers, beach showers, storage, and lifeguard stations.\nNot only this, the prices of the loungers have skyrocketed in recent years, with beach visitors having to pay up to \u20ac26 a day to rent them. Moreover, the beaches in Mallorca have suffered extreme erosion due to consistent poor weather; rising sea levels reduce the beach space little by little, year after year.\nThe so-called \u201c\nsunbed wars\n\u201d are an annual problem when it comes to Mallorca\u2019s desirable beachfronts \u2013 there aren\u2019t enough loungers to accommodate everyone, and holidaymakers could pay a hefty fine if they try to bag the sunbeds early in the morning. But the Palma government is hoping to mitigate these issues and declutter the beaches by doing away with them altogether.\nThe number of sunbeds has already been reduced in 2025, and is expected to decline even more in 2026.\nTags:\nPalma de Mallorca\n,\nSunbed Wars\nShare this story\nshare on WhatsApp\nshare on Flipboard\nshare on Email\nSign up for personalised news\nSubscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nBy signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

Luckily, he has the help of\none of Marvel\u2019s most overpowered characters\n: the son of Professor X known as Legion. Legion in Earth-6160 is quite different from the one that readers are familiar with (more on that later), and he\u2019s able to guide Wolverine through the worst parts of his mind, giving him the strength to fight against what the Eurasian Republic has done to him.\nLegion is a very interesting character in the history of the Marvel Universe. Born David Haller to future Israeli ambassador Gabrielle Haller, Legion developed disassociative identity disorder, partly because of his natural mental powers, and each personality gained a unique mental power. David became one of the most dangerous threats on the planet, and the X-Men had to battle against him many, many times. Legion is having something of a comeback in the Marvel Universe lately, with two very different versions of the character making appearances. The Legion of Earth-6160 makes a major move in\nUltimate Wolverine\n#6, and it shows the potential the character always had.\nLegion Is Always a Wild Ride of a Character\nLegion is one of the more interesting characters in X-Men lore, and\nUltimate Wolverine\n#6 finds a new way to use him. The character\u2019s origin is revealed in the data pages at the end of the comic. In this universe, Xavier isn\u2019t as well-known, and no one knows that Legion is his son on Earth-6160. Legion was found by the new Ultimate Beast, as he was hacking the Eurasian Republic\u2019s computer system. The Eurasian Republic had control of Charles Xavier and Jean Grey, and got their hands on Legion. It looks like his body died at some point \u2014 much like Xavier\u2019s did, as revealed in\nUltimate X-Men\n#4 \u2014 and Legion\u2019s mind was able to get into the Eurasian computer systems. Beast and Legion made friends, and the mutant scientist was able to take the fractured part of David\u2019s psyche, all hidden in lines of code in the computer system, and bring them back together. Instead of being Legion, David became One, and became a ghost in the machine for the Opposition. The Opposition learned that they could hook One into other people\u2019s minds by linking them to their computer system, and that\u2019s what happened in\nUltimate Wolverine\n#6. Thanks to One\u2019s godlike powers, he\u2019s still able to use is telepathy, and with it is able to break the Eurasian Republic\u2019s control over the ol\u2019Canucklehead.\nRELATED:\nMarvel Finally Introduces Its Ultimate Sabretooth (& He\u2019s Nothing Like Wolverine)\nThis is one of the most interesting conceptions of Legion ever. In recent years, Legion has become less fractured mentally, much like One has on Earth-6160, and even played a large role in the Krakoa Era. Legion was the catalyst for\nThe Age of Apocalypse\nas well, accidentally killing his father while trying to kill Magneto in the past. He was also part of the reason that the\nAoA\nthrowback story\nThe Age of X-Man\nhappened, but we don\u2019t really talk about that. What\u2019s cool is that One isn\u2019t the only different Legion that fans are getting right now, as it was revealed that Legion is the villain behind Ms. Marvel\u2019s time travel adventures with the X-Men in the\nGiant-Size\nbooks that Marvel is putting out. This version of Legion is one that is without David, with his other personalities taking control. It\u2019s really cool that Marvel is using Legion in new ways, taking a character that is always a lot of fun and using him in ways that no one ever expects.\nOne Has His Work Cut Out for Him\nOne is as powerful as any version of Legion that we have seen before, and looks to be the Opposition\u2019s chief telepath. With One\u2019s help, Wolverine was able to break through the mental conditioning that the Eurasians put him through, giving the rebels an all-new weapon. However, it\u2019ll be really interesting to see One down the road as the Opposition\u2019s war against the Eurasian Republic intensifies for one big reason \u2014 the Eurasian Republic has mental control of Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force. That could lead to a very interesting change down the road.\nJean is connected to the Eurasian computer systems, and that leaves her open to One. Readers have wondered how this particular plot line would get resolved, and there\u2019s a good chance writer Chris Condon was setting this up for the future. The Opposition is going to need all the help they can get, and One is definitely going to be an important weapon in their arsenal.\nUltimate Wolverine\n#6 is on sale now.\nThe post\nMarvel\u2019s Most Complicated Mutant Just Made a Major Hero Move\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Wolverine's mind control revealed|Legion's assistance crucial|Opposition gains a powerful weapon|Jean Grey's connection to Eurasian systems poses a threat;E:Wolverine battles Winter Soldier persona|Wolverine fights his own demons|Legion guides Wolverine through his mind|Beast and Legion collaborate to create One|One breaks Eurasian control over Wolverine;D:Issue #6 is a turning point|Legion born to Gabrielle Haller|Legion has disassociative identity disorder|Legion is a dangerous threat|X-Men battled Legion multiple times|Legion's origin revealed in data pages|Xavier's identity unknown to Legion|Legion becomes One, a ghost in the machine|Eurasian Republic controls Charles Xavier and Jean Grey|One's telepathic powers are godlike;", "er_digest": "N:Chris Condon|Wolverine|Jean Grey|Gabrielle Haller|David Haller|Charles Xavier|Professor X;", "gist": "P:Wolverine's mind control revealed|Legion's assistance crucial|Opposition gains a powerful weapon|Jean Grey's connection to Eurasian systems poses a threat;E:Wolverine battles Winter Soldier persona|Wolverine fights his own demons|Legion guides Wolverine through his mind|Beast and Legion collaborate to create One|One breaks Eurasian control over Wolverine;D:Issue #6 is a turning point|Legion born to Gabrielle Haller|Legion has disassociative identity disorder|Legion is a dangerous threat|X-Men battled Legion multiple times|Legion's origin revealed in data pages|Xavier's identity unknown to Legion|Legion becomes One, a ghost in the machine|Eurasian Republic controls Charles Xavier and Jean Grey|One's telepathic powers are godlike;N:Chris Condon|Wolverine|Jean Grey|Gabrielle Haller|David Haller|Charles Xavier|Professor X;", "entities": ["Chris Condon", "Wolverine", "Jean Grey", "Gabrielle Haller", "David Haller", "Charles Xavier", "Professor X"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/apple-stock-drops-1-5-after-wwdc-2025-keynotedid-apples-big-ai-reveal-and-siri-upgrade-fail-to-meet-investor-expectations/articleshow/121734860.cms?from=mdr", "content": "Benchmarks\nNifty\n25,103.20\n100.16\nFEATURED FUNDS\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\nHSBC Large Cap Fund Direct-Growth\n5Y Return\n20.64 %\nInvest Now\nFEATURED FUNDS\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nUTI Aggressive Hybrid Fund Regular Plan-Growth\n5Y Return\n22.11 %\nInvest Now\nEnter search text:\nNews\nEnglish Edition\nEnglish Edition\n\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940\n\u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0\n\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0920\u0940\n\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\n\u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1\n\u0d2e\u0d32\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d02\n\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd\n\u0c24\u0c46\u0c32\u0c41\u0c17\u0c41\n|\nToday's ePaper\nMy Watchlist\nSubscribe\nSign In\nBusiness News\n\u203a\nNews\n\u203a\nInternational\n\u203a\nUS News\n\u203a\nApple stock drops 1.5% after WWDC 2025 keynote\u2014did Apple\u2019s big AI reveal and Siri upgrade fail to meet investor expectations?\nThe Economic Times daily newspaper is available online now.\nRead Today's Paper\nApple stock drops 1.5% after WWDC 2025 keynote\u2014did Apple\u2019s big AI reveal and Siri upgrade fail to meet investor expectations?\nSECTIONS\nApple stock drops 1.5% after WWDC 2025 keynote\u2014did Apple\u2019s big AI reveal and Siri upgrade fail to meet investor expectations?\nGlobal Desk\nLast Updated: Jun 09, 2025, 11:09:00 PM IST\nRate Story\nFollow us\nShare\nFont Size\nAbc\nSmall\nAbc\nMedium\nAbc\nLarge\nSave\nPrint\nSynopsis\nApple stock slipped 1.5% right after executives took the stage at WWDC 2025, raising questions about the company\u2019s new AI direction. Investors expected major breakthroughs, but reactions were mixed after Apple unveiled its Apple Intelligence features and updated Siri. Despite a strong lead-up, shares fell to $201.42, pushing market watchers to wonder if Apple is falling behind in the AI race. With a $3.28 trillion market cap, Apple remains a giant, but this WWDC left some hoping for more.\nApple stock drops 1.5% as WWDC 2025 keynote fails to impress investors:\nShares of Apple, which were flat before the conference, slipped 1.5% after executives took the stage at the company\u2019s much-anticipated Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9, 2025. The drop in stock price came as investors weighed the company\u2019s new announcements against high expectations, especially in the artificial intelligence space. Apple opened trading at $204.34 but soon began losing ground during the live keynote. By the afternoon, shares had fallen to $201.42, down $2.50 or 1.23% for the day. The stock hit a low of $201.42 and a high of $205.97 during the session. Apple\u2019s market cap now stands at roughly $3.28 trillion, with an EPS of $6.42 and a P/E ratio of 33.71.\nWhy did Apple stock fall during WWDC 2025?\nThe stock market reaction appeared tied to Apple\u2019s long-awaited moves in artificial intelligence, which many viewed as too little, too late. During the keynote, Apple introduced \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d, a suite of AI features powered by new enhancements to Siri and app automation. However, early impressions suggested the upgrades didn\u2019t go far enough to match what rivals like Google and Microsoft have already rolled out. \u201cInvestors had low expectations, but even those weren\u2019t really met,\u201d\nBarron\u2019s\nreported in its WWDC coverage. The subdued response reflected concerns over whether Apple is still playing catch-up in a space it once led with innovation.\nHow does this drop fit into Apple\u2019s 2025 stock performance?\nThe 1.5% decline on Monday adds to a rough year for Apple so far. Year-to-date, Apple shares are down between 16% and 20%, a sharp contrast from previous years where the tech giant consistently delivered steady returns.\nLive Events\nPart of the issue is perception. While Apple remains one of the most valuable companies in the world, its cautious approach to AI has left some investors frustrated. Other big tech names have gained ground quickly by betting heavily on generative AI, while Apple only recently began catching up.\nWhat are traders watching next for Apple?\nAccording to\nInvestopedia\n, options pricing ahead of the event suggested investors were bracing for a 3% to 4% swing in either direction based on the WWDC announcements. That swing has started to play out, but the full impact will depend on how the market responds in the coming days. Developers and tech analysts will now be digging into the details of Apple\u2019s software releases, and how these updates affect the company\u2019s broader ecosystem. If reviews turn positive, or if more updates roll out this week, we could see Apple stock stabilize\u2014or even bounce back. But for now, the immediate market reaction says it all: investors expected more, and Apple has some ground to make up.\nFAQs:\nWhat caused Apple stock to drop after WWDC 2025?\nInvestors were disappointed with Apple's AI announcements and Siri upgrades.\nIs Apple falling behind in the AI race?\nYes, compared to rivals, Apple\u2019s AI updates seemed less impressive to investors.\n(You can now subscribe to our\nEconomic Times WhatsApp channel\n)\nRead More News on\napple stock after wwdc 2025 keynote\napple ai reveal\nsiri upgrade reaction\napple share price today\napple market cap 2025\napple intelligence features\ninvestor reaction apple\napple wwdc stock news\nai impact on apple\nApple stock drop\n(Catch all the\nUS News\n,\nUK News\n,\nCanada News\n, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily\nInternational News\nUpdates.\n...\nmore\nless\n(You can now subscribe to our\nEconomic Times WhatsApp channel\n)\nRead More News on\napple stock after wwdc 2025 keynote\napple ai reveal\nsiri upgrade reaction\napple share price today\napple market cap 2025\napple intelligence features\ninvestor reaction apple\napple wwdc stock news\nai impact on apple\nApple stock drop\n(Catch all the\nUS News\n,\nUK News\n,\nCanada News\n, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily\nInternational News\nUpdates.\n...\nmore\nless\nExplore More Stories\nCanada job crisis: Canada\u2019s unemployment rate hits 9-year high as inflation rises, factory losses, and youth struggle in the toughest market since 2016\n19-year-old Jeevan Badwal emerges as a key player as Vancouver Whitecaps set new franchise record with a victory over Seattle Sounders\nNetflix, Apple, and Amazon fight against the CRTC rule as they push back on the Canadian order to fund local news and culture\nTwo dead after canoe capsizes on Ontario\u2019s Sturgeon Lake\nInside Canada\u2019s biggest defence shift in decades: New spending, NATO's 5 percent pledge, and Arctic priorities\nThe biggest explosion since the Big Bang;

It\u2019s been half a decade since the last episode aired, and yet\nSupernatural\nremains as beloved today as it was when Dean first burst through the door and into our hearts with a devilish smirk and the now iconic line \u201cDad\u2019s on a hunting trip and he hasn\u2019t been home in a few days.\u201d It\u2019s been a long, too long a road since then, and the boys have literally been through hell and heaven, saving lives, hunting things for the family business.\nThrough the years,\nthe show gave us many things\n. It gave up hope (fickle though it often was) and horror. It made us giggle with Dean\u2019s classic one-liners and tore our hearts open with a single man-tear. But beyond the heart, humor, and the horror, what makes the show what it is are its characters. Through the 327 episodes, we met some of the most well-written, layered, and dynamic characters to ever grace a horror show. From Charlie Bradbury (Felicia Day) to Sheriff Jody Mills (Kim Rhodes ), these characters left indelible marks on the viewers\u2019 hearts.\nBut if there is one character who proved to be nearly as popular as the Winchester boys, it is Robert Steven Singer (Jim Beaver), aka our ever-beloved Bobby. Except he was never meant to be a recurring character, let alone one who appeared in nearly every season of\nSupernatural\nsince his introduction.\nBobby Singer: He who Stands on Guard\nNamed after one of the show\u2019s producers, Bobby Singer first appeared in the Season One episode \u201cDevil\u2019s Trap\u201d. After that, he went on to become a recurring figure, appearing in nearly every season of the show and even in the spin-off series\nThe Winchesters\n. And why wouldn\u2019t he? A friend of the boys\u2019 father, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Bobby is not a character you easily forget. That said, according to Beaver himself, he was not supposed to be more than a guest character, with his appearance in \u201cDevil\u2019s Trap\u201d being a one-and-done kinda deal. But fate and fans had other plans, and Bobby just kept on showing up through trials and tribulations, ever protecting, always guarding, and becoming synonymous with home and hearth to the Winchester boys.\nRELATED:  7 Terrifying Horror TV Shows That Haunted Us For Years\nCranky, crochety, and with a penchant for saying, \u201cBalls!\u201d every time something goes haywire, Bobby is the father the boys never had. On his obsessive quest to find the yellow-eyed demon (to avenge the love of his life), John somehow forgot how to be a dad. He trained the boys to be soldiers from day one, even handing little Sam a gun when he was afraid of the dark. This gave both boys massive and unique daddy issues. While Sam fought to get away and leave behind his miserable memories, Dean only sought his father\u2019s approval, hoping one day to make him proud.\nThe CW\nSlowly yet determinedly, Bobby stepped up to fill the shoes of the Winchester Brothers\u2019 absent father. Despite a heartrending past of his own, he opened up his arms, heart, and home to the boys. They became his kids, his personal, favorite \u201cidjits.\u201d So, when he was shot in the head by the leviathan Dick Roman in Season 7, fans refused to believe that he was truly gone. Then he flatlined after calling the guys idjits for an apparent final time. But Castiel (Misha Collins) could heal anyone, and the guys had been dragged back from death\u2019s door and more than once. Surely they would bring back Bobby, like they did when Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino) snapped his neck during the Battle of Stull Cemetery?\nApparently not. Not in his original form, anyway. For a while, even though the brothers had burnt Bobby\u2019s body, he lingered on in ghost form, linked to his flask and refusing to leave the boys alone. But even that had to end, with Dean attempting to finally put his soul at rest by burning his flask. He appeared one last time when Sam went to rescue him from hell, and we bid a final goodbye to a character who had made us howl as many times as he had given us hope. Sure, the show is technically (and truly) about the Winchester boys, their unshakeable bond, and many emotionally jarring (mis)adventures. But it is also about family, and as Bobby himself once said, \u201cFamily don\u2019t end with blood.\u201d\nYou can stream episodes of\nSupernatural\nthrough various platforms.\nThe post\nOne of Supernatural\u2019s Best Characters Was Supposed to Appear in Just One Episode, But They Were Too Popular\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Supernatural's legacy is unmeasurable by ratings and viewership|Show explores themes of family, hope, and horror|Characters are well-written, layered, and dynamic|Bobby Singer became synonymous with home and hearth to the Winchester boys|The show is about family, as Bobby said, \"Family don't end with blood.\"E:Dean and Sam Winchester search for their missing father|Bobby Singer's initial appearance was meant to be a one-off|Bobby filled the role of the Winchester Brothers\u2019 absent father|Bobby was shot in the head by the leviathan Dick Roman|Dean attempted to put Bobby's soul at rest by burning his flask|Sam rescued Bobby from hell.D:15 seasons|Over 300 episodes|Bobby Singer appeared in nearly every season|Bobby appeared in the spin-off series The Winchesters|Sam was handed a gun when he was afraid of the dark.;", "er_digest": "N:Misha Collins|Felicia Day|Mark Pellegrino|Castiel|Dick Roman|The CW|ComicBook.com|Jensen Ackles|Sam Winchester|Lucifer|Charlie Bradbury|Jared Padalecki|Dean Winchester;", "gist": "P:Supernatural's legacy is unmeasurable by ratings and viewership|Show explores themes of family, hope, and horror|Characters are well-written, layered, and dynamic|Bobby Singer became synonymous with home and hearth to the Winchester boys|The show is about family, as Bobby said, \"Family don't end with blood.\"E:Dean and Sam Winchester search for their missing father|Bobby Singer's initial appearance was meant to be a one-off|Bobby filled the role of the Winchester Brothers\u2019 absent father|Bobby was shot in the head by the leviathan Dick Roman|Dean attempted to put Bobby's soul at rest by burning his flask|Sam rescued Bobby from hell.D:15 seasons|Over 300 episodes|Bobby Singer appeared in nearly every season|Bobby appeared in the spin-off series The Winchesters|Sam was handed a gun when he was afraid of the dark.N:Misha Collins|Felicia Day|Mark Pellegrino|Castiel|Dick Roman|The CW|ComicBook.com|Jensen Ackles|Sam Winchester|Lucifer|Charlie Bradbury|Jared Padalecki|Dean Winchester;", "entities": ["Misha Collins", "Felicia Day", "Mark Pellegrino", "Castiel", "Dick Roman", "The CW", "ComicBook.com", "Jensen Ackles", "Sam Winchester", "Lucifer", "Charlie Bradbury", "Jared Padalecki", "Dean Winchester"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://abc17news.com/news/crime/2025/06/09/benton-county-treasurer-charged-with-child-sex-crimes/", "content": "COLUMBIA, Mo.

Even though job growth held steady in May with the economy\nadding 139,000 jobs\n, the unemployment rate has stayed in a tight range \u2014 between 4% and 4.2% \u2014 over the past year, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s report.\nThanks to inflation fears, the Federal Reserve is hesitant to cut interest rates which are hurting businesses, big and small.\nJohn Starr, the owner of UltraSource, an importer and manufacturer of meat-processing technology in Kansas City, Mo., said, \u201cHow am I supposed to pay this?\u201d said Starr, a third-generation owner of the company. \u201cThat could wipe out profits for a year.\u201d\nREAD: Trump doubles down on steel and aluminium with his tariffs\n(June 4, 2025)\nStarr reportedly orders equipment that has a lead time measured in months.

The tariffs on imports, particularly from major trading partners, have contributed to slower economic growth, with forecasts predicting a dip in GDP growth rates. Inflation has risen, partly driven by higher costs of goods such as electronics and automobiles, which reduces consumer purchasing power.\nHouseholds are estimated to face decreased disposable income due to these price increases.\n\u201cAs long as the consumer is doing OK, it\u2019s not going to change our world,\u201d said Ric Campo, chief executive of Camden Property Trust, a Houston-based developer and owner of 58,000 apartment homes.\nAdditionally, retaliatory tariffs from countries like the European Union and Canada have strained international trade relationships, affecting industries dependent on cross-border commerce.\nFinancial markets\nhave reacted with volatility; while large technology firms have mostly withstood the pressure, smaller companies have struggled amid uncertainty and rising costs.\nOverall, Trump\u2019s 2025 tariffs highlight the complexities of protectionist policies\u2014offering some domestic industry protection but at the expense of broader economic stability and consumer welfare.\nREAD: US job market suffers under Trump\u2019s tariffs\n(June 6, 2025)\nIt is unclear what Trump\u2019s long term plans are regarding his tariffs, on one hand, the tariffs may bolster his support among voters who favor protecting American jobs and industries, reinforcing his image as a strong nationalist leader.\nOn the other hand, the economic challenges caused by higher consumer prices and slowed growth could erode broader public approval, especially among middle-class voters feeling the financial strain.\nAdditionally, strained trade relations might limit his ability to negotiate future deals. Ultimately, the tariffs\u2019 impact will shape how history views Trump\u2019s approach to economic policy\u2014either as a bold defender of American interests or as a leader whose protectionism brought unintended economic setbacks.\nThe post\nTrump tariffs killing the US economy?

Its red-hued surface and extreme chemical composition make it one of the most captivating yet perilous lakes on Earth. Despite its inhospitable environment, Lake Natron supports life, particularly salt-loving microorganisms and a special population of lesser flamingos. Its caustic waters, which are almost as dangerous as ammonia, can burn skin and eyes, and animals that die in its vicinity are often preserved in a\npetrified state\n.\nA Volcanic Chemical Wonderland\nLake Natron sits along the East African Rift System,\nwhere\ntectonic plates\nare slowly pulling apart\n. This geological feature is key to understanding the lake\u2019s unique chemical properties. The volcanic activity surrounding the lake produces large amounts of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate, which flow into the water from the nearby hills and through hot springs.\nThis continual influx of salts and minerals raises the lake\u2019s\npH level to around 10.5\n, making it incredibly alkaline. To put this into perspective, its chemical makeup is almost as caustic as ammonia, a substance known for its burning effects.\nThe lake\u2019s waters are so harsh that they can severely\nburn the skin and eyes\nof most animals. As a result, most creatures avoid the lake. However, some species have adapted to the extreme conditions. Among them are the lesser flamingos (\nPhoeniconaias minor\n), which thrive in this environment. These\nflamingos\nare drawn to Lake Natron for its abundant food sources, namely\nblue-green algae\n, which contribute to their distinctive pink hue.\nCredit: Nick Brandt\nA Sanctuary for Lesser Flamingos\nLake Natron\nis the\nworld\u2019s most important breeding site\nfor lesser flamingos, hosting approximately 75% of the global population. These resilient birds have developed specialized adaptations that help them survive the lake\u2019s harsh conditions. Their legs, for example, have tough skin and scales that protect them from the alkaline waters. During the dry season, the lake forms islands where the flamingos build their nests, keeping their young safe from predators. This makes Lake Natron an essential sanctuary for these birds, as they return year after year to breed and raise their young in relative safety.\nDespite the lake\u2019s harsh environment, its salty shores provide a unique habitat for microorganisms like haloarchaea, which thrive in the high salinity. These organisms give the lake its striking red and orange colors, often creating a stunning visual display. During periods of drought, when the lake shrinks, these microorganisms multiply, further intensifying the lake\u2019s vibrant hues. These same microorganisms also serve as a food source for the flamingos, making the lake an ecological hotspot for these otherwise desolate shores.\nThe \u201cStone\u201d Animals of Lake Natron\nPerhaps the most intriguing feature of Lake Natron is its ability to preserve animals that die near its shores. The lake\u2019s high pH level and the presence of sodium carbonate cause the bodies of deceased creatures to become calcified, turning them into lifelike mummies. This process has been captured in hauntingly beautiful photographs by artist and photographer Nick Brandt, whose\nimages of \u201cstone\u201d animals\nwere published in his 2013 book,\nAcross the Ravaged Land\n.\nLake Natron, located in northern Tanzania, is one of the harshest environments on Earth. Its water has a pH as high as 10.5 and can reach temperatures over 60\u00b0C.

It\u2019s imperative during this period of transition that we maintain adequate supply to meet growing consumer demand for electricity.\u201d\nThe ISO lists examples of repowering for different fuel types; for example, for wind resources, \u201creplacing turbines with greater capacity or upgrading older blades with more efficient technology can improve energy yield.\u201d\nBut it also notes elsewhere in the report that about 25% of New York\u2019s total capacity consists of fossil fuel plants that have been operating for more than 50 years.\n\u201cAs these fossil fuel generators age, they are experiencing more frequent and longer outages,\u201d NYISO says. \u201cGreater difficulties in maintaining older equipment, combined with the impact of policies to restrict or eliminate emissions, may drive aging generators to deactivate, which would exacerbate declining reliability margins.\u201d\nIt goes on to say that \u201conly New York\u2019s existing fossil resources and certain hydro generators deliver the full array of services needed to balance a dynamic grid. Despite the need to reduce fossil fuel use to meet the state\u2019s emissions-reduction targets, some level of fossil-fired generation will be needed for reliable power system operations until the capabilities they offer can be provided by other resources.\u201d\nBut the NYISO Market Monitoring Unit noted in its State of the Market\nreport\nfor 2024 last month \u2014 and as New York regulators have acknowledged \u2014 development of new renewable and storage resources is severely lagging the state\u2019s targets. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) required a 70% clean generation mix by 2030, a target officials have admitted is likely already out of reach. (See\nN.Y. Moves to Boost Lagging Clean Energy Development\n.)\n\u201cWhile over 14 GW of Tier 1 awards have been announced under the [Clean Energy Standard], just 9% have entered service, while 61% have been canceled, and most of the remainder have not yet moved forward with construction,\u201d the MMU wrote. Among the reasons listed for the delays and cancellations are weak nonperformance penalties, giving developers increased incentive to submit more aggressive bids. \u201cConsequently, awards are more likely to go to projects that are relatively unlikely to be constructed.\u201d\nThe report \u201cclearly demonstrates that the time for state action is now,\u201d Gavin Donohue, president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cEnergy consumption will continue to increase as New York strives to achieve its electrification goals, and that will require a diverse energy portfolio, as well as modernized generation units.

In the literature these are known as\nrules and standards\nrespectively.\nIn computational complexity, we generally think of complexity as bad. We want to solve problems quickly and simply. Sometimes complexity is good, if you want to hide information, generate randomness or need some\nfriction\n. But mostly we want simplicity. How does simplicity guide us in setting guidance, either through rules or standards?\nRules are like a computer program. Feed in the input and get an output. Predictable and easy to compute. So why not always have tight rules?\nNobody ever gets a computer program right the first time, and the same goes for rules. Rules can be overly restrictive or have loopholes, leading to feelings of unfairness. Rules can require hoops to jump through to get things done. Rules don't engender trust to the ones the rules apply to, like very tight requirements on how grant funds can be spent. We know that in general\nwe can't predict anything about how a computer program behaves\n, so why do we trust the rules?\nA good example of a standard is that a PhD dissertation requires significant original research. Rules are things like the exact formatting requirements of a thesis, or statements like a CS thesis must contain three papers published in a specific given set of conferences.\nAs an administrator I like to focus on making decisions based on what's best for my unit, as opposed to ensuring I followed every letter of every rule. Because if you live by the rules, you'll die by the rules.\u00a0 People will try to use their interpretation of the rules to force your hand.\nSometimes we do need strict rules, like safety standards, especially for people unfamiliar with the equipment. Structured rules do give a complete clarity of when an action is allowed. But it also gives an excuse. Have you ever been satisfied by someone who did something you didn't like but said \"I was just following the rules\"?\nEven strict rules tend to have an out, like a petition to take a set of courses that don't exactly match the requirements of a major. The petition is a standard, open to interpretation to capture what the rules don't.\nAs a complexity theorist I know what programs can't achieve, and as an administrator I see the same with rules. I prefer standards, principles over policies. Set your expectations, live by example, and trust the people, faculty, staff and students, to do the right thing and push back when they don't. People don't want strict rules, but they mostly act properly when they believe they are trusted and have wide latitude in their work.\nPosted by\nLance Fortnow\nat\n1:32 PM\n4 comments:\nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nMonday, June 02, 2025\nComplexity theory of hand-calculations\n(Thanks to David Marcus who sent me the video I point to in point 4 of this post. Tip for young bloggers (if there are any) you can have a half-baked idea for a post and then someone sends you something OR you later have an idea to make it a full-baked idea for a post. That's what happened here. So keep track of your half-baked ideas.)\n1) When I was 10 years old I wanted to find out how many seconds were in a century. I didn't have a calculator (I might not have known what they were). I spend a few hours doing it and I got AN ANSWER. Was it correct? I didn't account for leap years. Oh well.\n(An astute reader pointed to a website that does the centuries-to-seconds conversion as well as many other conversions. It is\nhere\n. If such was around when I was a kid, what affect would it have on my interest in math? Impossible to know.)\n2) Fast forward to 2024: I wanted to find the longest sequence of composites all \\( \\le 1000\\). One long sequence I found by hand is the following (I also include the least prime factor):\n114-2, 115-5, 116-2, 117-3, 118-2, 119-7, 120-2, 121-11, 122-2, 123-3, 124-2 , 125-5, 126-2\nlength 13.\nI wanted to find the answer WITHOUT using a computer program or looking at list of primes online (though I do allow a calculator just for division and multiplication).\nOf more interest mathematically is trying to prove that there is no sequence of length 14. (If there is, then perhaps the attempt will lead us to it.)\nAssume there was a sequence of consecutive composites \\(\\le 1000\\) of length 14.\nMap each one to the least prime that divides it.\nAt most 7 of them map to 2\nAt most 3 of them map to 3\nAt most 2 of them\u00a0 map to 5\nAt most 1 of them\u00a0 map to 7.\nAt most 1 maps to 11. (Can look at 11*p for all primes \\(11\\le p \\le 89\\) and see any of them are in a sequence of length 14.)\nI'll stop here. This is getting tedious and might be wrong. So I asked Claude. It gave me a\u00a0 sequence of composites of length 19. Here it is (I include the least prime factor):\n888-2, 889-7, 890-2, 891-3, 892-2, 893-19, 894-2, 895-5, 896-2, 897-3, 898-2, 899-29, 900-2, 901-17, 902-2, 903-3, 904-2, 905-5, 906-2.\nCan one show by hand that there is no sequence of length 20?\n3) The more general question: what is the complexity of finding the longest string of composites all \\( \\le n\\) . This is actually many questions:\na) By hand: by which I mean only allowing multiplication and division and only of numbers \\(\\le n.\\)\nb) Theoretically. Use whatever fancy algorithms you want.\nc) Theoretically but can assume some Number theory Conjectures that are widely believed. The Wikipedia page on prime gaps is\nhere\n. (ADDED LATER- an astude commenter pointed out that we want LARGE gaps between primes, but the wikipedia article is about SHORT gaps between primes.)\nd) Do a,b,c for the set version which is as follows:\u00a0 Given \\(n\\) and\\( L\\) determine if there a sequence of consecutive composites of length L that are all \\(\\le n\\).\n4) Does anyone else care about calculation-by-hand? Yes! There are people who want to compute\\(\\ pi\\) to many places JUST BY HAND. Here is a video about them\nhere\n. Spoiler alert: they did very well.\nPosted by\ngasarch\nat\n7:15 AM\n6 comments:\nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nWednesday, May 28, 2025\nThe Hilltop Story\nOn Route 1 in Saugus, Massachusetts, about a twenty minute drive from Cambridge, stood the\nHilltop Steak House\n. When I went to graduate school in the late 80's, Hilltop led all restaurants in the United States by sales (about $30 million in annual revenue) and volume (about 2.5 million customers).\nI went there several times during graduate school. Despite the size, about 1500 seats, always a long wait but worth it to get a good steak at a price a grad student could afford.\nBut in 1994, Hilltop was bought by an investment company from the original Giuffrida family. The cost of labor went up and to keep costs reasonable, the new owners cut the quality of the meat. No longer a place to get good steak at a good price and with changing tastes, they lost customers and would finally close in 2013.\nComputer Science as an academic discipline has had its Hilltop moment with tremendous growth pretty consistently from 2010 through about 2023. But with the growth of AI and an uncertain job market, if we don't maintain quality and adjust to the new needs and interests of our students, CS may become just a road sign on Route 1.\nPosted by\nLance Fortnow\nat\n11:32 AM\n5 comments:\nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nSunday, May 25, 2025\nSome are Mathematicians, some are Carpenters' Wives, Some are Popes.\n(Trivia: What song has the lyric\nSome are Mathematicians, some are Carpenters's wives\n? It's not a parody song, though sometimes it's hard to tell a\u00a0 parody song from a so-called real song.)\nIn my post about Pope Leo XIV I made the following comments in different parts of the post:\nPope Leo XIV has a degree in Mathematics.\nPrevost [his pre-Pope name] has a degree in mathematics from Villanova.\nHe is not the first Pope to know some mathematics.\nI also wrote:\nSince Pope Leo XIV was a mathematician, as Pope he won't only know about sin but also about cos.\nSomeone emailed me about this line, not to say it was a bad joke or even a good joke, but to say\nSince Pope Leo XIV was a mathematician\n: What qualifies one to be considered a\nmathematician\n?\nA few thoughts on this question.\n1) I blogged about this topic\nhere\n. Hence today I will discuss issues I did not discuss then.\n2) Robert W\u00a0 Prevost wrote a book that (just from the title) seems to use some math:\nProbability and Theistic Explanations\n, see\nhere\n.\nthat was published in print in 1990 and online in 2023.\u00a0 I wonder if it will sell more copies now.\u00a0 I am tempted to ask for a free copy to read and do a review of, but I'm not sure I really want to read it.\nOne would think that if someone named Robert Prevost wrote a book that seems to use math and theology then it would be the Robert Prevost who is now called Pope Leo XIV. I thought that. A commenter on my blog thought that. But Lance read an earlier version of this post and pointed out that\nRobert W Prevost NE Robert\u00a0 F Prevost AND\nRobert F\u00a0 Prevost = Pope Leo XIV.\nHence, alas, the author of the book is NOT Pope Leo XIV. It's striking how plausible it would be that Pope Leo IS the author.\u00a0 The book STILL might sell more copies since people may think it's by the Pope.\nRobert W Prevost's Wikipedia page is\nhere\n.\nRobert F Prevost's Wikipedia page is\nhere\n.\n3) If someone keeps LEARNING math but doesn't DO math I WOULD consider them a mathematician.\n4) If someone is a math crank then the question of\nare they a mathematician\nwill depend on how cranky they are.\n5) If one KNOWS a lot of math but is neither learning anymore or doing any more (perhaps myself when I retire) can you consider them a mathematician?\n6) If someone gets a PhD from MIT in Pure math but then goes to industry and programs would you consider them to be a mathematician?\n7) If X is NOT a math crank and X considers themselves a mathematician, are they a mathematician?\n8) I WOULD consider applied math to be math. This should not need to be said but there may be some pure-math-snobs reading this post. Computer scientists, statisticians, are more of a borderline case that, without being a snob, I might not consider mathematicians.\n9)\u00a0 Someone posted on the blog where this came up\nDoes Lance consider himself a mathematician?\nI asked Lance and he said:\nFor the next 37 days I consider myself a Dean.

A list of Onion stories that were mistaken for reality (or was it a mistake?) is\nhere\n. When I say\nmistaken for reality\nI mean that a large set of people were fooled.\nMy own Ramsey-History-Hoax (blog\nhere\n, latest version of the paper\nhere\n) has fooled some people; however the number of people is small since the number of people who know the underlying math is small.\nIn my last blog (see\nhere\n) I said that the Pope Leo XIV majored in math (that is true) and then I gave a false title for his thesis (I HAVE SINCE REMOVED THE ENTIRE PASSAGE).\nLater in the post I said that his ugrad thesis was not on that topic, but\u00a0 gave another false title (I HAVE RMEOVED THAT AS WELL.)\nI thought the reader would know that it was false, but onecomment inquired about it so I left a comment admitting it was false.\nThis is all very minor: Not that many people read this blog and very few non-math people would care about what the topic of the\u00a0 Pope's undergraduate thesis.\nThe last part of the last sentence is false. Its the POPE! People Do care about his background.\nBut surely my blog post isn't so well read so as to make the fictional\u00a0 title of his thesis a hoax that fools a lot of people.\nEven so, I left a comment wondering if LLM's might learn the incorrect title of the Pope's ugrad thesis.\nA reader named E posted the following:\nIt might be too late. I did this search this evening:\nE: Did Pope Leo XIV study Ramsey Theory?Gemini: Pope Leo XIV, whose given name is Robert Francis Prevost,earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from VillanovaUniversity in 1977.

But in the future this answer might pop up on the question`\nWhat did the Pope Study as an Undergraduate\n' or similar questions.\n1) Might future satires or April Fool's Day jokes be mistaken for reality in the future by AI and hence reach a much larger audience than this blog does?\n2) If so, should we be careful with what we post (not sure how to do that)?\n3) What about people who have a much larger following than complexityblog\u00a0 (yes, there are such people)?\n4) In the past one had to be a celebrity or similar to change peoples perception of reality (see Stephen Colbert and Wikipedia\nhere\n).

No doubt the NSF has seen better days, but first let's take a look back.\nAt the end of World War II, Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of Scientific Development, wrote\nScience, The Endless Frontier\n, where he laid out the importance of scientific research and the need for the US government to foster that research.\nA new agency should be established, therefore, by the Congress for the purpose. Such an agency, moreover, should be an independent agency devoted to the support of scientific research and advanced scientific education alone. Industry learned many years ago that basic research cannot often be fruitfully conducted as an adjunct to or a subdivision of an operating agency or department. Operating agencies have immediate operating goals and are under constant pressure to produce in a tangible way, for that is the test of their value. None of these conditions is favorable to basic research. Research is the exploration of the unknown and is necessarily speculative. It is inhibited by conventional approaches, traditions, and standards. It cannot be satisfactorily conducted in an atmosphere where it is gauged and tested by operating or production standards. Basic scientific research should not, therefore, be placed under an operating agency whose paramount concern is anything other than research. Research will always suffer when put in competition with operations.\nThe report laid out the National Research Foundation that would actually spread across three agencies, DARPA, NIH, and the NSF.\nWhile Bush didn't significantly mention computing, given the time, Computing would become a central part of NSF's mission with the establishment of the Computing and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate in 1986, placing Computing at the same level as the Math and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Engineering Directorate.\nIn 1999, the\u00a0President\u2019s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) issued a report that led to the NSF Information Technology Research (ITR) program, which became one of the largest NSF research initiatives of the early 2000s. The report helped reframe computing not just as infrastructure but as a\nscientific discipline in its own right\n, deserving of the same kind of basic science funding as physics or biology.\nCISE has led many initiatives through the years, for example the\nTRIPODS\nprogram established several centers devoted to the theoretical study of data science.\nIn recent weeks, the NSF director stepped down, hundreds of grants were canceled, new grants were put indefinitely on hold, indirect costs on new grants will be capped at 15%, and many staff members were pushed out. Divisions below the directorates are slated for elimination, advisory committees have been disbanded, and Trump's proposed budget cuts NSF\u2019s allocation by about half. The CISE AD (Assistant to the NSF Director, or head of CISE), Greg Hager, stepped down last week and through the CRA sent a\nmessage to the community\n.\nUnder these circumstances, my ability to carry out my vision, to provide a voice for computing research, and to provide authentic leadership to the community are diminished to the point that I can have more impact outside NSF than within it. Echoing Dr. Nelson\u2019s\npowerful article\n, leaving \u201callows me to speak more clearly in my own language,\u201d and, in doing so, even more effectively amplify the work of the incredible, dedicated CISE leadership and staff who continue to strive to fulfill NSF\u2019s mission.\nAs I move beyond NSF, I will continue to make the case for computing research. Computing is central to so much in today\u2019s world and computing advances are now core assets to the Nation\u2019s research enterprise. NSF\u2019s support for the past 75 years has forcefully demonstrated the value of computing research for advancing national health, prosperity and welfare; enhancing national economic competitiveness; securing the national defense and helping promote all of science and engineering. NSF-funded work has continually catalyzed new innovations, created new industries, and made us the envy of the world.\nWe all need to join Greg in continuing the fight to ensure that Vannevar Bush's vision continues to survive another 75 years and beyond.\nPosted by\nLance Fortnow\nat\n1:59 PM\n5 comments:\nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nOlder Posts\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPosts (Atom)", "ped_digest": "P:Pope Leo XIV studied mathematics|Pope's degree from Villanova|Pope's thesis titles were fictional|Satire risks being mistaken for reality|AI models may perpetuate false information|Ramsey Theory and Pope Leo XIV are linked|LLMs may learn incorrect thesis titles|Blog posts can influence AI training data|Computational Complexity blog is a source for Wikipedia|NSF panel in Washington DC|Hilltop Steak House closure|Computer Science discipline's growth and potential decline|Robert W.

We need to figure out how to get more out of the system while thinking differently.\u201d\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration\nsaid\nin January that the nation\u2019s electricity consumption grew by 2% in 2024 and will continue to grow at that rate in 2025 and 2026. It will be the first three years of consecutive growth since 2005-2007, with much of the demand coming from battery manufacturing operations and data center consumption.\nOne of the key questions, of course, is how much of that demand will actually show up \u2014 that and whether there will be enough resources added to the grid in time to meet the demand. (See\nFERC Dives into Thorny Resource Adequacy Issues at Tech Conference\n.)\n\u201cThis is the question I was waiting for,\u201d Amazon Web Services\u2019 Vibhu Kaushik said during a panel discussion on increasing capital deployment to meet new demands from data centers, advanced manufacturing, electrification and large resilience programs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all here together, and we are excited because this demand growth is real,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why is the demand increasing? It\u2019s increasing because customers today are using more technology than ever before. So yes, demand growth is going to go up.\u201d\nAsked the same question, Allen Otto, managing director of power, energy and renewables for Guggenheim Securities, said, \u201cNobody really knows, right?\u201d\nMaria Pope, PGE\n|\n\u00a9 RTO Insider\n\u201cWhere we get concerned is not actually developing the assets to where we can unlock the economic potential that we have a number of industry areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of projections that are out there, and at the high end, they are 4% year-over-year power demand growth for all those reasons that we\u2019re now familiar with. Even if it\u2019s half that, it\u2019s massive. It\u2019s massive, and part of the issue is if we don\u2019t move now, we\u2019re going to have challenges even getting there. We don\u2019t know exactly what the demand is going to be, but we do know that if we don\u2019t act now, we\u2019re going to fall behind our global adversaries and our allies, right?\u201d\nCongested generator interconnection queues don\u2019t help. A recent\nEnverus study\nfound that in 2024, new projects had spent anywhere from 9.2 years (\nCAISO\n) to 3.8 years (\nISO-NE\n) in the queue, an average of 6.2 years per grid operator.\n\u201cWhy do we have 2.6 TW of generation, a lot of carbon-free energy waiting to be connected to the grid?\u201d Kaushik said. \u201cCarbon-free energy that can be built in 18 months is waiting for five to seven years to be connected to the grid. Demand that could be connected faster to serve customers for essential services is waiting to be connected. The grid should eventually be a plug-and-play platform for all customers and all generators.\u201d\nJeff Bladen, energy leader for Verrus data centers, called for building out the grid, noting \u201cthere is no future\u201d in which the industry benefits without \u201cactually building stuff.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a sellout for building as much transmission as we can get approved. We\u2019re going to have to build more generation, right? At some point, you have to make electrons,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I like to tell folks is that it\u2019s important for us to get the most out of the grid we have while we\u2019re building the grid we need, right? If we\u2019re building large loads that are actually assets rather than liabilities, those will be assets for a very, very long time.\u201d\nTricia Pridemore, Georgia PSC\n|\n\u00a9 RTO Insider\nTricia Pridemore, a member of the Georgia Public Service Commission, said meeting the demand is the topic of conversation among state regulators \u201cmorning, noon and night.\u201d\nShe said her commission was first exposed to the concept of data center demand in 2023 \u2014 just as Georgia Power was bringing the Vogtle nuclear plant\u2019s third and fourth units to the grid at an\nestimated cost of $30 billion\n, more than double initial projections.\n\u201c[They] said, \u2018But wait. We need more energy.\u2019 You can imagine the five elected regulators just laughing them out of the office,\u201d Pridemore said.\nBut after getting into the integrated resource plan\u2019s process and meeting customers, the commission approved an IRP with 7.1 GW of new capacity in six months. Pridemore said it was the first IRP docket specifically developed for data centers and onshore manufacturing.\n\u201cWe have before us right now another 1,500 MW of new capacity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed a construct that gets these customers involved, that gives them a seat at the table, but most importantly, they\u2019re paying for it. We\u2019re constantly trying to build out this required and necessary infrastructure. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to be able to rise to this occasion, but we can\u2019t do it off the backs of our residential rate payers. All 50 states have seen rates increase over the last several years, so now\u2019s the time for us to be creative as regulators.\u201d\nPridemore found a friendly voice in Louisiana Gov. Greg Landry. He called for a \u201crecalculation\u201d of the regulatory environment, given the potentially billions of dollars in new generation for his state.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem that we have to solve: How do we meet the demand without laying it on the backs of the consumer?\u201d Landry said.\nSouthern CEO Chris Womack said utility work has to change in a future where technology and AI are likely to play such a huge role. He said lessons learned will be important because \u201cwe\u2019re doing some things we never had to do before.\u201d\nThe industry will have to navigate its way through construction, permitting reform, \u201cthe chaos in D.C. \u2026 all kinds of the tariffs and trade and just so many external factors that are coming into play,\u201d Womack said.\n\u201cWe will do this, but I think it\u2019s so important for us to really understand the reality of what we face, and the reality that\u2019s in front of us is going to be incredibly different,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technology is going to keep moving so incredibly fast, it\u2019s going to make us incredibly uncomfortable. We\u2019ve got to \u2026 be comfortable doing incredibly uncomfortable things. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have to keep pressing forward to meet this moment, to meet the challenge that\u2019s in front of us. And we will, but I think it\u2019s going to be so incredibly important that we find a way to do this together, to do this collectively.\u201d\nIndustry Faces Tariff Uncertainty\nThe administration\u2019s global tariff war is complicating the electric industry\u2019s efforts to meet historic levels of increasing demand. During the final day of the conference, the government doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%. For an industry that relies on steel and other metals to build its generating plants and infrastructure, the result is obvious.\n\u201cA lot of other things we can sort of mitigate, but we use a lot of steel,\u201d Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub said. \u201cAnd so when we have a lot of steel tariffs, it can really impact our industry and our cost structure.\u201d\nHollub said her governmental and regulatory staff have been unable to provide clear answers on what to expect out of Washington, D.C.\nEEI attendees network during a conference break.\n|\n\u00a9 RTO Insider\n\u201cFor the first time in my tenure as a CEO, I\u2019ve heard our government guy come to our board meeting and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 to more questions than [having] thoughts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t forecast right now. We\u2019re trying to come up with lots of scenarios and evaluate the possibilities that, clearly, the largest impact on us would come if the steel tariff were to stay high.\u201d\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is what\u2019s going on with the tariff policy,\u201d said incoming EEI CEO Drew Maloney. \u201cEverybody you know wants to understand how that\u2019s going to impact their businesses here and how that impacts our traditional trade partners \u2026 how that\u2019s going to impact business and sort of watching to see what happens.\n\u201cAs we develop this more of an America First policy, what does that mean for Europe? Is Europe going to do more manufacturing going forward? Are they going to sort of reshore their supply chain?\u201d Maloney added, calling for global collaboration with global trading partners \u201cbecause that obviously is going to impact our energy growth that we\u2019re going to have here.\u201d\nMaloney was\nappointed EEI\u2019s CEO\nin April, replacing interim CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn, effective July 1. Vincent-Collawn, CEO of TXNM Energy and its two subsidiaries in Texas and New Mexico,\nreplaced Dan Brouillette\nwhen he stepped away from the organization in 2024.\nMaloney brings with him decades of legislative expertise from working on Capitol Hill and maintaining relationships with key lawmakers for various organizations. He served in the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration and as chief of staff for the House of Representatives GOP leadership.\nGrowing up on a farm in the Shenandoah Valley also prepared Maloney for work in D.C.\n\u201cI had to get up really early in the morning to make sure that all the animals were fed,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to clean out the stalls \u2014 great preparation for working in Washington, because there\u2019s a lot of stall-cleaning in Washington.\u201d\nThe Benefits of AI\nWhile the growing reliance on AI could result in data centers\nconsuming up to 12%\nof the nation\u2019s power demands by 2028, speakers from the high-tech sector stressed the benefits of working with the technology.\nVictor Peng, the recently retired president of AI developer\nAMD\n, said he was impressed with his audience\u2019s willingness and desire to \u201cmeet this special moment in time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from everyone here how collaborative this industry is, and that\u2019s critical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see people committed to understanding how to support AI. Really, it\u2019s more than AI. This industry touches everyone\u2019s lives on a daily basis and in every facet. The positive thing about AI is that it will affect everything.\nVictor Peng, AI developer\n|\n\u00a9 RTO Insider\n\u201cYou should feel comfortable that this is not a bubble. The demand is real, and it will last for a really long time. And the pace that it is expanding at is daunting.\u201d\n\u201cI think anyone who reads history understands that adaptability and harnessing new technologies is really the difference between success and failure,\u201d Oracle CEO Safra Catz said. \u201cIt is without a doubt the difference between success and failure for companies, and it truly is the difference for countries and entire civilizations. There is no question that harnessing AI is widely recognized as a technical matter and a national security matter.\n\u201cThis is the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for, using data to get better information to really help you all run your business. So, this moment is very, very important, and it\u2019s going to be a challenge for a lot of folks to make the bold decisions of how do they move their technology to the 21st century. We\u2019re already 25 years into it.\u201d\nPausing for effect, Catz said, \u201cThe time is now.\u201d\nNew Leadership for EEI\nEEI\u2019s Board of Directors\nelected\nButler as chair for the 2025/26 cycle. The board also elected Womack and Evergy CEO David Campbell vice chairs. All three selections are effective July 1.\nButler most recently served the institute as a vice chair. The EEI\u2019s chair rotates annually.\nThe three chairs appeared on stage together before the membership June 3 to share their thoughts on the coming year. Campbell, a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan now leading a utility headquartered on the Kansas-Missouri border, wore a No. 3 Philadelphia Eagles jersey with Butler\u2019s name of it, much to the delight of Butler and Campbell.\n\u201cMany of you were coming up to me saying, \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up with David wearing an Eagles jersey?\u2019\u201d Butler said. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s just David being David, and I\u2019m flattered.\u2019\u201d\nIt became obvious who was the loser of a 2025 Super Bowl bet. As a reminder, Butler\u2019s Eagles had no trouble with Campbell\u2019s adopted Kansas City Chiefs, 40-22.\n\u201cWhy number three?\u201d Campbell said he asked Butler. \u201cHe said, \u2018Because that\u2019s my favorite number.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBut what do Eagles do? You know what you have to do,\u201d Womack said, flapping his arms and encouraging Campbell to sing the Eagles\u2019 fight song, \u201c\nFly, Eagles Fly\n.\u201d\nCampbell declined. However, he did complete his losing wager with a robust and quick \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!\u201d, half-heartedly punching the air with his right fist.\n\u201cThis is a devastating day for me,\u201d he said.\nLouisiana Gov. Ribs Entergy\nDrew Marsh, Entergy\n|\n\u00a9 RTO Insider\nAs the EEI\u2019s host member, Entergy was given the honor of conducting the conference\u2019s opening discussion, a conversation between its CEO, Drew Marsh, and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.\nEntergy is seeking regulatory approval to build 2.4 GW of gas-fired power plants to service Meta\u2019s\nmassive data center\nin Northeast Louisiana. It\u2019s about a $10 billion ask that also includes 100 miles of 500-kV transmission and eight 230-kV lines.\nMarsh asked Landry whether the state can continue to attract large investments in the future. Given the opening, Landry responded without directly mentioning May\u2019s load shed that knocked 100,000 Entergy customers offline. (See\nNOLA City Council Puts Entergy, MISO in Hot Seat over Outages\n.)\n\u201cI mean, the question is, can y\u2019all keep the lights on?\u201d Landry said, drawing chuckles from the audience and a wan smile from Marsh.\nFaces in the Crowd\nAmong the industry CEOs and regulators at the conference were former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, now a lobbyist but still exhibiting a master politician\u2019s touch with reporters; former EEI CEO Tom Kuhn, now board chair for wireless communications company Anterix; PGE\u2019s Pope chatting on the sidelines with Grid United\u2019s Michael Skelly; Bob Gee, now a board member with the\nUnited States Energy Association\n; and Archie Manning, formerly quarterback for the New Orleans Saints and patriarch of the family\u2019s quarterback dynasty, and his son Cooper, whose own football career was ended by a spinal condition.\nThe Mannings regaled their audience with their tales of Archie\u2019s life in New Orleans and raising three boys who have quarterbacked four Super Bowl winners. Cooper\u2019s son, Arch, is expected to be the NFL\u2019s top draft pick should he leave the University of Texas early next year. By all accounts, Arch is just as grounded as his father and his more celebrated uncles.\n\u201cClearly, I had an unbelievable mentor at home,\u201d Cooper said, referring to his father. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve had to ask, \u2018What would Dad do?\u2019\u201d\nArchie, who was sacked 337 times during his 11-year career with the Saints (nine of which were losing seasons), told the story about being honored as one of the club\u2019s 50 greatest players. During a banquet honoring the players, Manning, recovering from knee-replacement surgery, limped to the podium to say a few words. One of his \u201cold\u201d offensive linemen \u2014 \u201cwho, I assure you, was not one of the 50,\u201d Manning said \u2014 offered to carry him up to the podium.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to be carried, but if you and your buddies had blocked anybody out, I wouldn\u2019t be like this,\u2019\u201d Manning said to laughter.\nEdison International, Fortis Win Awards\nEdison International and its Southern California Edison subsidiary won the 97th Edison Award for domestic companies and Canadian utility Fortis won the international Edison Award, presented annually during the conference.\nEdison and SCE\nwere recognized\nfor the utility\u2019s Advanced Waveform Anomaly Recognition system, which supplements advanced sensors and other applications already in service with state-of-the-art physics-based AI models and machine-learning technologies. The technology can help to identify and locate problematic equipment on SCE\u2019s circuits before a failure occurs, mitigating outages.\nCanadian electric holding company Fortis\nwas honored\nfor its Wataynikaneyap Power Transmission System project, the country\u2019s largest Indigenous-led electric initiative. Fortis partnered with Wataynikaneyap Power and 24 First Nations communities to construct an 1,118-mile transmission line connected to 22 substations. The system connects 17 rural and remote First Nations communities to the Ontario provincial energy grid.\nThe Edison awards are chosen by a panel of former energy industry executives.\nThe post\nMeeting the Surge in Demand Without Sacrificing Affordability\nappeared first on\nRTO Insider\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Meeting electricity demand surge without raising prices|Historic levels of investment in energy|Need for grid modernization|Importance of AI and new technologies|Data center and battery manufacturing demand growth|Congested generator interconnection queues|Need for construction and permitting reform|Tariff uncertainty impacting industry|Importance of global collaboration|Need for creative regulatory approaches|Residential ratepayer protection|Utility work transformation with technology and AI|Importance of adaptability and harnessing new technologies|EEI leadership transition|Data centers consuming significant power|Need for bold decisions in technology adoption|Importance of data for business operationsE:Edison Electric Institute annual conference|Industry leaders discussing challenges and solutions|Calvin Butler elected EEI Chair|Maria Pope stepping down as EEI Chair|David Campbell and Chris Womack elected Vice Chairs|Louisiana Gov.

While Fable fans would have preferred for the game to show up, and even get a release date during the showcase, it not appearing is telling as well.\nThose hoping to get the Fable release date in the first half of the year or going to want to readjust their expectations.

It not appearing at this showcase, all but confirms it will be at next year\u2019s showcase. The showcase is Microsoft\u2019s biggest marketing beat, and it\u2019s not going to miss it with Fable.\nThis means the earliest Fable can come out is in the second half of June, but given the importance and size of the release, it is hard to imagine the turnaround between this big marketing pop and release to be too short. It is going to want to market the game.\nWhat this all means is Fable is probably not coming out until Q4 2026, or possibly, at the earliest, late into Q3 2026. Some have taken its no-show at this year\u2019s Xbox Games Showcase as a hint it is going to be delayed, but there is still plenty of room and opportunity for Microsoft to release this game in 2026. Further, let\u2019s not forget this game has been cooking in development since at least 2018 and was supposed to be a 2025 game. For it slip all the way until 2027 from this original planned release of 2025, seems unlikely, though it still can\u2019t be ruled out.\nIn the meantime, for more coverage on all things Fable \u2014 including all of the latest Fable news, all of the latest Fable rumors and leaks, and all of the latest Fable speculation \u2014 click\nhere\n.\nThe post\nFable Update Sheds Light on Release Date\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Absence of Fable at Xbox Games Showcase suggests a later release date|Release window reaffirmed as 2026 for PC and Xbox Series X|Likely release in Q4 2026 or late Q3 2026|Game has been in development since 2018, originally planned for 2025.E:Xbox Games Showcase held on June 8|Fable game absence from showcase|Phil Spencer reaffirmed 2026 release window.D:Release scheduled for PC and Xbox Series X in 2026|Original planned release date: 2025|Development started in 2018.;", "er_digest": "N:Microsoft|PC|Phil Spencer|Fable|Xbox;", "gist": "P:Absence of Fable at Xbox Games Showcase suggests a later release date|Release window reaffirmed as 2026 for PC and Xbox Series X|Likely release in Q4 2026 or late Q3 2026|Game has been in development since 2018, originally planned for 2025.E:Xbox Games Showcase held on June 8|Fable game absence from showcase|Phil Spencer reaffirmed 2026 release window.D:Release scheduled for PC and Xbox Series X in 2026|Original planned release date: 2025|Development started in 2018.N:Microsoft|PC|Phil Spencer|Fable|Xbox;", "entities": ["Microsoft", "PC", "Phil Spencer", "Fable", "Xbox"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/stranger-things-first-shadow-bad-reviews-plotholes-stage-play-tv-series/", "content": "Netflix\nAt this point, any move made by\nStranger Things\ncarries almost a legendary weight. Since it first dropped on Netflix,\nthe show created by the Duffer Brothers\nhas\ngathered a huge fan base\n, worldwide praise, and an aesthetic that\u2019s become a go-to for a whole generation of nostalgic productions. The story was so successful it grew into books,\ncomics\n, games, and all kinds of merch; so a play seemed like the natural next step \u2013 or at least something that was bound to happen (after all,\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\nand even\nBack to the Future: The Musical\nset the standard here). But\nStranger Things: The First Shadow\nmight just be the franchise\u2019s first real stumble.\nIt\u2019s a big production\nin style but falls flat in substance, trying to be a can\u2019t-miss event but failing right where it should be strongest: in the story.\nThe play, which kicked off in London\u2019s West End and\nthen moved to Broadway\n, is set way back in 1959, long before the main series events, and focuses on Henry Creel,\nwho we later know as Vecna\n. Alongside him,\nwe see teenage versions of familiar faces like Joyce Byers, Jim Hopper, and even Bob Newby\n, in a Hawkins that still feels innocent and untouched by the Upside Down. The promise was a deep, emotional, and scary dive into the origins of the evil we would see later. But in reality, it\u2019s a mix of stunning visuals with a story that struggles to hold up without the emotional baggage fans already bring from the show.\nnetflix\nTechnically,\nThe First Shadow\ndelivers what it promised.\nThe production poured money into\npractical effects, lighting, levitation, smooth scene changes, and even animatronics \u2013 all to capture the epic feel that TV lets you have, but now right in front of a live crowd. Some scenes are genuinely impressive, even bold, according to critics. But that\u2019s the catch. The play mostly feels like a sensory show, and in the theater, that\u2019s just not enough. The First Shadow stumbles by not giving its story the weight it needs, so it can\u2019t keep the audience hooked through a three-hour run. Basically, it\u2019s a clever way to pull in fans because of the Netflix hit, but it doesn\u2019t hold its own.\nThe script, by Kate Trefry (also a writer on the show), can\u2019t quite keep the drama going. By trying to be a prequel that adds to\nStranger Things\nlore,\nThe First Shadow\nleans way too much on fan service and callbacks to what we already know. There aren\u2019t any real surprises, and the play keeps flipping between wanting to be its own story or just a side piece to the TV show. If you already know Vecna and his background, the play doesn\u2019t add much (\nand it doesn\u2019t spoil the final season as well\n). If you don\u2019t, it ends up relying too much on references. The result is something that doesn\u2019t fully satisfy any crowd.\n[RELATED:\nStranger Things Prequel Debut Nearly Cancelled Due to Weird Technical Issue\n]\nReactions show this clearly. While outlets like\nThe Guardian\npraised the direction and design, and\nThe New York Times\ncalled it a \u201cmust-see for fans,\u201d highlighting its spectacular artistic direction and faithfulness to the series canon, others like The Washington Post were more critical, describing the play as an over-the-top visual spectacle with little narrative depth. Overall, critics are divided \u2013 some hail the impressive effects and faithful nods to the TV show, while others point out the weak storytelling and lack of emotional engagement.\nnetflix\nOn social media, especially among fans, you get everything from cautious praise to straight-up disappointment. Lots of people point out that, even though it looks great, the story drags, feels preachy, and just doesn\u2019t have much emotional punch. Reddit is still buzzing with debates about where this play fits in the canon \u2013 fans keep talking about plot holes and forced moments that clash with the show itself. \u201cThey seem to count on a handful of really brilliant special effects and (unnecessary) mentions and easter eggs to give the\nStranger Things\nfans the feeling that this was necessary to see and spent money on,\u201d\nuser @jaske93\nwrote.\nMaybe expecting this kind of reaction, Netflix put out a documentary,\nBehind the Curtain: Stranger Things \u2013 The First Shadow\n, that goes behind the scenes and tries to show how huge an effort it was to bring this world to the stage. Honestly, it feels almost like a defense: it shows the technical challenges, creative choices, and care to stay true to the\nStranger Things\nvibe. But instead of making the whole project look better, it just reveals the truth: this play might have started more as a spectacle exercise than a solid story. It\u2019s clear, for example, that\nparts meant to link the play to season 5 were cut\njust before opening, to avoid spoilers. So what\u2019s left is a narrative that starts out feeling important but ends up more like a side note (which is a big gamble).\nUnlike streaming, where you watch everything easily at home, the theater demands more: you have to be there in person, buy a ticket, and give up your time. When the payoff is mostly just visuals, frustration grows. Maybe\nThe First Shadow\n\u2018s story would have worked better as a special episode,\nspinoff\n, or comic arc. The idea to take\nStranger Things\nup a notch in a new format makes sense, but on stage, where things should be intimate and powerful, it ends up stiff \u2013 dialogue and drama can\u2019t keep up with effects that should just enhance the story.\nnetflix\nThe play isn\u2019t a total disaster. You can see talent in the idea, and some moments really move or surprise. But it\u2019s definitely the most uneven thing the franchise\u2019s done so far, because fancy effects don\u2019t replace a good story \u2013 it\u2019s pointless. Turning a huge hit like Stranger Things into a multimedia franchise always risks watering it down. Here, the theater ended up showing a bigger issue:\ntrying to grow a universe that maybe already said everything it needed on screen (in, literally, 10 years)\n.\nStranger Things: The First Shadow\nwants to be a key piece of the franchise, but it feels like something that could be wrapped up in five minutes in the final season. Sadly, it\u2019s a huge effort that says very little. It feels like brand entertainment, not real storytelling.\nStranger Things\nSeason 5 will release its first batch of episodes on November 26th.\nThe post\nStranger Things\u2019 Latest Franchise Expansion Might Be the Biggest Misfire of the Netflix Series\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Stranger Things: The First Shadow is a disappointing addition to the franchise|The play prioritizes visuals over substance|It relies too heavily on fan service and callbacks|The story struggles to stand on its own without the emotional baggage of the show|Critics are divided, with some praising the effects and others criticizing the weak storytelling|The play feels like a spectacle exercise rather than a solid story;E:Premiere of Stranger Things: The First Shadow in London's West End|Move to Broadway|Release of the documentary \"Behind the Curtain: Stranger Things \u2013 The First Shadow\"|Parts meant to link the play to season 5 were cut before opening|Stranger Things Season 5 release on November 26th;D:1959 setting of the play|Three-hour run time|Budget poured into practical effects, lighting, levitation, and animatronics|Vecna's origins explored|Joyce Byers, Jim Hopper, and Bob Newby as teenagers|The Guardian praised the direction and design|The New York Times called it a \"must-see for fans\"|The Washington Post was more critical|User @jaske93 on Reddit commented on the play;", "er_digest": "N:Jim Hopper|Kate Trefry|Stranger Things|Joyce Byers|Bob Newby;R:Hawkins|United States;", "gist": "P:Stranger Things: The First Shadow is a disappointing addition to the franchise|The play prioritizes visuals over substance|It relies too heavily on fan service and callbacks|The story struggles to stand on its own without the emotional baggage of the show|Critics are divided, with some praising the effects and others criticizing the weak storytelling|The play feels like a spectacle exercise rather than a solid story;E:Premiere of Stranger Things: The First Shadow in London's West End|Move to Broadway|Release of the documentary \"Behind the Curtain: Stranger Things \u2013 The First Shadow\"|Parts meant to link the play to season 5 were cut before opening|Stranger Things Season 5 release on November 26th;D:1959 setting of the play|Three-hour run time|Budget poured into practical effects, lighting, levitation, and animatronics|Vecna's origins explored|Joyce Byers, Jim Hopper, and Bob Newby as teenagers|The Guardian praised the direction and design|The New York Times called it a \"must-see for fans\"|The Washington Post was more critical|User @jaske93 on Reddit commented on the play;N:Jim Hopper|Kate Trefry|Stranger Things|Joyce Byers|Bob Newby;R:Hawkins|United States;", "entities": ["Jim Hopper", "Kate Trefry", "Stranger Things", "Joyce Byers", "Bob Newby"], "regions": ["Hawkins", "United States"]}, {"_id": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/justin-baldonis-lawsuit-blake-lively-dismissed-federal-judge/story?id=122660022", "content": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit against Blake Lively dismissed by federal judge\nThe \"It Ends With Us\" co-stars have been in a heated legal feud since 2024.\nBy\nAaron Katersky\nand\nAngeline Jane Bernabe\nJune 9, 2025, 4:52 PM\nJustin Baldoni's lawsuit against Blake Lively\nwas dismissed by a federal judge in New York on Monday.\nThe \"It Ends With Us\" co-stars have been in\na heated legal feud\nsince December 2024.\nIn his motion, Judge Lewis J.

The information comes from a known leaker named\nGameroll\n, who has previously shared a\nccurate details\nrelated to the game. These revelations largely align with a prior\npost\nmade on the GamingLeaks subreddit, strengthening the credibility of these claims as fans eagerly await Rockstar\u2019s official updates.\nAccording to the latest details, the much-requested six-star wanted level system is making a return, reviving one of the classic features from earlier titles in the series. In addition, relationship bars resembling the honor system from\nRed Dead Redemption 2\nhave been confirmed. These relationship dynamics will influence how non-playable characters respond to the player\u2019s actions throughout the open world. Furthermore, weight mechanics, underwater exploration with treasures and secrets, and the ability to greet or antagonize strangers are also included, echoing systems seen in Rockstar\u2019s past titles.\nThe character wheel system allows players to switch between Jason and Lucia individually or control them together during specific heist scenarios, providing flexibility in both mission design and free roam activities. Jason possesses a \u201cdead-eye\u201d style ability to slow time and highlight weak points during combat, while Lucia shares a version of this skill but in a more limited capacity. Reactions from non-playable characters to drawn weapons, the inclusion of male strippers, improved driving mechanics, and advanced gore and dismemberment features based on\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\u2019s system have also been mentioned.\nWeapons will once again be limited, with storage confined to the vehicle trunk, reminiscent of\nRDR2\n\u2019s system. The GPS system has been adjusted to a rectangular format with pink waypoints. Over 700 shops, multiple accessible skyscrapers, and shopping malls with functioning elevators are also rumored, although this particular claim was treated with skepticism by the leaker.\nOn the narrative side, minor story information surfaced, suggesting that Lucia has a troubled past involving the abandonment of her child prior to her arrest, a detail revealed in a flashback cutscene. Upon release, she reconnects with Jason, setting the foundation for their criminal partnership and eventual romantic involvement. Initial missions include pursuits involving drug deals gone wrong, leading to underwater retrieval operations, hinting at varied mission scenarios.\nThe story is reportedly structured into five chapters, similar to\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n, with the majority of the scenes seen in Trailer 2 coming from the first three chapters. Players will visit an island map lacking a panhandle region, differentiating it from previous speculation.\nSome features allegedly cut or missing include fully nude scenes, listening to music outside of vehicles, prone movement, dual-wielding firearms, a burglary mini-game, and a parody of Disney World.\nWhile none of this information is officially confirmed by Rockstar Games, the consistency with earlier leaks adds weight to these reports. However, as the game remains in development, some features or content may change before its scheduled release on May 26, 2026, for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nThe post\nNew GTA VI Leaks Reveal Story Details, Gameplay Features, and Mechanics Ahead of 2026 Release\nappeared first on\nGameInfinitus\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Return of six-star wanted level system|Relationship bars influencing NPC reactions|Weight mechanics|Underwater exploration|Character wheel system for Jason and Lucia|Advanced gore and dismemberment features|Rectangular GPS with pink waypoints|Story structured into five chapters;E:Leaks surfaced revealing story structure, gameplay mechanics, and design approach|Six-star wanted level system returning|Relationship bars confirmed|Weight mechanics confirmed|Underwater exploration confirmed|Character wheel system confirmed|Jason and Lucia controlled individually or together|Story details revealed about Lucia's past|Initial missions involving drug deals and underwater retrieval;D:Release date: May 26, 2026|Platforms: PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S|Over 700 shops rumored|Multiple accessible skyscrapers and shopping malls rumored|Approximately 700 shops|;", "er_digest": "N:Jason|Red Dead Redemption 2|Grand Theft Auto VI|Lucia;R:Disney World;", "gist": "P:Return of six-star wanted level system|Relationship bars influencing NPC reactions|Weight mechanics|Underwater exploration|Character wheel system for Jason and Lucia|Advanced gore and dismemberment features|Rectangular GPS with pink waypoints|Story structured into five chapters;E:Leaks surfaced revealing story structure, gameplay mechanics, and design approach|Six-star wanted level system returning|Relationship bars confirmed|Weight mechanics confirmed|Underwater exploration confirmed|Character wheel system confirmed|Jason and Lucia controlled individually or together|Story details revealed about Lucia's past|Initial missions involving drug deals and underwater retrieval;D:Release date: May 26, 2026|Platforms: PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S|Over 700 shops rumored|Multiple accessible skyscrapers and shopping malls rumored|Approximately 700 shops|N:Jason|Red Dead Redemption 2|Grand Theft Auto VI|Lucia;R:Disney World;", "entities": ["Jason", "Red Dead Redemption 2", "Grand Theft Auto VI", "Lucia"], "regions": ["Disney World"]}, {"_id": "https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/dick-vitale-contract-extension-invitational.html", "content": "He\u2019s back, baby!\nOn his 86th birthday,\nDick Vitale agreed to a new extension with ESPN\nthat will keep him with the network through the 2027-28 season.

It gives us some new looks at Riri\u2019s (Dominique Thorne) suit, which is clearly up for some modifications after her introduction in\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n. However, The real\nupgrade for the hero\ncomes at the very end, when we seem to see her creating her own onboard AI assistant. Unlike J.A.R.V.I.S., F.R.I.D.A.Y., and E.D.I.T.H., this AI takes on a physical form, apparently as a hologram, and she is played by Lyric Ross.\nAs expected, the\nsecond trailer\nfor Ironheart shows ups plenty of action, as well as the intrigue this burgeoning superhero will get entangled in. However, one of the most fascinating new additions comes at the very end as Riri sits in front of her computer, apparently asleep, with contacts attached to her temples. At that point, a friendly hologram tries to wake Riri up, declaring herself \u201cyour greatest creation yet.\u201d\nNot only is this an interesting revelation for Ironheart\u2019s capabilities, it\u2019s a tantalizing hint at the story coming up. Official press releases say that Ross will play Riri\u2019s best friend, Natalie Washington, but here she appears to be an AI projection. It appears Riri didn\u2019t make her that way on purpose, and it\u2019s unclear what that means for the real Natalie. However, the end-result is a virtual assistant with attitude that the audience can get behind.\n[RELATED:\nIronheart Star Explains How Tony Stark\u2019s Death Affects Riri Williams (& New MCU Villain The Hood)\n]\nIf this does turn out to be Ironheart\u2019s AI assistant, it\u2019s another brilliant way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe to recapture one of its most beloved dynamics. Tony Stark\u2019s (Roberty Downey Jr.) dialogue exchanges with his AI programs were essential to driving those movies forward in a natural way, and the same could happen here. We eventually learned that Jarvis was a butler who helped raise Tony when he was young, though the connection here between Riri and Natalie is very different.\nThanks to\nWakanda Forever,\nwe don\u2019t need a full-on origin story for Ironheart, but it\u2019s exciting to see that this show will still build on her personal connections and give her a reason to be a hero that MCU fans can root for.\nIronheart\npremieres on June 24th on Disney+, with three episodes to start and three more on the way.\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\nis streaming there now for those that want to get caught up.\nThe post\nIronheart Trailer Reveals a Major Iron Man Upgrade to the MCU Hero\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Riri Williams is upgrading her Iron Man suit|Riri creates an onboard AI assistant|The AI assistant has a physical form as a hologram|The AI assistant is Riri's \"greatest creation yet\"|The show builds on Riri's personal connections|Ironheart premieres on Disney+ on June 24th;E:New trailer for Ironheart was released|Riri's suit undergoes modifications|Riri creates her own AI assistant|Riri sits in front of her computer with contacts attached to her temples|A hologram tries to wake Riri up;D:Ironheart premieres on June 24th|Three episodes will be released initially|Wakanda Forever is streaming on Disney+;", "er_digest": "N:Dominique Thorne|Natalie Washington|Robert Downey Jr.|Tony Stark|Riri Williams|Marvel Cinematic Universe|Lyric Ross;", "gist": "P:Riri Williams is upgrading her Iron Man suit|Riri creates an onboard AI assistant|The AI assistant has a physical form as a hologram|The AI assistant is Riri's \"greatest creation yet\"|The show builds on Riri's personal connections|Ironheart premieres on Disney+ on June 24th;E:New trailer for Ironheart was released|Riri's suit undergoes modifications|Riri creates her own AI assistant|Riri sits in front of her computer with contacts attached to her temples|A hologram tries to wake Riri up;D:Ironheart premieres on June 24th|Three episodes will be released initially|Wakanda Forever is streaming on Disney+;N:Dominique Thorne|Natalie Washington|Robert Downey Jr.|Tony Stark|Riri Williams|Marvel Cinematic Universe|Lyric Ross;", "entities": ["Dominique Thorne", "Natalie Washington", "Robert Downey Jr.", "Tony Stark", "Riri Williams", "Marvel Cinematic Universe", "Lyric Ross"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://euroweeklynews.com/2025/06/09/solstice-clay-workshop-in-monda/", "content": "Solstice clay workshop in Monda \u00ab Euro Weekly News\nTrending:\nTraffic chaos after lorry crash on AP-7 leaves two injured\nCristiano Ronaldo lifts second nations league title\nIs Europe planning to ban Bitcoin?

The agency has officially canceled the Europa Lander mission, a project that had been in development for over a decade. Designed to be a rugged, semi-autonomous robotic explorer, the Europa Lander was meant to probe the moon\u2019s icy surface in search of signs of life. However, after overcoming many technological challenges, the mission is now on indefinite hold due to an array of insurmountable issues.\nA Robot Built To Explore Europa\u2019s Icy Surface\nThe\nEuropa Lander\nwas no ordinary probe\n. Packed with cutting-edge technology, it was designed to survive the extreme conditions of Europa\u2019s surface. Temperatures on the moon range from -134 degrees Celsius at its\nequator to -223 degrees Celsius at its poles\n, conditions that would devastate conventional spacecraft. But this lander, built by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), was equipped with specialized materials and radiation shielding to withstand such extremes.\nIts most impressive feature, however, was its ability to walk rather than roll. Unlike traditional\nrovers\n, the Europa Lander was designed with four sturdy legs that allowed it to traverse the\nmoon\u2019s terrain\n, collect samples, and drill into the icy crust\u2014all while operating with minimal input from Earth. This was particularly important due to the enormous communication delay caused by Europa\u2019s\ndistance of 568 million miles from Earth\n, making real-time guidance impossible.\nThe Difficult Challenges Of Reaching Europa\nDespite the successful tests on Earth\u2014including field trials on Alaska\u2019s icy terrain\u2014the Europa Lander was ultimately deemed too difficult to deploy. NASA officials pointed to several insurmountable obstacles, including the immense radiation exposure, the vast distance to Europa, and the very brief observation windows that would make a mission challenging. These concerns were compounded by significant budget cuts planned by the Trump administration, which drastically reduced\nNASA\u2019s funding from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion\n.\nWith these challenges, the Europa Lander project was effectively shelved. The mission, once considered a key element of NASA\u2019s astrobiology initiative,\nis no longer a priority for the space agency\n.\nCredit: \u00a0NASA/JPL-Caltech\nA New Direction: Enceladus\nHowever, the cancellation of the Europa Lander does not mark the end of its journey. Engineers at\nNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nare now pushing for the robot to get a second chance\u2014this time on Saturn\u2019s moon, Enceladus. Like Europa, Enceladus is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its\nicy crust\n, making it another exciting candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life.\nWhat makes Enceladus a more appealing option than Europa? The answer lies in the moon\u2019s more favorable conditions for robotic exploration. While\nEnceladus is still extremely cold\n, it has significantly lower radiation levels than Europa. It also offers better access windows, making it easier to deploy a spacecraft. These factors could make Enceladus a more realistic target for the Europa Lander\u2019s ambitious mission.\nWhile the Europa Lander\u2019s future remains uncertain, its potential to explore\nEnceladus\noffers an exciting new direction for astrobiology research. Whether the robot will eventually make its way to this distant moon remains to be seen, but scientists are hopeful that the lander will still have a vital role to play in the search for life beyond Earth.\nEnjoyed this article?\nSubscribe to our free newsletter\nfor engaging stories, exclusive content, and the latest news.\nFor more news like this, visit\nDailygalaxy.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Europa Lander mission canceled|Focus shifts to Enceladus|Radiation exposure, distance, and budget cuts cited as challenges|Lander designed to drill into icy crust|Enceladus offers lower radiation and better access windows;E:Europa Lander mission development over a decade|Mission placed on indefinite hold|Field trials conducted in Alaska|Budget cuts by Trump administration|Engineers propose redirecting lander to Enceladus;D:Temperatures on Europa range from -134 to -223 degrees Celsius|Distance of Europa from Earth: 568 million miles|NASA funding reduced from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion|Lander equipped with specialized materials and radiation shielding;", "er_digest": "N:Europa Lander|NASA;R:Alaska;", "gist": "P:Europa Lander mission canceled|Focus shifts to Enceladus|Radiation exposure, distance, and budget cuts cited as challenges|Lander designed to drill into icy crust|Enceladus offers lower radiation and better access windows;E:Europa Lander mission development over a decade|Mission placed on indefinite hold|Field trials conducted in Alaska|Budget cuts by Trump administration|Engineers propose redirecting lander to Enceladus;D:Temperatures on Europa range from -134 to -223 degrees Celsius|Distance of Europa from Earth: 568 million miles|NASA funding reduced from $7.3 billion to $3.9 billion|Lander equipped with specialized materials and radiation shielding;N:Europa Lander|NASA;R:Alaska;", "entities": ["Europa Lander", "NASA"], "regions": ["Alaska"]}, {"_id": "https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/06/09/1843200/apple-finally-brings-mac-like-windowing-and-menu-bar-to-ipad?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed", "content": "Apple unveiled iPadOS 26 at its Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday, introducing what appears to be the most significant productivity overhaul in the tablet operating system's history.

To ensure Fray can handle different scenarios, I wrote many\ncreative test cases\n. Many of them passed as expected, while some failures led to\nepic fixes\nin Fray. Then something unexpected happened: Fray threw a deadlock exception while testing the following seemingly innocent code:\n1\nprivate\nvoid\ntest\n()\n{\n2\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\nexecutor\n=\nnew\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\n(\n1\n);\n3\n// Shutdown thread.\n4\nnew\nThread\n(()\n->\n{\n5\nexecutor\n.\nshutdown\n();\n6\n}).\nstart\n();\n7\ntry\n{\n8\nScheduledFuture\n<?>\nfuture\n=\nexecutor\n.\nschedule\n(()\n->\n{\n9\nThread\n.\nyield\n();\n10\n},\n10\n,\nTimeUnit\n.\nMILLISECONDS\n);\n11\ntry\n{\n12\nfuture\n.\nget\n();\n13\nThread\n.\nyield\n();\n14\n}\ncatch\n(\nThrowable\ne\n)\n{}\n15\n}\ncatch\n(\nRejectedExecutionException\ne\n)\n{}\n16\n}\nThis code creates a\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\n, schedules a task, and shuts down the executor in another thread. Initially, I suspected a bug in Fray, but after investigation, I discovered that the deadlock was actually caused by a\nbug in the JDK\nitself.\nDebugging this issue was straightforward thanks to Fray\u2019s deterministic replay and schedule visualization. To understand the deadlock, let\u2019s first take a look of the implementation of\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\n:\n1\npublic\nclass\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\nextends\nThreadPoolExecutor\nimplements\nScheduledExecutorService\n{\n2\npublic\nFuture\n<?>\nschedule\n(\nRunnable\ncommand\n,\nlong\ndelay\n,\nTimeUnit\nunit\n)\n{\n3\n// ...\n4\nRunnableScheduledFuture\n<?>\ntask\n=\ndecorateTask\n(...);\n5\n// delayedExecute method\n6\nsuper\n.\ngetQueue\n().\nadd\n(\ntask\n);\n7\n8\n// addWorker method\n9\nfor\n(\nint\nc\n=\nctl\n.\nget\n();;)\n{\n10\nif\n(\nrunStateAtLeast\n(\nc\n,\nSHUTDOWN\n)\n11\n&&\n(\nrunStateAtLeast\n(\nc\n,\nSTOP\n)\n12\n||\nfirstTask\n!=\nnull\n13\n||\nworkQueue\n.\nisEmpty\n()))\n14\nreturn\n...;\n15\n// add task to a worker thread\n16\n}\n17\nreturn\ntask\n;\n18\n}\n19\n20\npublic\nvoid\nshutdown\n()\n{\n21\n// tryTerminate method\n22\nint\nc\n=\nctl\n.\nget\n();\n23\nif\n(\nisRunning\n(\nc\n)\n||\n24\nrunStateAtLeast\n(\nc\n,\nTIDYING\n)\n||\n25\n(\nrunStateLessThan\n(\nc\n,\nSTOP\n)\n&&\n!\nworkQueue\n.\nisEmpty\n()))\n26\nreturn\n;\n27\nif\n(\nworkerCountOf\n(\nc\n)\n!=\n0\n)\n{\n// Eligible to terminate\n28\ninterruptIdleWorkers\n(\nONLY_ONE\n);\n29\nreturn\n;\n30\n}\n31\n32\nif\n(\nctl\n.\ncompareAndSet\n(\nc\n,\nctlOf\n(\nTIDYING\n,\n0\n)))\n{\n33\n//...\n34\nctl\n.\nset\n(\nctlOf\n(\nTERMINATED\n,\n0\n));\n35\n}\n36\n}\n37\n}\nBug Behavior\nThe\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\nschedules tasks by adding them to a work queue and executing them in worker threads. Depending on the executor\u2019s state, users would expect the following behavior:\nState\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule\nFutureTask.get\nRUNNING\nreturns task\nblocks until task completes\nSHUTDOWN\nthrows\nRejectedExecutionException\nthrows\nCancellationException\nHowever, Fray revealed that when the\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\nis in the\nSHUTDOWN\nstate, the\nFutureTask.get\nmethod may block indefinitely waiting for the task to complete.\nHow the Bug Occurs\nThe bug manifests when Fray interleaves the\nschedule\nmethod and the\nshutdown\nmethod. At line 9 of\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule\n, the executor tries to add a new worker to execute tasks. It first checks whether the executor is in a state that allows the task to run. If the executor is in the\nSHUTDOWN\nstate, the\nschedule\nmethod assumes that the shutdown process will terminate the task, so it simply returns (Line 14) without creating a new worker thread. However, this assumption breaks when the shutdown method transitions to the\nSHUTDOWN\nstate but will not terminate the task, leaving it in a limbo state.\nThe following stack traces illustrate the problematic interleaving. The main thread (test worker) is going to create a new worker for the task, while the shutdown thread (Thread-3) is executing\ntryTerminate\nand setting the state to\nTIDYING\n.\nNext, Fray yields to the main thread, which performs the condition check at line 10 of\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule\n. The executor is now in the\nTIDYING\nstate, making both\nrunStateAtLeast(c, SHUTDOWN)\nand\nrunStateAtLeast(c, STOP)\nreturn true. The\nschedule\nmethod then returns the task without adding to a worker.\nMeanwhile, in the shutdown thread, execution reaches\nctl.compareAndSet(c, ctlOf(TERMINATED, 0))\nat line 16 of\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown\n. The\nctl\nis set to\nTERMINATED\n, and the shutdown thread completes. At this point, no thread will execute or interrupt the task, leaving it blocked forever.\nMore Details\nWhile the bug is conceptually simple, reaching this state is not straightforward because\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\nand\nThreadPoolExecutor\nare designed to prevent such situations. For example, in the\ntryTerminate\nmethod (Line 23-29),\nThreadPoolExecutor\nchecks whether the work queue is empty and workers are interrupted before setting the state to\nTIDYING\n. However, Fray demonstrates that this check can be bypassed if execution of\nsuper.getQueue().add(task)\nin the main thread is paused until the shutdown thread reaches the\nctl.compareAndSet(c, ctlOf(TIDYING, 0))\nstatement\u2014a classic race condition.\nDebugging with Fray\nImagine discovering this bug in your codebase. You observe a thread blocked on\nFutureTask.get\n, but you don\u2019t understand why. You cannot reproduce the bug because when you rerun the test, the deadlock disappears. Adding logging makes it disappear. Using a debugger makes it disappear. This is the notorious \u201cHeisenbug\u201d phenomenon common in concurrent programming.\nThis time, with Fray, you get a deterministic replay file that allows you to replay the execution step by step. You can observe the exact thread interleaving that triggers the bug and visualize the thread scheduling to understand the root cause.\nTry it Yourself!\nTo experience this yourself, clone the\nJDK bug repository\nand open it with IntelliJ IDEA.\nThen download the\nFray plugin\n.\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, open the\nScheduledThreadPoolExecutorTest\nclass and navigate to the\ntestWithFray\nmethod.\nClick the Run icon (\u25b6\ufe0f) next to the\ntestWithFray\nmethod, select the first\nRun 'ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorTest.testWithFray()'\nbutton, and then select\nfrayTest\n. If Fray finds the bug, it will display messages in the Run tool window.\nLook for the output\n2025-06-07 13:58:06 [INFO]: The recording is saved to PATH_TO_REPLAY_FILE\nand note this path for replaying the bug.\nReplay and Understand the Bug\nCopy the path to the replay file, navigate to the\nreplayWithFray\nmethod, and paste the path into the\nreplay\nfield in the\n@ConcurrencyTest\nannotation. Click the Run icon () next to the\nreplayWithFray\nmethod, select\nReplay (Fray) 'ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorTest.replayWithFray()'\n, and then select\nfrayTest\n.\nFray will replay the bug and pause at each context switch point (e.g., when the main thread is paused and yields to the shutdown thread). You can click the \u201cNext step\u201d button to step through the replay and observe how the bug unfolds. The Fray debugger also visualizes the thread timeline and highlights the currently executing lines in the editor.\nNote that Fray is designed for application concurrency testing, so it hides highlights in JDK methods by default\u2014you may only see highlights in the test code itself. However, since this capability proves valuable for testing the JDK, we plan to add a feature to show highlights in JDK methods in future releases.\nReporting the Bug\nWhen submitting this bug report, I created a\npatch\nfor the JDK that adds sleep statements to trigger the bug. However, the JDK team didn\u2019t include this patch in the public bug report. Instead, the final report only described how to reproduce the bug using Fray.\nHappy debugging.\n#Fray\n#Concurrency Bug\n#Concurrency\n#Jdk", "ped_digest": "P:JDK Race Condition in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor|Debugging with Fray|Deterministic Replay|Heisenbug|Concurrency Testing;E:Deadlock Exception|Test Failure|Shutdown Thread Interleaving|FutureTask.get Blocking|Race Condition;D:30 Minutes|10 Milliseconds|ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor|ThreadPoolExecutor|RunnableScheduledFuture|ctl.compareAndSet|workQueue.isEmpty;", "er_digest": "N:Ao Li|ThreadPoolExecutor|JDK|IntelliJ IDEA|ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor;", "gist": "P:JDK Race Condition in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor|Debugging with Fray|Deterministic Replay|Heisenbug|Concurrency Testing;E:Deadlock Exception|Test Failure|Shutdown Thread Interleaving|FutureTask.get Blocking|Race Condition;D:30 Minutes|10 Milliseconds|ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor|ThreadPoolExecutor|RunnableScheduledFuture|ctl.compareAndSet|workQueue.isEmpty;N:Ao Li|ThreadPoolExecutor|JDK|IntelliJ IDEA|ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor;", "entities": ["Ao Li", "ThreadPoolExecutor", "JDK", "IntelliJ IDEA", "ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://fictionhorizon.com/apple-tv-previews-big-year-ahead-with-new-teases-for-chief-of-war-foundation-slow-horses-and-more/", "content": "Skip to content\nStore\nNewsletter\nApple TV+ Previews Big Year Ahead with New Teases for \u2018Chief of War,\u2019 \u2018Foundation,\u2019 \u2018Slow Horses,\u2019 and More\nBy\nValentina Kraljik\nPublished on\nJune 9, 2025\nJune 9, 2025\n0 Comments\nOur\nEditorial Policy\n.\nShare:\nApple TV+ has just revealed a new featurette, and it\u2019s packed with exciting updates on some of its biggest shows.

(KMIZ)\nPolice leaders see a need for more detective units at the Columbia Police Department.\nPolice Chief Jill Schlude said she hopes to create a new unit dedicated to investigating auto thefts and thefts from cars as part of a long-term strategy to bring CPD to a staffing level she and command staff see as appropriate. Schlude said many of those vehicle-related cases are being taken by officers on patrol, but some are not handed off to detectives for follow-ups.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t assign out every case,\u201d Schlude said. \u201cIdeally, we\u2019d like to give victims enough services that when your house is burglarized, it\u2019s always assigned out to a detective. We just don\u2019t have the capacity to do that.\u201d\nCPD has a current authorized force of 194 officers. Schlude said 180 of those are currently filled. Of the 14 openings, two of them are sergeant positions in patrol, four in the Traffic Unit, two in Criminal Investigation Division, two in the Street Crimes Unit and in two in the Vice/Narcotics/Organized Crime Unit and two more in patrol.\nThe department\u2019s detective bureau is made up of three overall sections - crimes against people, property crime and a special victims unit, which focuses on things like crimes involving children and sex crimes. Schlude said the detective positions have been held open since she became chief in 2023 to ensure patrol -- the officers answering 911 calls -- has enough people.\nSgt. Matt Nichols, head of the Columbia Police Officers Association, said the group feels a need to get more people in investigative roles at CPD.\n\u201cTo take a look at cold case homicides, and sometimes active homicides that we need more manpower to thoroughly investigate,\u201d Nichols said.\nCPD\u2019s command staff requested 51 new sworn officers in its fiscal year 2026 budget request. Schlude said she expected adding so many staff members to cost more than $8 million annually -- paying for the costs of salary, benefits and equipment.\nThe department currently has a budget of $34.9 million. While the department doesn\u2019t expect to get 51 new officer positions in one year, Schlude said it at least makes it clear to the community and City Council what CPD thinks it needs.\n\u201c\u201cHow do [council members] know what the police department needs if we don\u2019t tell them?\u201d Schlude said. \u201cAnd so we got to all figure out a plan to make this happen, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they want to hear from citizens about what they want to prioritize.\u201d\nThe growth of CPD goes beyond just hiring people. Schlude also sees a need for the department to grow beyond its current headquarters downtown.\nABC 17 News takes a look at that issue in a special report airing Wednesday after the NBA Finals on KMIZ.\nThe post\nCPD staffing growth could lead to new detective and patrol units, chief says\nappeared first on\nABC17NEWS\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Need for more detective units at Columbia Police Department (CPD)|Staffing shortages impacting investigations|Request for 51 new sworn officers|Budget concerns regarding increased staffing|Potential need for new CPD headquarters;E:Police Chief Jill Schlude proposes new auto theft/theft from cars unit|CPD currently has 14 officer openings|Sgt.

Credit: Jsme MILA\nViolence against healthcare professionals in Portugal has increased by 9% in 2024, according to new figures released by the Executive Board of the National Health Service (DE-SNS). In total, 2,581 violence cases were reported\nby staff working in the SNS (Servi\u00e7o Nacional de Sa\u00fade) during the year. The growing problem has led to more sick leave, new prevention measures, and a tougher legal response from the Portuguese government.\nThe incidents included psychological violence, , and moral harassment. Psychological violence made up the majority of cases, with 1,703 reports. Physical violence accounted for 578 incidents, while 171 cases were classified as moral harassment. The remaining 129 cases were not specified in the report.\nThese incidents resulted in 1,185 lost workdays, as affected\nhealthcare\nworkers were forced to take time off to recover. The DE-SNS highlighted that the numbers are alarming and confirmed that efforts are being made to prevent further violence and protect staff on the front line.\nA serious case in Lisbon\nOne of the most shocking incidents occurred at the Curry Cabral Hospital in Lisbon. After a patient passed away in the Nephrology Department, relatives of the deceased allegedly attacked two nurses and caused damage to the hospital facilities. The PSP (Public Security Police) was called to the scene, and four suspects were identified for causing disturbances.\nThis case sparked fresh debate over the safety of hospital staff in Portugal, especially in high-pressure settings like emergency departments and intensive care units.\nEncouraging staff to report violence\nAccording to the DE-SNS, healthcare workers are now being urged to report any violent incidents they experience or witness. A dedicated platform has been launched to help staff flag threats or attacks. This system is part of a broader strategy to understand the scope of the problem better and respond more effectively.\nBy increasing the number of reports, authorities hope to gather enough data to implement preventive and corrective measures nationwide. The goal is to create safer working environments for doctors, nurses, and support staff in hospitals and primary care centres.\nNew legal protections for healthcare workers\nOn 18 April 2025, a new law came into effect in\nPortugal\n, strengthening the criminal penalties for acts of violence against healthcare professionals. It classifies most of these attacks as public crimes. This means that police and judicial authorities can launch investigations without needing the victim to file an official complaint.\nThis change is considered a significant step forward in protecting frontline staff. Under the previous legal system, many healthcare workers did not report assaults due to fear of retaliation, personal stress, or the belief that nothing would be done. Once an incident is known to the authorities, they are required to act.\nTraining and prevention in focus\nAs part of the prevention strategy, 449 training sessions were held in 2024, involving nearly 9,000 healthcare professionals. These were run through a partnership between the SNS, DGS, PSP, the National Republican Guard (GNR), and local health units. The sessions aim to help staff recognise early signs of potential violence and respond safely and effectively.\nThe training forms part of the National Action Plan for the Prevention of Violence in the Health Sector (PAPVSS), which focuses on raising awareness, improving coordination, and supporting victims. It also includes measures to reduce risks in high-stress areas like emergency rooms and mental health units.\nLocal support and monitoring\nAcross Portugal, 39 Local Health Units (ULS) and the country\u2019s three Portuguese Oncology Institutes (IPO) now have their own Institutional Operational Groups. These groups are responsible for monitoring and analysing all incidents of violence within their facilities. They also report yearly on the progress of prevention efforts and support the implementation of PAPVSS measures at a local level.\nThese multidisciplinary teams include medical, security, and administrative staff, working together to reduce risks and respond quickly to threats. The idea is to move from reaction to prevention and to ensure that no staff member feels alone or unsupported.\nA growing challenge\nThe rise in violence comes at a time when Portugal\u2019s healthcare system is under increased pressure. Staff shortages, long waiting times, and an ageing population are putting additional strain on the system.\nWhile most patients and families show respect and appreciation for the hard work of health professionals, a growing number of staff are reporting verbal abuse, intimidation, and even physical assault.\nHealth officials say protecting healthcare workers is now one of their top priorities. \u201cWe cannot tolerate violence in a place where people go to seek help,\u201d a spokesperson for the DE-SNS said. \u201cEveryone deserves to feel safe at work, especially those who care for others.\u201d\nLooking ahead\nPortugal\u2019s National Health Service is taking serious steps to address the rise in violence. The government hopes to turn the tide with better reporting, stronger legal tools, and ongoing staff training. But it will take time and a collective effort.\nFor now, authorities encourage anyone working in the SNS to report all forms of violence and to seek support when needed.

pre-orders for its much anticipated \u201cRevoltech Amazing Yamaguchi Evangelion Unit-01\u201d action figure.\nThis new figure will give fans the chance to own a high quality representation of the iconic Evangelion Unit-01 as it appears in the recent Rebuild of Evangelion film series.\nNeon Genesis Evangelion, which first aired in 1995, is a seminal anime series known for its psychological depth, complex characters, and groundbreaking mecha design.\nThe Rebuild of Evangelion series is a tetralogy of animated movies that re-imagines and continues the original story.\nEvangelion Unit-01, piloted by Shinji Ikari, is the most recognizable and central Evangelion unit and can be distinguished by its purple and green color scheme and its often berserk, unpredictable nature.\nThe \u201cRevoltech Amazing Yamaguchi\u201d line is particularly celebrated for its dynamic articulation.\nThese figures prioritize extreme poseability and expressive stances, making them ideal for recreating intense action scenes.\nThis new Evangelion Unit-01 figure benefits from the expertise of Kaiyodo\u2019s product development team, as it is based a completely new sculpt that \u201cpursues both mobility and styling under the overall direction of Katsuhisa Yamaguchi.\u201d\nThis ensures that the figure not only looks accurate to its animated counterpart, but can also achieve a wide range of dramatic poses seen in the original source material.\nThe figure comes equipped with a comprehensive set of accessories that allow for the recreation of various memorable scenes from the Evangelion films, particularly Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time.\nThe basic equipment provided includes a Pallet Rifle (the standard firearm of the Evangelions), a Prog Knife (close-combat blade), replacement parts to recreate the opening and closing of the shoulder container where the Prog Knife is stored, and the essential umbilical cable (power cable).\nThis figure also comes with the \u201cSpear of Cassius\u201d that Evangelion Unit-01 famously wielded in Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time, allowing fans to recreate climactic moments from the final film.\nIn addition to a standard head with an opening and closing jaw, a damaged interchangeable head version is also provided.\nThis highly detailed accessory allows collectors to recreate the dramatic battle scene with the Fourth Angel, adding a layer of realism and narrative depth to their display.\nThe figure is planned for release in February 2026 and it is priced at 11,000 yen (approx. $76.12 USD / \u00a356.16 GBP).\nGiven the on-going popularity of the Evangelion franchise and the reputation of the Revoltech Amazing Yamaguchi line, demand for this figure is expected to be high.\nFans are encouraged to place their pre-orders promptly at participating retailers to secure their copy ahead of the February 2026 release.\nIt can currently be pre-ordered at Kaiyodo\u2019s official stores (\nKaiyodo Online Store\n, Hobby Lobby Tokyo, Kaiyodo China T-mall Flagship Store).\nSource:\nOfficial Website\n\u00a9\nKaiyodo, khara.\nThe post\nEvangelion Unit-01 joins the \u201cRevoltech Amazing Yamaguchi \u201d

honoring 19 individuals whose skulls were returned to New Orleans after being sent to Leipzig, Germany, for racial pseudoscience over 150 years ago.  (Photo Credit: Malachi Casimire / Dillard University)\nBy Stacy M. Brown\nBlack Press USA Senior National Correspondent\nMore than 150 years after their crania were taken from New Orleans and shipped to Germany for racist scientific experiments, 19 Black Americans were finally laid to rest. In a moving display of remembrance and restoration, Dillard University, the City of New Orleans, and University Medical Center held a\ntraditional jazz funeral and memorial service\nto honor the 13 men, four women, and two unidentified individuals whose remains were stolen in the 1870s by local physician Henry D. Schmidt and sent overseas.\nThe ceremony, held on May 31 at Dillard University\u2019s Lawless Memorial Chapel, included student pallbearers, an interfaith service, and a burial at the Katrina Memorial. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, Dillard University President Monique Guillory and community leaders led the ceremony.\nNineteen African Americans whose remains were desecrated and parts sent abroad in the name of racist/colonialist pseudoscience, were finally laid to rest in full New Orleanian spirit with a jazz band and second line performed by Black Men of Labor, and Kumbuka Dancers.  (Photo Credit: Malachi Casimire / Dillard University)\n\u201cWe honor the lives of those who have gone before us and place in remembrance with dignity and respect the sacred remains of those 19 people,\u201d Cantrell intoned during the ceremony. \u201cAs mayor of New Orleans and on behalf of our citizens in the spirit of divine love, we pray that they will forever rest in God\u2019s perfect peace.\u201d\nGuillory said she was humbled that Dillard had the opportunity to host and facilitate such an important ceremony.\n\u201cDillard University is deeply honored to serve as a steward in the sacred process of cultural repatriation,\u201d said Guillory in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThis moment calls us to bear witness to a painful chapter in our collective history while recognizing the unique role our institution plays in preserving the dignity and legacy of those who were wrongfully taken. This is more than an act of remembrance \u2013 it is a restoration of humanity.\u201d\nThe remains of each of the 19 persons was memorialized in a handcrafted funeral vessel etched with their name, age and date of death. The vessels featured Adinkra symbols representing universal spirituality.

The vessels featured Adinkra symbols representing universal spirituality and were carried by students from universities in the New Orleans area. The service involved multiple faiths\u2014including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, SGI Buddhism, the Baha\u2019i tradition and West African rituals\u2014to honor the unknown spiritual identities of the deceased.\n\u201cThis was deeply cultural and deeply intentional,\u201d Eva Baham, chair of the Repatriation Committee and former Dillard professor, said during an appearance on\nBlack Press USA\u2019s \u201cLet It Be Known\u201d news morning show\n. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to bring them home just to store them away. They were brought back with reverence and sealed into the earth.\u201d\nAfter the memorial ceremony, the stolen remains of the 19 Black Americans were taken to their final resting place, the Katrina Memorial, which sits near the historic grounds where Charity Hospital once buried the poor and marginalized. (Photo Credit: Malachi Casimire / Dillard University)\nThe repatriation followed a 2023 outreach by the University of Leipzig, where the crania had been housed for over a century. Researchers there acknowledged the harm done and initiated the return. The remains, all traced to individuals who died at Charity Hospital in 1871 and 1872, were taken during a time when pseudoscience like phrenology falsely claimed to measure intelligence and inferiority by skull shape\u2014an ideology used to justify slavery and racial hierarchy.\n\u201cThis is how we begin to heal from the atrocities committed in the name of science,\u201d Baham said.\nThe final resting place, the Katrina Memorial, sits near the historic grounds where Charity Hospital once buried the poor and marginalized.\n\u201cWe may never know where their full bodies are,\u201d Baham noted. \u201cBut perhaps\u2014just perhaps\u2014we brought them back together in spirit.\u201d\nThe post\nStolen, returned, remembered: 19 Black Americans reburied in New Orleans\nappeared first on\nAFRO American Newspapers\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Restoration of humanity|Remembrance and restoration|Healing from atrocities|Dignity and respect|Cultural repatriation;E:Jazz funeral honoring 19 individuals|Memorial service at Dillard University|Burial at Katrina Memorial|Repatriation ceremony|Return of remains from Leipzig, Germany;D:150 years|1870s|May 31|1871 and 1872|Over a century;", "er_digest": "N:Dillard University|Monique Guillory|Henry D.

Is it the witty banter from beloved animated characters? A planet that looks like one giant snowball? Or perhaps specific\nIce Age animals\n, like the woolly\nmammoth\n, dire wolf, and saber-toothed cat. The Ice Age is a fascinating time in our Earth\u2019s history, so between the towering glaciers and\nearly human ancestors\n, there\u2019s a lot that you could think of.\nWhat probably\ndoesn\u2019t\ncome to mind is the view outside of your kitchen window or the parks you drive past on your way to work\u2014but believe it or not, we\u2019re currently living in an\nIce Age\n! Our planet goes through cycles that result in dramatic changes to our environment, and understanding these patterns helps us to predict what the future holds. So, what makes an Ice Age, what stage of this cycle are we in, and what can we expect for the future of our planet?\nWhat is an Ice Age?\nThe answers lie frozen across the world. Simply put, if both the North and South poles have ice, we\u2019re in an Ice Age. If at least one of the poles doesn\u2019t have ice, we\u2019re not in an Ice Age. Now, it might seem strange to imagine a time when there wouldn\u2019t be ice at both poles, but that\u2019s because modern humans have\u00a0never\u00a0lived during a time when there wasn\u2019t ice!\nHuman history only makes up a tiny fraction of the history of the world, and an Ice Age doesn\u2019t start and end in a matter of hundreds or even thousands of years. In reality, the cycles we know as Ice Ages last millions of years\u2014and our Earth has experienced at least five\u00a0of them! These cycles are affected by changes in Earth\u2019s orbit in relation to the sun, as well as other factors here on the ground.\nOne of several aspects of Earth\u2019s orbit responsible for long-term climate change is known as obliquity, which represents the angle of the planet\u2019s spin axis.\u00a0The Earth\u2019s axis is on a tilt that shifts subtly (less than 5 degrees) over the course of about 40,000 years! This tilt is why we have seasons and is one important variable that affects changes in our climate. Smaller tilt results in cooler summers and warmer winters, which can favor a \u201cglacial period,\u201d where ice builds up into glaciers that reflect more of the sun\u2019s heat back into the sky, making the Earth colder and colder. This is how we get the stereotypical ice planet that traditionally comes to mind when we think of an Ice Age. Glacial periods produce cold, and often times harsh environments that require adaptation or ingenuity to survive.\nA larger tilt can result in an \u201cinterglacial period,\u201d which is the opposite of the scenario above. Winters are colder, which does result in additional glacier build up. But because the summers are significantly hotter, the extreme heat will melt most of it away. Interglacials are harsh periods in their own way, which is why the transition between these periods of the cycle can result in the\nextinction\nof even the most abundant species.\nAre we living in an Ice Age now?\nOver the course of our planet\u2019s history, we\u2019ve experienced at least five Ice Ages: the Huronian (2.45 \u2013 2.21 billion years ago), Cryogenian (730 \u2013 580 million years ago), Andean-Saharan (450 \u2013 420 million years ago), Paleozoic (360 \u2013 260 million years ago), and the Quaternary, which began 2.58 million years ago (that\u2019s where we are today).\nAs mentioned above, each of these Ice Ages alternates between glacial and interglacial periods. The Ice Age we typically imagine (and the one that sets the scene for the Ice Age franchise), is known as the Pleistocene glaciation. It began around 2.58 million years ago and ended with the present interglacial period that began about 11,700 years ago. This interglacial period is known as the Holocene, and it\u2019s the stage we\u2019re currently living in.\nThe transition between the glacial Pleistocene and interglacial Holocene was associated with the\nextinction of giant, furry animals\nwhich evolved to survive in bitter, cold temperatures\u2014though the changing environment wasn\u2019t entirely to blame. Early people hunted some of these larger mammals, perhaps speeding up their ultimate extinction.\nWhen will we see the next Ice Age?\nThough we\u2019re already technically living in an Ice Age,\nquestions\noften arise about when we\u2019ll enter the Earth\u2019s next glacial period. Will we live to see the planet covered in frozen water? What will happen if we do?\nThanks to mathematicians and astronomers who are tracking changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit about the sun, we can make general predictions about when to expect the next icy era. Based on current orbital parameters, the planet should be cooling, following a long-term trend that began ~6,000 years ago.\nBut temperatures aren\u2019t dropping the way they should. People are altering the pattern, introducing unanticipated factors that affect our climate. Glaciers, for example, should be growing under traditional circumstances, but instead, they\u2019re melting. The impact seems small when compared with our relatively short lives, but there\u2019s no telling what that impact might have across geological timescales.\nThe history of ice on this planet\nMysteries of the Ice Ages\nexplores the past, present, and future of ice on our planet, helping visitors take a deeper dive into the many vital roles ices plays on the Earth. It highlights the seasonality of life and the creative ways some species have evolved in order to adapt to their environments. The warm fur of mammoths, fat insulation in giant ground sloths, and patterns of hibernation for short-faced bears are just a few of the many adaptations that allowed these iconic species to endure the glacial Pleistocene. But what happens when conditions change so rapidly that a species can\u2019t adapt? The later portion of the exhibition answers those questions too.\nExtinction is a natural process that all species will experience. But sometimes this natural process occurs at an unnatural speed.\u00a0Mysteries of the Ice Ages\u00a0raises awareness about this possibility, highlighting that the current rising temperatures have put over one million species at risk of early extinction, including the one of the most iconic cold-loving creatures: the polar bear.\nPolar bear populations on thin ice\nPolar bears rely on glacial ice sheets to survive. These massive predators require a\nlot\nof food to fuel their bodies and to produce the fat that keeps them warm. Most of their calories are consumed in the form of seals, though they have been known to eat other animals if available. Seals carve dozens of holes in the ice which allow them to surface for air as needed.\nPolar bears carefully crawl across the ice, staying low on their bellies, to hunt seals when they surface. As ice sheets continue to melt and disappear, polar bears are at the mercy of seals and whales that wash up on the beach or birds that happen to land nearby for a rest.\nAnd while polar bears could potentially evolve their diets to be less reliant on seals, the resources available to them on land are far less consistent\u2014let alone capable of sustaining the caloric intake a polar bear needs. But though polar bear numbers are dwindling, they\u2019re far from the only species at risk.\nHere in Utah, several species are feeling the ripple effects of a warming world. Aspens, Utah\u2019s state tree, live in communities with a shared root system. They\u2019re found in every country across Utah, a beautiful and vital member of many ecosystems across the state. As temperatures increase (even by small degrees), aspens become more susceptible to drought, and hotter temperatures can also increase the risk of wildfires or extreme heat waves.\nFor Utah\u2019s mountain dwelling critters, the high slopes of our Montane forests are like island oases. The climate in those higher elevation areas provides cooler temperature and more moisture in the form of rain and snow. Animals like the elk, Stellar jays, and garter snakes call the area home, and have adapted to live in a specific set of conditions.\nTake the pika for example. Pikas are small, adorable mammals that look a bit like hamsters but are more closely related to rabbits. They dwell in these alpine areas but cannot survive temperatures above 78 degrees. As average temperatures in Utah increase, pikas, and other mountain-dwelling friends, are faced with an unexpected challenge: There isn\u2019t a higher, cooler peak to migrate too, and moving to a lower elevation only comes with warmer weather. Fortunately, there are simple, attainable actions we (as individuals and communities) can take to protect at-risk species\u2014reminding us that\nthere\u2019s always a good reason to have hope\n.\nMysteries of the Ice Ages inspires visitors with simple, practical ideas on how to counter unnatural climate change\u2014no matter your age or circumstance. It\u2019s an inspiring encounter with the frozen world that will leave you in awe.\nProtecting at-risk species through simple efforts\nThe basis of any good conservation efforts begins with education.\nGet familiar with the science\nbehind Ice Ages and their cycles, appreciate the majesty of our Earth\u2019s natural cycles and patterns, and find out what\nsmall efforts each of us can make\nto care for our home \u2014 starting right here in Utah. You can learn it all (and more) in NHMU\u2019s newest special exhibition,\nMysteries of the Ice Ages\n, which opens Saturday, June 7, 2025.

The console wars have been running rampant for decades now, but there have been some major changes this past generation. We\u2019ve begun to see more platform holders like Xbox and PlayStation putting their games on other platforms. PlayStation has supported PC, but has also experimented with Nintendo Switch with\nLEGO Horizon Adventures\n. It seems like PlayStation\u2019s primary focus is its own consoles and PC, but Xbox is taking a very different approach. Xbox is putting its games pretty much everywhere, including PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s a huge departure from how platform holders typically operate, but a move that may be absolutely necessary.\nWith all of that said, some Xbox fans are upset that this isn\u2019t more transactional. PlayStation fans are eating good and getting a lot of great Xbox games like\nGears of War\n, but Xbox fans aren\u2019t getting the same thing in return. MLB The Show is the closest thing they\u2019ve got, but that was a decision made by MLB itself and less so PlayStation. However, the tides may be turning in some way. There have been some rumors that the next X\nbox console will feature Steam\nin some capacity, potentially allowing Xbox players the chance to play PlayStation games on Xbox. Although we still likely have a few years to go before that happens, another alternative is coming.\nAt Xbox\u2019s summer showcase, the company\nannounced an Xbox handheld\nin partnership with ASUS. The two companies are coming together to make an\nXbox version of its ROG Ally\nhandheld which has been competing with Steam Deck for some time now. This will allow users to have a PC handheld that natively runs Xbox PC/Play Anywhere games, utilize Xbox Game Pass, and be connected to the Xbox ecosystem.\nHowever, it can also run Steam and other PC platforms like Epic Games Store. It\u2019s a very versatile device. YouTuber Destin Legarie got to go hands-on with the device and confirmed that he was able to install PlayStation\u2019s\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales\nfrom his Steam library on the device. This means you should be able to download other PlayStation games on PC such as\nThe Last of Us\nand\nGod of War\n. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to those who are familiar with these kinds of devices, but it does indicate that Xbox is doing a lot to make itself available everywhere and connect all these gaming ecosystems as much as possible.\nYou sure about that\nhttps://t.co/drK5khnyEc\npic.twitter.com/bBcH6Kck8C\n\u2014 Joey\n(@JohanzelV)\nJune 9, 2025\nPlayStation has made a lot of its best games available on PC, though there are some games and franchises that have yet to make the jump. This could be the start of something really interesting if Xbox continues down this path and does manage to get Steam running on its next console.\nWhat do you think of this?

The program, which ran for a grand total of two seasons, features a self-contained story in each episode. Every series installment, of course, boasts a bona fide master of horror at the helm. Filmmakers like Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli,\nJohn Carpenter\n, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Stuart Gordon, Larry Cohen, and more all directed episodes. While many of the hour-long short films produced as installments of the series live in infamy, none is steeped in more controversy than\nTakashi Miike\n\u2019s \u201cImprint.\u201d\n\u201dImprint\u201d was earmarked as the 13th episode of Season 1 of\nMasters of Horror\n. The original aim was to run the episode on January 27, 2006; ultimately, though, the powers that be at Showtime decided against airing the episode.\nWhy Is\nMasters of Horror\u2019s\n\u201cImprint\u201d Episode So Controversial?\nMiike\u2019s episode is based on the novel\nBokke e, ky\u014dt\u0113\nby Shimako Iwai. His screen adaptation includes graphic depictions of aborted fetuses, along with incest and other decidedly taboo themes that Showtime determined weren\u2019t suitable for broadcast, even on premium television.\nShowrunner Mick Garris revealed in a 2022 interview with\nDread Central\nthat the network gave him a series of parameters that each episode had to exist within. Showtime told Garris that they wouldn\u2019t sign off on frontal male nudity, adults killing children, or adults engaging in sex acts with minors, along with a couple of other directives Garris doesn\u2019t explicitly name. The showrunner reveals that while Miike\u2019s episode violates none of the taboos marked as off-limits by the network, the powers that be at Showtime still couldn\u2019t bring themselves to air it. According to Garris, the suits were \u201cfreaked out by its intensity.\u201d\nWhile it might seem like banning the episode from broadcast would be detrimental to Miike\u2019s career, many fans say the decision had the exact opposite effect. In cases like this, censorship has the potential to play on our curiosity, making us want to seek out that which has been rendered too taboo for our consumption. This tendency is especially true among horror fans. Many of us are drawn to the genre because we like the extreme, and we enjoy subversive art that challenges the status quo. Facing heavy themes in a safe space has the potential for catharsis, after all.\nIndustry Entertainment / Showtime\nFollowing Showtime\u2019s decision to pull the episode from broadcast, \u201cImprint\u201d eventually debuted on DVD on September 26, 2006, allowing people to draw their own conclusions on the controversial episode. Speaking of the film\u2019s physical media release, Walmart fanned the flames when they took a page from Showtime\u2019s playbook and refused to distribute the episode on DVD. While that likely prevented some fans from seeing the episode, it probably inspired just as many to find a copy elsewhere and make up their own mind.\n[RELATED-\nJapanese Horror Filmmaker Takashi Miike Has a Disney+ Series Arriving This Year, But There\u2019s A Catch\n]\nIn the years since various bans were imposed, \u201cImprint\u201d has emerged as a fan-favorite series installment, particularly for those fond of Miike\u2019s decidedly extreme style. The controversial episode is set in the 1800s and follows Christopher (Billy Drago), an American who returns to Japan with designs on reconnecting with Komomo (Michi\u00e9), a sex worker he fell in love with and previously promised to bring back to the States with him. Following his return to Japan, Christopher is devastated to learn that Komomo has perished. Worse yet, a fellow sex worker tells him that Komomo killed herself when he didn\u2019t return as quickly as he\u2019d promised.\nAll things considered, \u201cImprint\u201d features some really controversial themes and will likely be hard for many viewers to stomach. With that said, those with a strong stomach and a high threshold for gore should consider giving the film a shot. Sometimes subversive art resonates in a way that safer fare does not.

One such book is\nAbsolute Green Lantern\n, which is changing everything we thought we knew about the will-powered space defenders. Not only is the green level of light behaving completely differently from the Green Lantern rings of the main universe, but instead of the ring just choosing the person most qualified to wield it, the Absolute Universe has Abin Sur casting his judgement on everyone. Whoever fails his test, he zaps with his unstoppable green light, seemingly killing them. One of DC\u2019s best Green Lanterns just met this fate, as John Stewart was completely consumed by the light. But does that mean he\u2019s gone for good? I don\u2019t think so.\nAbin Sur Has Judged John Stewart\nAbin Sur descended from the stars in\nAbsolute Green Lantern\n#1, bringing with him the Green Lantern that put up a nearly impenetrable forcefield around Evergreen, Nevada. It trapped the residents of the town inside, with Abin Sur saying that their judgement was commencing. Whenever someone would take some kind of important action, such as when\nGuy Gardner told everyone to stand down\nand listen to what Abin Sur had to say, he would blast them with a burst of green light, and when it cleared there would be nothing left. He would declare them judged and fly away, leaving everyone in a terror at what they could possibly do to survive first contact with an unstoppable alien force.\n[RELATED:\n85 Years Later, the Original Green Lantern is Still Iconic\n]\nJohn Stewart was one of the calmest hostages, preferring to think rationally about what Abin Sur wanted, and how they could all get out of here alive. He investigated the site of three bikers who crashed into the forcefield when it first arrived, and how despite the fact that they were nothing but bloody stains and vulture food, one of their rings made it through. After some trial and error, he realized that\ngold and anything that looks like gold can pierce the barrier\n. However, he also concluded that this wasn\u2019t what Abin Sur wanted them to learn, as if they were being judged they must have been meant to show or learn something from the experience. Before he can come to any other conclusions, Abin Sur appears and says John has been judged. He is consumed in the flame-like green light, and Abin sure flies away once again.\nFrom this, Hal concluded that the only way that any of them were going to escape with their lives was if someone took down Abin Sur. Against Jo\u2019s pleas, he walked off, and started coating bullets with gold to take down their alien captor. Of course, this would eventually lead us to the present-day events, but right now we need to talk about John Stewart, because I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s dead, and Guy Gardner might not be either.\nAbin Sur Wants Them To Overcome Their Fear\nKilling off just Guy Gardner is one thing, it\u2019s a great way to set the stakes, but also immediately killing off John Stewart? Something doesn\u2019t seem right about that, and especially not with the way John died. When Abin Sur blasted Guy, it was only after Guy overcame his fear of what Abin Sur might do to try and reach out a hand in peace. Similarly, when he attacked John, it was after John learned what he did and came to the conclusion that the test they were under wasn\u2019t something to be feared. In fact, John smiled as he was consumed, like he wasn\u2019t afraid of his fate at all. This could mean that he realized this judgement is all about letting go of fear, and once he did, he knew he would pass and survive. Abin Sur never reveals what the fate of those who are judged is, just that they have been. Coupling that with his references to the green level of light, this could easily mean that John and everyone else who is judged are transported to a different plane where the emotional spectrum light they correspond to lies. Also, when John is hit they light makes a FWASSHH sound. That\u2019s not a disintegration sound, that\u2019s a transport sound. That\u2019s onomatopeia 101!\nSo what does this mean? Well, as much as Jo seems to be the only Green Lantern that we\u2019ve seen so far, we\u2019ve also seen that\nHal becomes a Black Lantern of sorts, being the Black Hand\n. This could be a result of Hal killing Abin Sur and interrupting the judgement, with the rest of the people he meant to avenge now trapped in between levels of light. If John and Guy really are alive, then we could definitely see them return, infused with the same green light that powers Jo. It\u2019s definitely an interesting theory, and one that I am really hoping is true. As cool as killing off two beloved characters is, I can\u2019t see them staying dead for long with all the clues we\u2019ve been left with. But what do you think? Are they alive or dead?

The remarks, made during talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, surprised many. Yet they closely reflect Indonesia\u2019s broader strategic ambition:\nto join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n.\nFor years, Israel\u2014a member of the OECD\u2014has reportedly\nblocked\nIndonesia\u2019s accession, citing the absence of diplomatic ties. Now, with Jakarta eager to elevate its global standing and strengthen economic relationships with the West, a question looms: Should Indonesia trade its decades-long commitment to Palestinian rights for the prestige and potential benefits of OECD membership?\nIndonesia has long been a consistent and principled advocate for Palestinian self-determination. That position is not mere posturing\u2014it is grounded in the country\u2019s anti-colonial identity and moral commitments. Since its founding, Indonesia has refused to normalise relations with Israel, viewing its occupation of Palestinian land and repeated military campaigns in Gaza and the West Bank as incompatible with international justice.\nTo reverse that position now\u2014particularly while Israel continues a devastating campaign in Gaza\u2014would signal a betrayal of these long-held values. It would also risk undermining Indonesia\u2019s standing in the Muslim world and among nations in the Global South that have long looked to Jakarta as a moral voice in global affairs.\nCritics of Indonesia\u2019s policy argue that normalisation with Israel is the cost of entry to the OECD. But that is a false choice. Several OECD members, including\nTurkey\nand\nMexico\n, maintain complicated or strained relationships with Israel while retaining full membership. There is no reason Indonesia cannot pursue the same path: engaging with the OECD while holding firm to its commitment to Palestinian rights.\nIndeed, accession to the OECD could be a powerful platform for Indonesia\u2014not to silence its principles, but to project them. From within the organisation, Indonesia could push for greater scrutiny of member states\u2019 positions on occupation and apartheid, challenge prevailing double standards, and advocate for justice in global governance. It could use its voice to call out the complicity of powerful countries and demand accountability for ongoing violations of international law.\nThe OECD should not be treated as a reward for political alignment, but as a forum for constructive engagement. If Indonesia joins on the condition that it compromises its moral foundation, its membership will be hollow.\nThe broader problem is the international community\u2019s continued commitment to a two-state solution\u2014a model that has long failed Palestinians. The facts on the ground, including the unchecked expansion of Israeli settlements and the fragmentation of Palestinian land, make the vision of two viable, sovereign states increasingly implausible.\nIndonesia, with its legacy of anti-colonial resistance and principled diplomacy, has the credibility to challenge the outdated two-state framework. It should advocate for a rights-based approach that guarantees equality, dignity, and justice for Palestinians. Whether through a single democratic state or another inclusive model; any viable solution must start with the recognition that the current status quo is untenable.\nPrabowo\u2019s statement raises a deeper concern: the risk of transactional diplomacy displacing principled foreign policy. The Indonesian people, by and large, remain steadfast in their support for Palestine. Any move toward normalisation with Israel would likely provoke a public backlash and raise questions about democratic accountability at home.\nInternational legitimacy cannot be bought through silence or moral compromise. It must be earned by standing firm in the face of injustice. Indonesia\u2019s foreign policy has historically exemplified this principle, from its leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement to its outspoken defence of oppressed peoples. That legacy must not be discarded for short-term political or economic advantage.\nIndonesia\u2019s true influence in the world has never stemmed from wealth or military might. It has come from moral clarity and bold leadership. If the country seeks a place among the world\u2019s most developed economies, it should do so on its own terms\u2014without abandoning the values that have long defined its role on the global stage.\nThe world does not need another silent bystander. It needs countries willing to speak hard truths. That is the Indonesia the world respects\u2014and the one its people deserve.", "ped_digest": "P:Indonesia may consider recognizing Israel in exchange for Israel recognizing Palestinian statehood|Indonesia's accession to the OECD has been reportedly blocked by Israel|Indonesia should not compromise its commitment to Palestinian rights for OECD membership|Indonesia can engage with the OECD while holding firm to its commitment to Palestinian rights|Indonesia could use OECD membership to advocate for justice and challenge double standards|The two-state solution has failed Palestinians|Indonesia should advocate for a rights-based approach guaranteeing equality and justice for Palestinians|Transactional diplomacy risks displacing principled foreign policy|Indonesia's influence stems from moral clarity and bold leadership;E:Talks between Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and French President Emmanuel Macron|Indonesia's pursuit of OECD membership|Israel's reported blocking of Indonesia's OECD accession|Indonesia's long-standing advocacy for Palestinian self-determination|Continued Israeli military campaigns in Gaza and the West Bank|Expansion of Israeli settlements|Fragmentation of Palestinian land|Prabowo's statement regarding Israel recognition;D:Indonesia seeks to join the OECD|Israel is a member of the OECD|Turkey and Mexico maintain complicated relationships with Israel while being OECD members|Indonesia has historically refused to normalize relations with Israel|Indonesia's legacy of anti-colonial resistance|Indonesia's role in the Non-Aligned Movement;", "er_digest": "N:Prabowo Subianto|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Emmanuel Macron;R:Indonesia|Turkey|Israel|Mexico;", "gist": "P:Indonesia may consider recognizing Israel in exchange for Israel recognizing Palestinian statehood|Indonesia's accession to the OECD has been reportedly blocked by Israel|Indonesia should not compromise its commitment to Palestinian rights for OECD membership|Indonesia can engage with the OECD while holding firm to its commitment to Palestinian rights|Indonesia could use OECD membership to advocate for justice and challenge double standards|The two-state solution has failed Palestinians|Indonesia should advocate for a rights-based approach guaranteeing equality and justice for Palestinians|Transactional diplomacy risks displacing principled foreign policy|Indonesia's influence stems from moral clarity and bold leadership;E:Talks between Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and French President Emmanuel Macron|Indonesia's pursuit of OECD membership|Israel's reported blocking of Indonesia's OECD accession|Indonesia's long-standing advocacy for Palestinian self-determination|Continued Israeli military campaigns in Gaza and the West Bank|Expansion of Israeli settlements|Fragmentation of Palestinian land|Prabowo's statement regarding Israel recognition;D:Indonesia seeks to join the OECD|Israel is a member of the OECD|Turkey and Mexico maintain complicated relationships with Israel while being OECD members|Indonesia has historically refused to normalize relations with Israel|Indonesia's legacy of anti-colonial resistance|Indonesia's role in the Non-Aligned Movement;N:Prabowo Subianto|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Emmanuel Macron;R:Indonesia|Turkey|Israel|Mexico;", "entities": ["Prabowo Subianto", "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development", "Emmanuel Macron"], "regions": ["Indonesia", "Turkey", "Israel", "Mexico"]}, {"_id": "https://bangkoklocal.info/2025/06/09/child-forced-to-sell-juice-until-1am-sparks-outcry/", "content": "A nine-year-old girl was rescued after being forced to sell orange juice late into the night in Bangkok, prompting a police investigation and renewed concerns over child exploitation, authorities confirmed following a complaint filed on May 11.\nThe child, identified only as Miss A, was allegedly taken from her mother at age two by her mother\u2019s former partner, who falsely registered himself as her father. The mother, 28-year-old Ms. Noi, said she initially allowed the arrangement due to financial strain and promises of a stable upbringing. However, she later discovered her daughter had been denied education, proper food, and adequate rest, while being compelled to sell juice from early evening until 1:00 a.m.\nAccording to the complaint lodged through the Pavena Foundation for Children and Women, the girl faced abuse if she failed to meet nightly sales quotas. The situation came to light after a relative spotted the child in the Suksawat area and brought her home. The girl expressed a desire to return to her mother and reported being barred from school. However, the former partner reportedly reclaimed her shortly after, striking the child in public before taking her away.\nEfforts to track the child had been hindered by the former partner\u2019s frequent relocations. A separate report to the Pavena Foundation linked him to another case involving a different young girl being made to sell juice in the Bukkhlo area.\nFollowing the recent developments, police at Phra Pradaeng station questioned the man, identified as Mr. Bank, after intervention by child welfare officials.

His history is rich and his stories are many and at any time a reader can go to the current DC line up and find numerous Batman or Batman-centered books telling different stories about the iconic Dark Knight and those who inhabit his world. There is also rarely a shortage of books that want to peek into his early years to show more about what makes Batman tick, but\nBatman: Dark Patterns\nfrom\nwriter Dan Watters and Hayden Sherman has proven over its first two arcs to not be that sort of book. The book, which debuted last December and is set to kick off its third fully contained story arc this week with issue #7, is a completely different sort of beast. Instead, while\nDark Patterns\ndoes take readers back to an earlier time in Batman\u2019s career, these self-contained mysteries are actually less about Gotham City\u2019s protector and more about Gotham City itself. It\u2019s a unique approach to Batman stories, one that may be the most\nenriching take to the vigilante and his world to date\n\u2014 one that makes the first two arcs and the upcoming third a must read for Batman fans.\nDark Patterns\nis structured around four, self-contained and street level Batman mysteries. The \u201cself-contained\u201d aspect is key; you can hop in and any time and over the course of just three issues get a full story, no need for an extensive history with the character or even to have read the one before it to come away satisfied \u2014 though small details about some characters do stack. The first arc, \u201cWe Are Wounded\u201d sees a series of increasingly horrifying murders in Gotham City that have the police stumped, which is where\nBatman comes in to try to sort things out\n, solve the mystery, and try to bring some calm and resolution to the already superstitious and rattled people of Gotham. The second arc, \u201cThe Voice of the Tower\u201d, takes things in a different direction, seemingly making the people of Gotham the villain and the cops a target with a hostage situation in a Gotham high-rise set to be destroyed and the people not willing to give up their homes. Of course, it\u2019s Gotham and nothing is every that straight forward, which is something that Batman learns very quickly when he jumps into the fray and something more psychological and perhaps terrifying emerges.\n[RELATED:\n10 Things Everyone Gets Wrong About Batman\n]\nDark Patterns\nIs More About Gotham and Less About Batman (And That\u2019s a Good Thing)\nIf you noticed in my spoiler free descriptions of the first two story arcs that I\u2019m talking less about Batman and more about Gotham, that\u2019s by design. While\nDark Patterns\nis a book of Batman mysteries, these are stories about Gotham City and its people. Batman just happens to be a part of that landscape. If you look at the majority of major Batman stories and books, the threats he faces within them are going after him somewhat directly in some capacity with Gotham City usually ending up as some degree of collateral damage. Batman\u2019s foes may attack the city or various citizens, but they are doing it in provocation of the Bat. This is something that, to a degree, holds true in many stories set in the hero\u2019s early years as well but that is not the case with\nDark Patterns\n. The gruesome murders of \u201cWe Are Wounded\u201d and the terrifying hostage situation of \u201cThe Voice of the Tower\u201d are crimes against the people by the people simply because this is Gotham.\nThis perspective shift is key. We are frequently simply told that Gotham is rotten to its core, but this shows us that what is more accurate is that Gotham is merely a city of suffering where the cries have gone unheard for so long that there\u2019s almost no hope. These aren\u2019t people who have given up, as we are so often expected to believe. The people of Gotham just don\u2019t have anyone fighting with them. As readers understand, Batman never really becomes the much-needed ally of the people exactly; Dark Patterns shows the newly minted vigilante as starting to fight for the city but not alongside its people and we know that he will eventually become as much of a pain point for Gotham as his hero status rises as anything else the citizens endure now. But each story thus far is giving Batman a lesson in the nature of what he\u2019s really fighting for \u2014 and it\u2019s a good reset for fans to be reminded that the real villains in Gotham aren\u2019t Batman\u2019s elaborate rogues. It\u2019s the pain and suffering of the city.\nDark Patterns\nIs Also Carving a Path Towards Batman as We Know Him\nBut while each individual arc in\nDark Patterns\nis really about Gotham City, the stories are also quietly carving a path leading us to the Batman we know later in his career. There is a pattern in the common violence in Gotham City and as we head into the third arc kicking off in issue #7, \u201cPareidolia\u201d that bigger pattern starts to emerge and the focus feels like it is beginning to shift towards Batman and his relationship with Gotham and its crime. It\u2019s a fascinating element of the story. The seasoned Batman of his many main continuity stories is a massive, central figure. Despite his dark suit and his functional stealth, Batman isn\u2019t exactly working from the shadows anymore. In\nDark Patterns\n, he is. He is still on rooftops, behind doors, lurking, watching. He\u2019s outside the conflict and even if he manages to stop the immediate incident, there isn\u2019t complete resolution \u2014 neither \u201cWe Are Wounded\u201d nor \u201cThe Voice of the Tower\u201d really end neatly. The deeper we get into the individual arcs of\nDark Patterns\n, however, we start to see that Batman is being more directly lured out. Previews for this week\u2019s\nBatman: Dark Patterns\n#7 see him recognizing that the fires in the city may be intended for him. This more than anything marks a shift in his development and it will be fascinating to see if this is the point where the story \u2014 and indeed Batman himself \u2014 becomes less about Gotham and more about the man in the mask.\nBy leaning into an \u201cearly years\u201d story that sets its focus on the city and not the vigilante,\nBatman: Dark Patterns\noffers up what might be the most interesting and insightful Batman story to date. Less about mechanics and more about the mind and soul of everyone involved,\nDark Patterns\nis embracing the most interesting thing about DC\u2019s most iconic hero \u2014 and it is\nexactly what Batman fans need now more than ever.\nThe first two arcs of\nBatman: Dark Patterns\nare available now. Arc three, \u201cPareidolia\u201d, kicks off in\nBatman: Dark Patterns\n#7 on June 11th.\nThe post\nBatman: Dark Patterns Is the Best Dark Knight Story Yet (& You Should Be Reading It)\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Unique approach to Batman stories|Most enriching take to the vigilante and his world|Self-contained mysteries|Focus on Gotham City itself|Batman's early years|Good reset for fans|Insightful Batman story|E:Series debuted last December|Third arc kicks off this week with issue #7|First arc: \"We Are Wounded\"|Second arc: \"The Voice of the Tower\"|Third arc: \"Pareidolia\" kicks off June 11th|D:Four self-contained and street level Batman mysteries|Murders in Gotham City|Hostage situation in a Gotham high-rise|Batman is a part of Gotham's landscape|Batman's foes attack the city|Batman never really becomes the much-needed ally of the people|;", "er_digest": "N:Batman|Hayden Sherman|Dan Watters|DC;R:Gotham City;", "gist": "P:Unique approach to Batman stories|Most enriching take to the vigilante and his world|Self-contained mysteries|Focus on Gotham City itself|Batman's early years|Good reset for fans|Insightful Batman story|E:Series debuted last December|Third arc kicks off this week with issue #7|First arc: \"We Are Wounded\"|Second arc: \"The Voice of the Tower\"|Third arc: \"Pareidolia\" kicks off June 11th|D:Four self-contained and street level Batman mysteries|Murders in Gotham City|Hostage situation in a Gotham high-rise|Batman is a part of Gotham's landscape|Batman's foes attack the city|Batman never really becomes the much-needed ally of the people|N:Batman|Hayden Sherman|Dan Watters|DC;R:Gotham City;", "entities": ["Batman", "Hayden Sherman", "Dan Watters", "DC"], "regions": ["Gotham City"]}, {"_id": "https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/06/09/arkansas-lawmakers-give-initial-approval-to-new-state-insurance-captives-rate-structure/", "content": "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders tours tornado-damaged Wynne High School on April 2, 2023. (Randall Lee/Arkansas Governor's Office)\nA legislative committee on Monday granted preliminary permission for officials to move forward with proposed rates for Arkansas\u2019 new state property insurance program, the result of nearly two years of work aimed at developing a plan to control rising insurance premiums for schools.\nFollowing the recommendation of consultants to create the State Captive Insurance Program, an insurance company owned by the state, lawmakers this year passed\nAct 560\nand\nAct 779\nand approved contracts with vendors to run the self-insurance program.\nUnder the newly approved legislation, the captive will be formed by July 1 and apply to buildings and property owned by a public school, state-supported institution of higher education or the state.\nDuring the Arkansas Legislative Council\u2019s Executive Subcommittee meeting\nMonday\n, Crossett Republican and panel chair Sen. Ben Gilmore recognized everyone who has been involved with forming the captive, which \u201chas been quite the process.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we acknowledge where we started and where we are now, and this is coming to an end\u2026\nwhat we did is something we should acknowledge is very big with the State Captive Insurance Program,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cSo we are on to the next step with that, and I appreciate your involvement, and we\u2019ll continue to work and make this successful.\u201d\nInsurance premiums have been increasing nationwide due to more frequent natural disasters, additional legal liability from more lawsuits and the growing frequency of cybercrimes, according to\nEducation Week\n.\nArkansas firm recommends plan for controlling schools\u2019 increasing insurance rates\nThe issue came into focus for Arkansas in July 2023 when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the state would help school districts\ncover the cost\nof rising insurance premiums. State lawmakers approved a request from the Arkansas Insurance Department to transfer $10.8 million from the state\u2019s restricted reserve account to offset the cost of increased premiums.\nThe funding was split three ways \u2014 $6.3 million for the 170 districts in the Arkansas School Boards Association-managed program, $4.46 million for the 68 districts in the Arkansas Public School Insurance Trust (which is managed by the Insurance Department), and nearly $118,000 for the Bentonville School District, which procured insurance directly through the open market.\nKyle Hales, a principal consulting actuary at\nPerr & Knight\n,\ntold the committee\nMonday\nthat the total cost of premiums for the three agencies approximately tripled between 2021 and 2024 insurance renewals.\nJ.R. Bizzell, senior vice president in Stephens Insurance\u2019s risk management group, said the intent of the captive is to \u201cimprove efficiencies with purchasing reinsurance or excess property insurance,\u201d which is what the Little Rock-based firm is primarily helping obtain.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a centralized claims and underwriting component, as well as overall it should help stabilize long-term insurance costs for all of the districts, all the agencies and all the participants of this program,\u201d Bizzell said.\nFor the first year of the captive, Stephens recommends a flat rate for all participants. Premiums are calculated by multiplying the rate by building values, Bizzell said. All schools should have a flat rate, he said. If they change their value due to an assessment, or by adding or removing a building, \u201cthey will experience some level of premium change, but it should be modest in nature,\u201d he said.\nStephens also recommends that participants carry a maintenance deductible that\u2019s below the captive, Bizzell said. The deductible structure would be changed to a minimum of $25,000 per occurrence, per participant, and $50,000 per occurrence if their total insured values (i.e. asset values) are over $100 million. For state agencies, the recommendation is to move to a $250,000 flat deductible for the first year, he said.\nThe rate and deductible structure for year two is continuing to be evaluated, so Stephens made no recommendation \u201coutside of there is an expectation that deductibles need to continue to be rightsided and that detail will come in the future,\u201d Bizzell said.\nStephens has been coordinating with the Legislature as well as the newly created\nOffice of Property Risk\n, which will be managing the program after July 1, Bizzell said. In the coming weeks, all participants will receive a summary of their expected premium and deductible, he said.\nThe subcommittee authorized Stephens to move forward with its proposed rate and deductible structure and for the Arkansas Legislative Council\u2019s co-chairs to approve that direction by emergency action.\nThe new rates and deductibles will be effective for the 2025-2026 academic year, if they receive final approval from the Arkansas State Board of Finance and ALC, Bureau of Legislative Research Director Marty Garrity told the Advocate. They\u2019re scheduled to meet on\nJune 12\nand\nJune 20\n, respectively.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nSUPPORT", "ped_digest": "P:State Captive Insurance Program aims to control rising insurance premiums for schools|New legislation establishes a state-owned insurance company to stabilize long-term insurance costs|Program will cover buildings and property owned by public schools and state-supported institutions|Rates and deductibles will be effective for the 2025-2026 academic year;E:Gov.

However, rising demand and capacity costs in\nPJM\nand\nMISO\nhave caused some worries in New England about looming data center-driven load growth.\nEven without a significant amount of increased demand from data centers,\nISO-NE\nforecasts the region\u2019s peak load to roughly double by 2050 due to heating and transportation electrification, which would require the region to add a massive amount of new generation and transmission capacity.\nThe RTO estimates the region will need to add about 97 GW of clean energy capacity to meet state decarbonization goals. (See\nISO-NE Prices Transmission Upgrades Needed by 2050: up to $26B\nand\nISO-NE Study Lays Out Challenges of Deep Decarbonization\n.)\nRepresentatives of companies developing large-scale data centers said they are not currently developing projects in the region, citing the high cost of power.\nWhat drives interest in data centers is \u201cwhere is there existing power and where are there existing customers,\u201d said Judith Judson, senior vice president at Vantage Data Centers.\n\u201cIn terms of operating costs, power really matters, and the price of power comes in substantially,\u201d Judson said. \u201cPower prices in the Northeast happen to be higher than in other parts of the country. But that doesn\u2019t mean that this isn\u2019t an area for growth.\u201d\nWhile load growth from data centers has yet to show up in New England, both Massachusetts and Connecticut have passed tax incentives in recent years to boost development. Massachusetts lawmakers in 2024 passed a bill exempting data centers from the state\u2019s sales tax, while Connecticut\nallows\ndata center developers to apply for an up-to-30-year sales and property tax exemption.\nThese incentives appear to have spurred some increased interest in data center development. In Western Massachusetts, the Westmass Area Development Corporation\naims to build\na $3 billion data center complex, though the not-for-profit development group has yet to announce anchor tenants for the project. In Connecticut, Dominion Energy has received\nrequests\nfrom developers to co-locate data center facilities at the site of the Millstone nuclear plant.\n\u201cThe amount of service requests we have in our service territory exceeds the peak load of Maine and New Hampshire combined, [though] we don\u2019t know if these are real or speculative,\u201d said Vandan Divatia, vice president at Eversource Energy. \u201cWe can enable some of these resources in a very strategic and measured way in various locations throughout our system.\u201d\nMorgan Steacy, vice president of connections and strategic accounts at National Grid, said the company has seen \u201csome incremental growth\u201d in data center connection requests after Massachusetts passed its incentives in 2024.\n\u201cWill we ever house hyperscalers? If I had to bet, no,\u201d Steacy said, adding that the state could see continued interest in smaller data center applications.\u00a0She encouraged companies to reach out if they are interested in developing in the state, and said National Grid can help companies navigate the permitting and siting process.\nPotential for Demand Flexibility\n\u201cThe data center industry is not monolithic,\u201d said Lucas Fykes, director of energy policy at the Data Center Coalition, noting that the potential for demand response will vary significantly between different facilities.\nHe said demand response capabilities often depend on whether a data center is a single- or multi-tenant facility and said it can be easier to reduce the load of a single-tenant facility, when the tenant can shift demand to a different facility.\nBrendon Baatz, who works in energy market development at Google, said some of the company\u2019s data centers have demand response capabilities and that it is working to shift loads between facilities to minimize its overall emissions impact. He said this strategy is a key aspect of meeting the company\u2019s goal of matching all its power demand with carbon-free energy on an hourly basis by 2030.\nJudson of Vantage Data Centers said peak shifting \u201cisn\u2019t so much available\u201d for the company\u2019s facilities but added that \u201con very hot peak days, we can shift some to backup generation to take some of the load off the grid.\u201d\nUltimately, as data centers come online, the facilities should not be treated any differently than other large sources of load, several speakers urged.\n\u201cIt should be a very large customer tariff,\u201d said Judson, who warned against overbearing interconnection requirements and called for collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders to establish rules for interconnecting data centers in a way that will both \u201cserve our needs and protect ratepayers.\u201d\n\u201cThe answer to the question of whether we need a data center tariff is absolutely not,\u201d said Baatz. \u201cI do not think it needs to be specific to data centers, because there are other large loads coming onto the grid, and those should not be treated any differently than data centers.\u201d\n(For

about time\nJune 1, 2025\nWhat does the \u201cideal\u201d day look like?\nNot the perfect day e.g. I just won the state lottery and then a series of amazing events happened. I mean if you could follow through on any plan, then what would your schedule look like?\nFor an elite athlete that probably means a lot of training mixed with good nutrition and sleep. For a working parent that could mean a good balance between the office and family time.\nOf course the definition of the \u201cideal\u201d day changes based on the week, month and year. You can\u2019t just copy and paste the same day every day.\nA thought experiment\nThe \u201cideal\u201d minute, hour, day, etc. can be discovered by asking yourself, \u201cwhat is the best use of my time at this very moment?\u201c. Though it\u2019s not always clear what the right answer is.\nTake these two example days for instance.\nOption 1:\nTime\nActivity\n9:00 AM - 5:00 PM\nWork\n5:30 PM - 6:30 PM\nGym\n6:45 PM - 7:45 PM\nDinner\n8:00 PM - 11:00 PM\nChill\nOption 2:\nTime\nActivity\n9:00 AM - 6:00 PM\nWork\n6:30 PM - 7:30 PM\nGym\n7:45 PM - 8:45 PM\nDinner\n9:00 PM - 11:00 PM\nChill\nThe only difference is we work one hour longer and chill one hour less. Which version of this day is better? Well it depends right. What does \u201cbetter\u201d mean to you?\nIf you could go back and make edits to how you spend your days, would you shift things or keep everything as is? Many people I talk to say they wish they spent more time on X. I\u2019d spend less time on Y, usually social media.\nWe all simultaneously have this feeling, yet we aren\u2019t deliberate with how we spend our time. Usually we wait\nfor a new years resolutions, an epiphany or a life event to change our strategy.\nSeeing time\nThe problem is that the human brain isn\u2019t great at perceiving time. Imagine making financial decisions without knowing how much money you\u2019ve been spending. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your bank account.\nTo adjust to this world you think about your big purchases and subtract from your paycheck. That gives you a good start. You make a guess at the other general expenses but it\u2019s hard to tell how much you\u2019re exactly saving.\nThe general sense is enough to get through the day to day without hitting zero, but saving for a home seems incredibly difficult. You\u2019re just not sure if you\u2019re on track or not and at that point is it worth trying for? You\u2019re practically guessing for an event that\u2019s potentially 10+ years away.\nWhen you can see the hard numbers, planning becomes easier. That plan can give you the confidence to make adjustments to the rest of your life and get closer to your goal. For example, taking on a roommate to save extra money for a home later on. Without it long term goals can feel like just a wish.\nTime is similar to money. Many of us approach life one day at a time, which is great, but it makes long term planning difficult. If we had perfect \u201cvision\u201d of our time, maybe we\u2019d see that two hours a day will convert into a big break four years later.\nI think we subconsciously know this. Human beings crave perception of their time. When we pay attention, we can find many examples of this in technology.\nExamples\nSpotify Wrapped\nRemember when this dropped for the first time? People loved it. Once it became a trend I wonder if people listened to some artists more/less to influence their wrapped for the year.\nApple\u2019s Screen Time\nIt\u2019s a a rite of passage to view your screen time and get shocked by the numbers. Our apps are like a part time job. This feature certainly influenced what apps I keep installed.\nStrava\nFor new runners, Strava keeps us going. It makes all the work we put in feel more \u201creal\u201d.\nSnapchat Memories\nIt\u2019s always fun to look back and see something and say \u201cWow I\u2019ve changed a lot over the years. That\u2019s what I used to do?\u201c.\nThere\u2019s a common theme between these features. Many of us are surprised by the actual data. Like, \u201cOh wow that was my top artist on Spotify?\u201d or \u201cWoah that memory was already 5 years ago?\u201c. It\u2019s pleasurable to understand our lives a bit better.\nReflection\nThe beauty of modern software is pixels on a screen can get our brain to understand how we\u2019re spending our life e.g. 50,000 minutes listening to music this year.\nWe all want more control over how our lives play out. What\u2019s missing is the foundation of data (time data specifically) to help us understand and reflect better.\nWhat working professionals end up doing in the modern world is rely on their managers, leadership and performance reviews to have facilitate that reflection process for them. That may work but it takes away autonomy and then what about our personal lives? We may have personal goal that\u2019s the size of home ownership that feels like it\u2019s out of reach.\nOur brains are actually pretty smart and good at solving problems. The issue is that the modern world has a lot of distractions. With the right information our problems almost solve themselves. Take this\nreview\nof 22 weight loss studies. It shows that monitoring one\u2019s weight is a core mechanism for behavior change. People made better choices with the right data.\nUnlike money or weight, time has an extra dimension that makes it challenging. It\u2019s not just a single number like dollars or pounds. It\u2019s a combination of time spent and the results of spending that time.\nLet\u2019s go back to the thought experiment. The options were nine hours of work vs. eight hours of work, but what if the same amount of work got done because you hit your mental limit at eight? Now option two is clearly better. Time needs to be coupled with results to give it meaning.\nTo get the most out of reflection we need to think about how we spend our time as well as how we feel about the time spent.\nSolutions\nThere is no perfect solution. I have hope that technology can help, but I maintain some healthy skepticism. The answer might just be that you need to do the following: journal daily, maintain a structured calendar wake up at 5 AM, meditate, etc. However, The vast majority of society doesn\u2019t want to live like that. A life like that might be a living hell to some.\nToday, there are many tools try to help. Trello, Google Calendar, Apple Reminders, Sunsama, Things 3, Fantastical, and the list goes on. The problem with them is that the spirit of the tool is efficiency and productivity\u2014not reflection of all aspects of your life.\nProductivity is one slice of your life. Doing 20% more tasks may or may not make you feel satisfied. You need to reflect on work, but also friends, family, hobbies, health etc.\nIn the perfect world, reflection isn\u2019t something you do once a year. It\u2019s something you do constantly. It\u2019s just how you operate. You\u2019re taking in new information, reflecting and making decisions based on that.\nHere\u2019s a wish list of features that could help with that:\nNotifications that nudge you until you met your quota for different activities i.e. 10 hours of social time, 3 hours of gardening etc. It would look at your calendar to check your progress for the week.\nA wrist band that won\u2019t stop buzzing until you start moving to your destination so you\u2019re not late for your appointment. Maybe watch notifications can be configured to do this.\nZooming out of calendar gives high level break down of week/month/year. For example, this month was a grind and you never left the house. Maybe with some visuals of what the weather was like to give you a better sense of the month.\nThird party integrations. For example, Spotify, now you can actively see how your music mood changes week over week.\nA chat interface to manager your calendar. \u201cClear out my weekend\u201d or \u201cFind time for planning a large project\u201d.\nAn AI journal that suggests events on your calendar based on detected intentions.\nWhy is this important?\nAI and technology will continue to improve our lives and free up more time.

responded to user panic over a sweeping court order that requires the retention of chat logs for an indefinite period of time. This court order was\nissued after news organizations\nsuing over copyright claims accused the AI company of destroying evidence. Those organizations including The New York Times, expressed concerns that ChatGPT might be used to bypass paywalls and \u201cdelete their searches to cover their tracks.\u201d\nThe judge Ona Wang agreed that OpenAI likely would never stop deleting that alleged evidence absent a court order, and granted the news plaintiffs\u2019 request to preserve all chats.\nREAD: AI and the media: Transforming content, distribution, and editorial leadership\n(December 10, 2024)\n\u201cBefore OpenAI had an opportunity to respond to those unfounded accusations, the court ordered OpenAI to preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis until further order of the Court (in essence, the output log data that OpenAI has been destroying),\u201d OpenAI explained in a court filing demanding oral arguments in a bid to block the controversial order.\nOpenAI stated\nin the filing that the court rushed the order based on \u201ca hunch\u201d raised by The New York Times, and other news organizations. \u201cThe New York Times and other plaintiffs have made a sweeping and unnecessary demand in their baseless lawsuit against us: retain consumer ChatGPT and API customer data indefinitely. This fundamentally conflicts with the privacy commitments we have made to our users. It abandons long-standing privacy norms and weakens privacy protections,\u201d OpenAI COO Brian Lightcap\nsaid\n.\nThe company also argued the May 13 order was premature and should be vacated until \u201cat a minimum,\u201d news organizations can establish a substantial need for OpenAI to preserve all chat logs.\nOpenAI\nalso argued that there was \u201cno evidence beyond speculation,\u201d that the company had intentionally deleted data, and that there wasn\u2019t \u201ca single piece of evidence supporting\u201d claims that copyright-infringing ChatGPT users are more likely to delete their chats.\nREAD: OpenAI celebrates 12 Days of \u201cShipmas\u201d: Highlights from week 1\n(December 13, 2024)\nWang had brought up a hypothetical scenario with regard to this during a conference in January. She asked OpenAI\u2019s legal team to consider a ChatGPT user who \u201cfound some way to get around the paywall\u201d and \u201cwas getting The New York Times content somehow as the output.\u201d If that user \u201cthen hears about this case and says, \u2018Oh, whoa, you know I\u2019m going to ask them to delete all of my searches and not retain any of my searches going forward,\u2019\u201d the judge asked, wouldn\u2019t that be \u201cdirectly the problem\u201d that the order would address?\nOpenAI argued that risks of breaching privacy agreements would not only affect users, but also risk putting the company in breach of contracts and global privacy regulations. The company also stated that complying with the order would impose \u201csignificant burden\u201d on it, forcing it to spend months of engineering hours at substantial costs to comply. OpenAI stated its potential for harm far outweighs news plaintiffs\u2019 speculative need for such data.\nOpenAI also elaborated on how the sweeping court order affected users, mentioning that ChatGPT had a number of \u201chighly confidential and personal use cases.\u201d The company also clarified this affected ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users as well as users of the OpenAI API without a Zero Data Retention agreement.

"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2025/06/the-key-to-driving-government-efficiency-in-2025/", "content": "We are witnessing a significant shift in the federal landscape and civil agencies as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) works towards a healthy, prosperous, secure America. Agencies need to streamline operations, disrupt and transform outdated processes, and enhance efficiency while simultaneously cutting costs \u2014 all while driving mission-critical outcomes to protect our nation\u2019s technological supremacy.\nHaving spent more than 25 years working within government as a change agent, I have certainly observed firsthand the challenges and opportunities in driving efficiency in public sector operations. However, I\u2019ve also seen how when the right technology is applied at speed and scale, positive change is possible. Commercial technologies, matched with mission expertise, can help achieve missions with greater efficiency. AI and cyber technologies can both have immediate positive impact on speed and outcomes across the government.\nCutting costs through AI and cyber\nAI and automation are critical forces to achieve this transformation. These technologies, when implemented strategically, can deliver cost-cutting results that were inconceivable as recently as five years ago.\nIn healthcare specifically, AI-powered data analytics can drive significant cost efficiencies by streamlining patient data management and improving clinical decision-making. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which manages one of the largest healthcare systems in the country, is already benefitting greatly from AI adoption to accelerate claims processing and improve service delivery for veterans.\nThe VA\u2019s PACT Act implementation and its efforts to modernize disability claims processing exemplifies the potential of automation to drive efficiency. The VA needed a partner to tackle the unprecedented increase in disability claims that came as a result of the PACT Act, with an average claim containing 1,300 pages of documentation to review. The Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) implemented AI and automation to provide better efficiency in this tedious manual document review process, automate over 700,000 claims, and provide AI-recommend answers to key questions during the claim review process, saving hundreds of thousands of hours annually.\nSimilarly, in cybersecurity, automation-driven threat detection is helping agencies identify potential anomalies and threats more efficiently. With the right AI solutions, agencies can cut costs while enhancing their security posture. The widespread adoption of automation in security operations centers can reduce the need for manual monitoring, allowing agencies to reallocate human resources to more strategic initiatives while better protecting our nation\u2019s most critical systems with constant monitoring.\nRestructuring federal budget for financial efficiency\nWhile technology is crucial to accelerating efficiency, it\u2019s only part of the equation. Budget allocation and financial structuring play equally vital roles in finding efficiencies that will make our nation more prosperous. The federal budget process often results in fragmented funding allocation, making it difficult to achieve comprehensive, large-scale transformation initiatives.\nA more effective approach would be to consolidate disparate programs under streamlined contracts. This would enable agencies to benefit from economies of scale and reduce administrative overhead.

With\nEmpire Skate\n, we wanted to honor that energy and tell the story of how a small skate shop helped fuel a global cultural shift. This film is as much about identity and expression as it is about skating, and I\u2019m proud to help bring that story to the screen.\u201d\nThe film will premiere at the 2025 Tribeca Festival on June 12 and then on ESPN on June 30 at 9 p.m.\nET. Following the linear premiere, the film will be available to stream on ESPN+, as well as on Disney+ and Hulu.\nHere\u2019s a full synopsis\nvia ESPN\n:\n\u201cEmpire Skate\u201d tells the story of 1990\u2019s New York City skate culture that inspired the global brand Supreme. It is the scene of a rare, energetic convergence of hip-hop, street art, dance, and culture. Kids who grew up in the 1980s as outsiders, going against the grain, bring their own element to this culture: skateboarding. Many of them fleeing hard lives of dysfunction and family desperation, they turn the forbidding landscape of the city into their own personal skate park \u2013 setting the stage for a movement that would grow to transform fashion and sports.\nWhile Southern California remains the mass-market capital of skateboarding, this New York City crew creates their own style. Bolstered by charismatic kids like Harold Hunter and enthusiastic entrepreneurs, fledgling skate shops begin to appear across the city. They tap into a NYC skating vibe that is faster, more dangerous, and more improvisational than its West Coast counterpart, and the style echoes that difference: SkateNYC and Zoo York set the tone for this rise, and then another brand is birthed that changes the scene forever.\nSupreme, fronted by the mysterious businessman James Jebbia, takes NYC by storm. Playing by its own rules of marketing, store design, and customer service (including refusing to serve those who don\u2019t seem to fit its image and vibe), Supreme becomes a status symbol on the streets of Manhattan \u2013 and beyond. It becomes a global phenomenon, with buyers arriving from as far as Asia, pockets bursting with cash, eager to buy a piece of the lifestyle.\nThe rise pulls the NYC skateboarding crew into other areas of pop culture. The Larry Clark and Harmony Korine indie film Kids is a surprise hit that features several NYC skateboarders including an aspiring young actor named Justin Pierce. They find themselves on a rocket ship of fame that is impossible to navigate, and Pierce commits suicide.\nTragedy and camaraderie, changing trends in fashion and entertainment, and the constant evolution of culture continue to transform the NYC skateboarding landscape. Through it all, Supreme maintains a powerful hold, and those for whom skateboarding was an indispensable part of their lives, the bonds remain forever.\nThe post\nESPN debuts trailer for 30 for 30 doc \u2018Empire Skate\u2019\nappeared first on\nAwful Announcing\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Rise of New York skateboarding culture|Influence of Supreme|Exploration of identity and expression through skating|Impact on fashion and sports;E:Release of \"Empire Skate\" trailer|Premiere at 2025 Tribeca Festival (June 12)|ESPN premiere (June 30 at 9 p.m. ET)|Film available on ESPN+, Disney+, and Hulu;D:1990s|June 12, 2025|June 30, 2025|9 p.m. ET;", "er_digest": "N:ESPN|Josh Swade|Supreme|Tony Hawk;R:New York City|Manhattan|Kentucky|United States|Asia;", "gist": "P:Rise of New York skateboarding culture|Influence of Supreme|Exploration of identity and expression through skating|Impact on fashion and sports;E:Release of \"Empire Skate\" trailer|Premiere at 2025 Tribeca Festival (June 12)|ESPN premiere (June 30 at 9 p.m. ET)|Film available on ESPN+, Disney+, and Hulu;D:1990s|June 12, 2025|June 30, 2025|9 p.m. ET;N:ESPN|Josh Swade|Supreme|Tony Hawk;R:New York City|Manhattan|Kentucky|United States|Asia;", "entities": ["ESPN", "Josh Swade", "Supreme", "Tony Hawk"], "regions": ["New York City", "Manhattan", "Kentucky", "United States", "Asia"]}, {"_id": "https://fictionhorizon.com/dragon-ball-all-female-saiyans-ranked-by-strength/", "content": "Skip to content\nStore\nNewsletter\nDragon Ball: All 15 Female Saiyans Ranked by Strength\nBy\nArthur S.

Namely, we have already talked about the most powerful Saiyans in the series, but we haven\u2019t really talked about the female Saiyans of\nDragon Ball\n. In this article, we are going to list all the major female Saiyans (i.e., those who played a somewhat important role in the series, and not those who are simply video game fusions or have been mentioned as cameo characters in games) and rank them based on their strength.\n15.

As according to Toyotaro\u2019s interpretation of what might have happened to him and his wife Honey in Dragon Ball Super: Broly, that could have been true, but his wife tells him not to worry and that they should simply continue and search for another planet to make their vacation home. Honey and Onio traveled to Earth and decided to have their honeymoon there and establish a summer residence. In order to eliminate all humans without severely harming the environment, Onio estimates that it would take him roughly a month.\nRELATED:\nDragon Ball Super Manga Arcs & Volumes in Order\nIn\nNeko Majin Z 2\n, the second Honey (on the right) makes her debut as Thunderbolt\u2019s girlfriend.

Honey tells Thunderbolt that they should leave because this is the wrong location for a champion like him as he gets frustrated that no one is coming up to beg for his autograph. As Neko Majin Z and his companion arrived, Honey and Thunderbolt were about to make out when Neko Majin and his companion mocked them. Thunderbolt, Neko Majin\u2019s friend, notices this when he signs Thunderbolt\u2019s autograph in his\nPorry Hatter\nbook (which is a\nHarry Potter\nreference).\n14. Mizore\nThe character Mizore from\nDragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission\nassumes the identity of Fasha when she enters the\nDragon Ball Heroes\nuniverse\n. Mizore has long hair, huge eyes, and an elongated face and wears spectacles. She is a tall female. She is wearing a plain t-shirt and a hat resembling an elf with a V-shaped insignia on the front. She resembles the look of the Dr. Slump character Arale Norimaki. Later, after being ejected from Rezok\u2019s body, Haze Shenron summons Mizore to where he is and seizes possession of her. The Evil Dragon is quickly stunned by Froze, who also successfully removes Haze\u2019s dragon ball from the inside of him. She is then brought into the real world by Erito while still unconscious.\n13. Akina\nAkina is more of a gimmick character than anything else, but she is an interesting addition to this list, especially since she seems to have some crazy powers and abilities. She is present in\nDragon Ball Heroes\nand was modeled after the famous model and spokeswoman of\nSakiyomi JanBANG!\n,\u00a0Akina Minami. In the aforementioned game, she appears as a special Saiyan Hero Avatar. As we have said, despite being a gimmick character, she has various powers and abilities, including flight and numerous techniques, including Kiai, Energy Flash, Galick Gun, Death Beam, Death Ball, Kamehameha, Spirit Bomb, Innocence Cannon, and Final Explosion.\n12. Queen of the Saiyans\nThe Last Queen of the Saiyans is the mother of Vegeta and Tarble, Trunks and Bulla\u2019s paternal grandmother, and King Vegeta\u2019s wife. She is quite an enigmatic character, as nothing is known about her, and it seems that she was never even shown in any of the canon materials related to Dragon Ball. When she was 731 years old, King Vegeta appointed her as his consort. Like with practically every other Saiyan in Universe 7, she was eliminated by Frieza. We assume that she was powerful enough to be mentioned on this list due to her status in the community and the fact that King Vegeta personally picked her.\n11. Note\nNote is one of the avatars in\nDragon Ball Heroes\nand one of the main characters in\nDragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission\n. Note was ranked 3rd in the previous year\u2019s \u201cStrongest Hero\u201d national tournament, and upon seeing Beat play, she then decides to challenge him to a fight. Note uses her rare card, Super Baby 2, but in the end, she loses when Beat uses his\nSuper Saiyan 4\nGoku card. On another day, Note orders Beat to enter a tournament since he never participated. However, Note is out of the tournament due to losing the name draw. When Beat reaches the finals, Note fights with him, for despite winning, his Charge Impact is weak.\nAfter Froze defeats Erito, Note tells Beat to trade her cards, but he can\u2019t because he only brought those. Note then meets with Forte, whom she fought in the national tournament. After Froze defeats Beat in the finals, Note and Forte say that Beat lost as Froze is a fighting machine, emotionless and impossible to defeat. Forte then challenges Note to a fight, but as they are fighting, the machine is accidentally unplugged by Froze, who trips while being challenged by bullies who want to steal his cards. Note then takes down one of the bullies along with Forte, and soon Froze leaves as her parents show up.\n10. Forte\nIn the Japanese arcade game\nSuper Dragon Ball Heroes\n, a female Saiyan avatar, Forte, the Female Saiyan Berserker, is available. The Berserker Woman reportedly invaded the Dragon Ball Heroes universe, where she turned into a Saiyan, just like the Saiyan Hero and several other characters. With purple attire, fingerless gloves that extend over the elbows, black boots, and a yellow leg sleeve, Forte wears common battle armor. She wears her black hair in a bun.\nRELATED:\n29 Best \u2018Dragon Ball\u2019 Manga Panels of All Time\nShe dons a new Saiyan armor when she enters class-up mode. He currently dons an enhanced version of Vegeta\u2019s original armor with a neckline, some sort of Saiyan-style bracelets, boots akin to those worn by Raditz or other Saiyans, purple wristbands that extend past the elbows underneath the bracelets, and two sleeves for both of his legs that are the same color as the original. She keeps on donning her purple attire.\n9. Bulma Leigh\nBulma Leigh, better known as Vegeta Jr.\u2019s mother, is a figure from\nDragon Ball GT\n. She shows up a century after Yi Xing Long loses the Martial Arts Competition to support Vegeta Jr. She has Bulma\u2019s physical attributes and personality, with the exception of spikier bangs and an affinity for the color olive green.\nShe resembles Bulma and Bra in various ways. Because of this, it is possible that she is a descendant of Bulma and the granddaughter of Bra or Trunks. She briefly converses with Pan before introducing herself as the CEO of the Capsule Corporation, which she insults for being \u201ctoo old\u201d to be Goku Jr.\u2019s mother. She doesn\u2019t recognize Pan, suggesting that all ties between the Goku and Vegeta families may have vanished over the past one hundred years.\n8. Bulla\nBulla was born on February 8, a little before the 28th Tenkaichi Budokai, she doesn\u2019t show any particular skill for fighting, but that\u2019s also because she doesn\u2019t appear much in the story due to her young age. But given her origin, we can assume that she has combat abilities. In Dragon Ball GT, we also see her using her powers to give her energy to Vegeta when the latter is under Baby\u2019s control. But she is a spoiled girl who spends time shopping and idolizes her father. She is very beautiful and looks exactly like a younger version of Bulma.\nShe is\nVegeta and Bulma\u2019s daughter\nand Trunks\u2019 little sister. She is, therefore, like this last half-human half-Saiyan. Therefore, King Vegeta is her paternal grandfather, Mr. Brief is her maternal grandfather, Madame Brief is her maternal grandmother, and Table is her paternal uncle. She looked a lot like her mother when she was young. She has blue hair. In Dragon Ball Z, she wears a dress and her hair tied in a ponytail on her head. In Dragon Ball GT, her hair is loose, and she has a bob cut with a red headband. Her clothes are also red.\n7. Nion\nNion is a female Saiyan of pure blood. She was a scientist from the planet Vegeta who was entrusted with researching how infants develop and how they can fight. She first appears in the\nDragon Ball Super: Broly\nmovie\nand is a tertiary character. She has a thin frame and is a woman of average height. She has black eyes and medium-length hair that has been trimmed in a bluish-purple bowl style. In contrast to her male friends, Nion reveals to have a very cold attitude when assessing Broly\u2019s combat potential, and she never exhibits fear when facing King Vegeta. She also flashes mischievous smiles.\n6. Gine\nGine was a lowly Saiyan from Universe 7, Bardock\u2019s wife and the natural mother of Goku and Raditz. She was employed at the Meat Distribution Center on Planet Vegeta after leaving Bardock\u2019s Squad because of her submissive personality. To eventually make an appearanc\ne in the film Dragon Ball Super: Broly\n, Gine made her acting debut in\nDragon Ball Minus\n, a special chapter of the\nJaco the Galactic Patrolman\nmanga. Due to her placid and meek demeanor, Gine was not a fighter like the other members of her kind.\nRELATED:\nWhy Does Vegeta Call Goku Kakarot in Dragon Ball?\nGine, in Toriyama\u2019s opinion, was an atypical Saiyan since she felt affection and attachment toward her mate, Bardock. Gine experienced maternal emotions as she was very glad that Raditz was sent with Prince Vegeta and concerned for the safety of her youngest son, who was being banished as a flying newborn owing to the slim possibility of survival. Gine even started to cry when she saw him leaving. In an amusing tone, Bardock accuses her of giving him fatherly feelings, which are unusual for Saiyans.\n5. Pan\nPan is the daughter of Videl and Gohan, whose maternal grandparents are Mr. Satan, and the late singer Miguel, whose paternal grandparents are Goku and Chi-Chi. As the daughter of a Saiyan hybrid like her father, Gohan, and an Earthling like her mother, Videl, who makes her 1/4 Saiyan, Pan has a particularly Earthling ancestry.\nIn Dragon Ball Super, a baby named Pan is depicted as being very playful, smiling, affectionate, and hyperactive. Her parents, Videl and Gohan, constantly struggle to calm the funny little girl down. Still, Pan also appears to enjoy the affection from her parents, her grandparents, and other family members. Pan, who was only a few months old when she first learned to fly, enjoys exploring new places and getting into trouble, such as dirtying Alternative Future Trunks.\n4. Fasha\nAs a Bardock\u2019s Supreme Saiyan Squad member, Fasha is a low-class Saiyan fighter serving the Saiyan Army. Fasha is a cunning and brutal warrior, but like Bardock, Toma, and the other members of her squad, she has a strong sense of respect for and loyalty to her team. Fasha possesses 2,000 units of combat power, according to\nDragon Ball Carddass\n. Her power increases by 10 when she transforms into a big monkey, giving her 20,000 units. As long as she has her tail and there is a full moon, she can change into a huge monkey. When she and her allies attack Planet Kanassan, she is shown in this transformation.\n3.\nCaulifla\nGoku is impressed when Caulifla turns into Super Saiyan 2, which shows that with the talent, he might even turn into Super Saiyan 3 at the Tournament of Forces, but he must first master both Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2. Caulifla claims that no Saiyan had ever defeated her until encountering Cabba.\nRELATED:\nBlack Frieza vs. Beerus: Who Would Win in a Fight?\nOf dread of encountering her, several soldiers from the Sadala Defense Forces shied away from her domain. Caulifla boldly asserts that she is more talented than all of them as she talks about how the Saiyans of Universe 7 struggled to learn the Super Saiyan transformation from Cabba. As a Super Saiyan, Caulifla was able to severely hurt Frieza and demolish a significant piece of the Tournament of Power platform. When Freeza initially became Namek, she would boast that she was far more powerful than Son Goku. She can\u2019t stand a chance against Kale or\nGolden Frieza\nin their raw form.\n2. Kale\nKale, also known as the Demon Saiyan, is a female Saiyan from Universe 6\u2019s Planet Sadala, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Caulifla, and a participant in the Tournament of Strength as part of Champa\u2019s Universe 6 Team.\nShe is regarded as the Legendary Saiyan of her universe\n, a demon Saiyan who appears every thousand years to cause destruction at the cost of her own life, existing as Broly\u2019s Universe 6 female counterpart. She is a character who first appears in the Universal Survival Arc of the\nDragon Ball Super\nanime and manga.\nKale can transform into what appears to be\nBroly\u2019s Legendary Super Saiyan\n. In this form, her muscle mass increases even more, despite being slightly thinner than Broly (DBZ), her aura turns green, and her pupils disappear. His clothes and bracelets grow into this form and remain intact, much like the Saiyans\u2019 battle armor when they transform into Oozaru.\n1. Kefla\nKefla is the Saiyan fusion born from the union between Kale and Caulifla through the Pothala Earrings of the Kaio-shin Huwa. She first appears in the Universal Survival Arc of the\nDragon Ball Super\nanime and manga, where she is a representative of Team Universe 6 in the Tournament of Power. Vados explains that by fusing with the Pothala, she increases the power of the user tens of times, and as Kefla charges up energy, Goku can\u2019t feel a limit to her power.\nHer power is immense, and her speed is enough to surprise a\nSuper Saiyan God Goku\nquickly and, in turn, attack him and send him to the ground, only using her base state. When transforming into Super Saiyan, her power is able to maintain a more or less even fight with a Super Saiyan Blue Goku, forcing him to use the Kaio-ken x20 along with the transformation.\nReviews\nInterviews\nWrite for Us\nEditorial Policy\nDMCA & Removal Policy\nAffiliate Disclosure\nPress Kit\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms\nOwnership\nSitemap\nDepositphotos", "ped_digest": "P:Saiyans are a strong fictional race of warriors|They inhabited Planet Vegeta until its destruction|Saiyans exist in Universe 6 and Universe 7|Most Saiyans were prepared for battles|Saiyans have resistance;E:Toriyama introduced various Saiyans|Article ranks female Saiyans by strength|Honey and Onio traveled to Earth|Thunderbolt and Honey made out|Mizore assumes Fasha's identity|Akina is a gimmick character|Queen of the Saiyans was King Vegeta\u2019s consort|Note challenged Beat to a fight|Forte invaded the Dragon Ball Heroes universe|Bulma Leigh is Vegeta Jr.\u2019s mother|Bulla is Vegeta and Bulma\u2019s daughter|Nion researched infant development|Gine was Bardock\u2019s wife and Goku\u2019s mother|Pan is the daughter of Gohan and Videl|Caulifla defeated Frieza|Kale transformed into a Legendary Super Saiyan|Kefla fused with Kale and Caulifla;D:Saiyans inhabited Planet Vegeta|Planet Vegeta was destroyed by Frieza|Saiyans live on Planet Sadala|Honey and Onio wanted to establish a summer residence|Onio estimated a month to eliminate humans|Akina modeled after Akina Minami|Queen of the Saiyans was 731 years old|Note ranked 3rd in the tournament|Forte wears purple attire|Bulma Leigh appeared a century after Yi Xing Long lost|Bulla was born before the 28th Tenkaichi Budokai|Nion has a thin frame|Gine worked at the Meat Distribution Center|Pan is 1/4 Saiyan|Caulifla defeated Son Goku|Kale is the Legendary Super Saiyan|Planet Sadala|Planet Kanassan|Earth|Universe 6|Universe 7|Frieza|Toriyama|Onio|Honey|Thunderbolt|Neko Majin|Vegeta|Broly|Akina Minami|King Vegeta|Note|Beat|Forte|Bulma Leigh|Vegeta Jr.|Pan|Gohan|Videl|Caulifla|Kale|Kefla|Bardock|Goku|Raditz;", "er_digest": "N:Kale|Frieza|Videl|Honey|Broly|Bardock|Goku|Caulifla|King Vegeta|Gohan|Vegeta|Raditz|Onio|Toriyama|Kefla|Dragon Ball;", "gist": "P:Saiyans are a strong fictional race of warriors|They inhabited Planet Vegeta until its destruction|Saiyans exist in Universe 6 and Universe 7|Most Saiyans were prepared for battles|Saiyans have resistance;E:Toriyama introduced various Saiyans|Article ranks female Saiyans by strength|Honey and Onio traveled to Earth|Thunderbolt and Honey made out|Mizore assumes Fasha's identity|Akina is a gimmick character|Queen of the Saiyans was King Vegeta\u2019s consort|Note challenged Beat to a fight|Forte invaded the Dragon Ball Heroes universe|Bulma Leigh is Vegeta Jr.\u2019s mother|Bulla is Vegeta and Bulma\u2019s daughter|Nion researched infant development|Gine was Bardock\u2019s wife and Goku\u2019s mother|Pan is the daughter of Gohan and Videl|Caulifla defeated Frieza|Kale transformed into a Legendary Super Saiyan|Kefla fused with Kale and Caulifla;D:Saiyans inhabited Planet Vegeta|Planet Vegeta was destroyed by Frieza|Saiyans live on Planet Sadala|Honey and Onio wanted to establish a summer residence|Onio estimated a month to eliminate humans|Akina modeled after Akina Minami|Queen of the Saiyans was 731 years old|Note ranked 3rd in the tournament|Forte wears purple attire|Bulma Leigh appeared a century after Yi Xing Long lost|Bulla was born before the 28th Tenkaichi Budokai|Nion has a thin frame|Gine worked at the Meat Distribution Center|Pan is 1/4 Saiyan|Caulifla defeated Son Goku|Kale is the Legendary Super Saiyan|Planet Sadala|Planet Kanassan|Earth|Universe 6|Universe 7|Frieza|Toriyama|Onio|Honey|Thunderbolt|Neko Majin|Vegeta|Broly|Akina Minami|King Vegeta|Note|Beat|Forte|Bulma Leigh|Vegeta Jr.|Pan|Gohan|Videl|Caulifla|Kale|Kefla|Bardock|Goku|Raditz;N:Kale|Frieza|Videl|Honey|Broly|Bardock|Goku|Caulifla|King Vegeta|Gohan|Vegeta|Raditz|Onio|Toriyama|Kefla|Dragon Ball;", "entities": ["Kale", "Frieza", "Videl", "Honey", "Broly", "Bardock", "Goku", "Caulifla", "King Vegeta", "Gohan", "Vegeta", "Raditz", "Onio", "Toriyama", "Kefla", "Dragon Ball"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/one-piece-game-new-teaser/", "content": "The\nofficial\nOne Piece\nwebsite\nannounced that a new game is being developed for the IP. No other information was shared about what type of game it could be, leaving fans uncertain of what to expect from Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates. The news is a surprise considering\nBandai Namco was rumored to have ceased or slowed production\non its upcoming\nOne Piece\ngame. That said, the developer was not revealed with the announcement, so this could be a completely different game.\nWith the\nreveal of a new\nOne Piece\ngame coming soon\n, fans immediately began speculating what it could be. Many predicted a new entry in the Pirate Warriors series, while others jokingly suggested\nJump Force 2\n. A fighting game is not out of the question, but it may feature only\nOne Piece\ncharacters. A\nOne Piece\nRPG game, similar to\nOne Piece Odyssey\n, was another suggestion.\nOne Piece Odyssey by Bandai Namco and ILCA.\nRELATED:\n7 One Piece Characters Stronger Than Admiral Kizaru\nStill, others shared doubts about a\nOne Piece\ngame and whether it would be good or not. While there have been multiple games set in popular anime, many have not had a good reception. The license has been used to create multiple mobile games, which have been considered nothing but cash grabs, capitalizing on\nOne Piece\u2019s\nname.\nSome fans vocalized their wish for a true open-world RPG set in the world of\nOne Piece\n. A dream game in the anime would allow players to create their own characters, sail across the world, and recruit crew members. Players would be free to become a pirate or join the Marines and work their way up in either organization.\nIt remains to be seen what this\nOne Piece\ngame will be. It may be some time before anything comes out of this announcement, as it shared next to no details. The most recent\nOne Piece\ngame,\nOne Piece Odyssey\n, was released in 2023, meaning it has been a few years since fans received a game.\nThe post\nNew One Piece Game Teaser Has Fans Excited\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:New One Piece game is in development|Fans are speculating about the game's genre|Concerns exist regarding the quality of past One Piece games|Fans desire an open-world RPG|Last One Piece game was released in 2023;E:Official announcement of a new One Piece game|Rumors of Bandai Namco slowing down development on a previous game|Fans speculating on potential game types (Pirate Warriors, Jump Force 2, Fighting Game, RPG)|Release of One Piece Odyssey in 2023;D:One Piece Odyssey released in 2023|Multiple mobile games have been released|Several past games have received poor reception;", "er_digest": "N:Jump Force 2|Luffy|Admiral Kizaru|ComicBook.com|One Piece|Straw Hat Pirates|ILCA;", "gist": "P:New One Piece game is in development|Fans are speculating about the game's genre|Concerns exist regarding the quality of past One Piece games|Fans desire an open-world RPG|Last One Piece game was released in 2023;E:Official announcement of a new One Piece game|Rumors of Bandai Namco slowing down development on a previous game|Fans speculating on potential game types (Pirate Warriors, Jump Force 2, Fighting Game, RPG)|Release of One Piece Odyssey in 2023;D:One Piece Odyssey released in 2023|Multiple mobile games have been released|Several past games have received poor reception;N:Jump Force 2|Luffy|Admiral Kizaru|ComicBook.com|One Piece|Straw Hat Pirates|ILCA;", "entities": ["Jump Force 2", "Luffy", "Admiral Kizaru", "ComicBook.com", "One Piece", "Straw Hat Pirates", "ILCA"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/anime/news/one-piece-killingham-human-design-reveal/", "content": "As part of trying to raise the bar after the momentous Egghead Arc,\nOne Piece\n\u2018s\nElbaf Arc has introduced all-new exciting antagonists into the limelight in the form of the Holy Knights, the World Nobles\u2019 own elite guard. The Holy Knights have brought in not only new, wackier-than-ever devil fruit powers but also fresh new mysteries attached to each character.\nGunko, who appears to have a past with Brook\nand Shamrock, who was revealed to be Shanks\u2019 twin brother, might just be the two most interesting Holy Knights in that regard. However,\nOne Piece\u2019s\nlatest chapter just revealed its coolest-looking Holy Knight, and it\u2019s the member you\u2019d least expect.\nChapter 1151 of\nOne Piece\njust revealed St. Killingham\u2019s hybrid form, which consists of a centaur-like form much like St. Nusjuro. Unexpectedly, St. Killingham\u2019s human appearance is quite a sharp contrast to the fully transformed look that fans have seen so far. Killingham sports spiky dark hair, spiked, Fishman-like teeth, and even long, spiky eyelashes, giving the otherwise benevolent-looking Holy Knight quite an edgy, handsome look. Interestingly enough, St. Killingham\u2019s man-beast form also comes with quite a shift in his personality, altogether making his character far more interesting than fans initially assumed.\n[RELATED:\nOne Piece\nJust Gave Luffy His Best Alliance Since Wano\n]\nOne Piece\nReveals St. Killingham\u2019s Hybrid Form and Stunning Design\nAs far as good looks among the Holy Knights go, until now, it seemed like Shamrock had won the genetic lottery. However, Eiichiro Oda has proven otherwise with Killingham, who is not only deceptively good-looking but also boasts a very distinct design. Killingham\u2019s spiked teeth make him look like he could be a Fishman, though, considering the prejudice and racism the Fishmen have faced for centuries, and the fact that even attending the Reverie was only a recent feat, it seems unlikely that the Holy Knights would grant such a high-ranking position to a Fishman.\nThat said, it is possible that St. Killingham belongs to the unnamed race that Charlotte Galette and Poire belong to, seeing as they possess similar eyelashes and spiked teeth, respectively. It is also quite interesting that Killingham takes on a much more maniacal and somewhat violent personality when in his man-beast form, as until now his personality has been quite subdued and pacifistic. It may be that the inherent benevolent nature of the kirin influences Killingham\u2019s personality when he is completely transformed, as mythical zoans do tend to have a will of their own.

(KMIZ)\nThe Columbia City Council spent more than $42,000 on a two-day retreat in May with city staff in Camdenton.\nRecords obtained by ABC 17 News show the final bill is nearly 2.5 times\nhigher than the 2023 retreat to Independence\n, Missouri, which cost $17,153.94.\nThe total cost of the trip to Camdenton was $42,606.85, with the bill including:\n$25,000.00 for training costs\n$9,839.57 meals\n$5,955.64 for lodging\n$1,811.64 mileage\nThese totals included $15,597.88 for two days at The Club at Old Kinderwood, which mainly covered the cost of banquet food and drinks.\nCity spokesperson Sydney Olsen said 37 people attended the retreat, which included all current council members, Mayor Barbara Buffaloe, Police Chief Jill Schlude, Fire Chief Brian Schafer, and City Manager De\u2019Carlon Seewood.\nRetreat\nDownload\n\u201cThis is something that we started in 2022, and it was an opportunity for City Council members and city leadership to get together,\u00a0get out of town and talk about both what's going well, what's happening in the community and then also the organization, as well as what's on the horizon,\u201d Buffaloe told ABC 17 News.\nSeewood said that he has seen progress with how staff works together since starting these retreats.\n\u201cWhen I first became city manager, sometimes it felt like there was a lot of division between the council and you're starting to see people really work more collaboratively together and there's more relationship between staff and council to actually work on things as a team as opposed to this adversarial approach,\u201d Seewood said.\nAccording to Buffaloe, topics discussed at the retreat included preferred methods of communication between staff and constituents, as well as key challenges departments are facing ahead of the fiscal 2026 budget.\n\u201cI've seen a tremendous change since 2022 with the relationships built between staff and the councilmembers,\u201d Buffaloe said when asked if the retreat was effective. \u201cWe need the professionals on staff to do the day-to-day work to help meet the goals of our community members.\u201d\nThe biggest change in the retreat budget was a $25,000 fee to\nRaftelis\nfor \u201ctraining cost.\u201d Records show the city paid Raftelis -- which provides management consulting to help local governments -- $15,000 for its May retreat. The city spent just $5,000 on Raftelis during its 2023 retreat.\n\u201cJust like any corporation, doing leadership retreats are important and you see that happening across the nation,\u201d Buffaloe said. \u201cI view that local government needs to also follow those same practices.\u201d\nDespite the hefty price tag, Seewood believes these types of retreats have contributed to the progress the city has made over the last two years.\n\u201cOne of the things you want to do is you want to make sure that your executive team, your board members, all are working for the best interest of the community,\u201d Seewood said.\u00a0 \u201cHaving those times away where you can actually sit down,\u00a0 have a consultant kind of help, you kind of talk about goals, talk about objectives, talk about priorities to make sure that you can move in the right direction.\u201d\nThe post\nColumbia City Council retreat in May cost more than double the cost of 2023\u2019s retreat\nappeared first on\nABC17NEWS\n.", "ped_digest": "P:City Council retreats are important for leadership development and collaboration|Retreats have contributed to improved staff-council relationships|Topics discussed included communication methods and fiscal 2026 budget challenges;E:City Council held a two-day retreat in Camdenton in May|The retreat cost $42,606.85, significantly higher than the 2023 retreat|Raftelis provided training for $15,000;D:The 2023 retreat cost $17,153.94|The Camdenton retreat cost $42,606.85|Training costs were $25,000.00|Meals cost $9,839.57|Lodging cost $5,955.64|Mileage cost $1,811.64|Banquet food and drinks at The Club at Old Kinderwood cost $15,597.88|37 people attended the retreat|Raftelis was paid $15,000 for the May retreat, compared to $5,000 in 2023;", "er_digest": "N:Sydney Olsen|Brian Schafer|Jill Schlude|De\u2019Carlon Seewood|Barbara Buffaloe|ABC 17 News;R:Missouri|Columbia;", "gist": "P:City Council retreats are important for leadership development and collaboration|Retreats have contributed to improved staff-council relationships|Topics discussed included communication methods and fiscal 2026 budget challenges;E:City Council held a two-day retreat in Camdenton in May|The retreat cost $42,606.85, significantly higher than the 2023 retreat|Raftelis provided training for $15,000;D:The 2023 retreat cost $17,153.94|The Camdenton retreat cost $42,606.85|Training costs were $25,000.00|Meals cost $9,839.57|Lodging cost $5,955.64|Mileage cost $1,811.64|Banquet food and drinks at The Club at Old Kinderwood cost $15,597.88|37 people attended the retreat|Raftelis was paid $15,000 for the May retreat, compared to $5,000 in 2023;N:Sydney Olsen|Brian Schafer|Jill Schlude|De\u2019Carlon Seewood|Barbara Buffaloe|ABC 17 News;R:Missouri|Columbia;", "entities": ["Sydney Olsen", "Brian Schafer", "Jill Schlude", "De\u2019Carlon Seewood", "Barbara Buffaloe", "ABC 17 News"], "regions": ["Missouri", "Columbia"]}, {"_id": "https://essential-japan.com/news/ranma-1-2-pop-up-shop-to-open-in-bookstores-across-japan-this-month/", "content": "Last Updated on June 9, 2025\nEvent Overview\nA new pop up shop for Ranma 1/2 will open between June and July, with a range of exclusive merchandise available to purchase.\nMerchandise\nA wide variety of goods will be on sale, including acrylic stands, keychains, badges and more.\nTrading car badge \u2013 550 yen each\nAcrylic cards \u2013 660 yen each\nAcrylic stands \u2013 1,650 yen each\nAcrylic keychains \u2013 990 yen each\nClear file \u2013 495 yen each\nMini character stand \u2013 660 yen\nFlat pouch \u2013 1,100 yen\nStickers \u2013 330 yen each\nPurchase Bonus\nFor every 2,200 yen spent at the pop up shop, customers will receive 1 exclusive\npostcard\n(selected at random from 6 types).\nEntry Cost\nFree.\nParticipating Stores\nTohoku\nMiyagi Prefecture\nTSUTAYA Sendai Station Store\nFukushima Prefecture\nTSUTAYA Shirakawa store\nKanto\nGunma Prefecture\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE AQUAL Maebashi\nChiba Prefecture\nTSUTAYA Kashiwa Station Store\nTsutaya Bookstore Mobara Branch\nTokyo\nBOOK COMPASS Ecute Ueno store\nSHIBUYA TSUTAYA\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE Shibuya Sakura Stage\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE EQUiA Narimasu store\nAsahi Bookstore Ikebukuro store\nTSUTAYA Machida Kiso store\nKanagawa Prefecture\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE Kawasaki Station\nChubu\nAichi Prefecture\nKusazo BOOKS Shinmoriyama store\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE Noritake Shinmachi\nTSUTAYA Imajin Shiraage Wing Town Okazaki\nKinki\nKyoto Prefecture\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE APIT Kyoto Shijo\nOsaka Prefecture\nTSUTAYA EBISUBASHI\nTSUTAYA Abenobashi store\nTSUTAYA Sakai Platt Platt store\nTSUTAYA BOOKSTORE Viva Mall Neyagawa\nShikoku\nTokushima Prefecture\nTSUTAYA Tamiya store\nKyushu\nFukuoka Prefecture\nFukuoka Tenjin Tsutaya Bookstore\nTSUTAYA Costa Yukuhashi store\nTSUTAYA Sunlive Munakata store\nTSUTAYA BOOK GARAGE Fukuoka Shime\nEvent Details\ncalendar_month\nDATE\nJun 13 2025 -

Nawrocki insists that Ukraine should recognise it. The two countries are now cooperating on exhumations to locate victims in Ukraine, but tensions remain high.\nEconomic tensions are also rising fast. Nawrocki says Ukrainian grain and transport companies pose \u201cunfair competition\u201d to Polish sectors already under pressure. He wants a new deal between Warsaw and Kyiv, one that protects Polish farmers and hauliers.\nNawrocki\u2019s stance is also political. Just before the election, he struck a deal with the conservative Confederation Party, accepting their demand to block Ukraine\u2019s path to NATO in exchange for their support.\nRead\nhere\nmore news from Poland.\nTags:\nKarol Nawrocki\n,\nukraine\n,\nUkraine EU\nShare this story\nshare on WhatsApp\nshare on Flipboard\nshare on Email\nSign up for personalised news\nSubscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nBy signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

As the flagship character of Marvel Comics, Spider-Man has all the iconography he needs to stand on his own and carry his own comic book title. Throughout the decades, the Web-Head has done just that, often being the subject of multiple individual titles simultaneously, but that, of course, doesn\u2019t preclude him from working with other Marvel heroes either. Spider-Man\u2019s membership with the Avengers and his general standing in Marvel\u2019s superhero community frequently sees him joining forces with other heroes, either on a larger team or as a pair with either Spider-Man or his partner guest-starring in the other\u2019s solo comic book.\nThere\u2019s virtually no other Marvel superhero whom Spider-Man has not fought alongside at least once in his extended Web-Slinging career. What that said, some of Spidey\u2019s team-ups have a particularly engaging energy to them, with Spidey\u2019s ally bringing a unique quality to the story all their own. Here are the 5 Marvel superheroes who are the most fun to see Spider-Man team-up with.\n1) Daredevil\nWhen it comes to allies of the Web-Slinger, one of his best also happens to be a really good lawyer names Matt Murdock a.k.a. Daredevil.\nSpidey and Daredevil\n\u2018s street-level crime fighting frequently leads to the two partnering up, and the with pair\u2019s particular power sets, it often leads to some flashy action scenes and two-page spreads of Spidey and Daredevil taking down gangs of bad guys in tandem. Additionally, Spidey and Daredevil have a shared nemesis in\nWilson Fisk a.k.a. the Kingpin\n, which often forms the basis for their team-ups and pits them against a villain who is formidable even with their combined might. Whenever Spider-Man and Daredevil unite on a mission, it\u2019s bound to be a fun one for readers.\n2) Black Cat\nSpider-Man\u2019s romantic life tends to have Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy at its center, but it is often overlooked how great of a couple and team Spider-Man and\nFelicia Hardy a.k.a. Black Cat\nmake. Black Cat is by far the most free-spirited and fun-loving of Peter Parker\u2019s significant others, which makes their banter on team-ups often flirtatiously geared on Felicia\u2019s part, and with a quippy quality in Felicia\u2019s shorthand reference to the Web-Head as simply \u201cSpider\u201d. Additionally, Felicia\u2019s bad luck powers and fighting skills make her a great ally for Spidey to call upon the assistance for. Though they\u2019ve technically moved on from each other as a romantic couple, the love between Spidey and Black Cat always simmers just below the surface, and adds a Valentine\u2019s Day-quality of fun whenever they join forces.\nRELATED:\nAmazing Spider-Man\n\u2019s Final Issue Cracks\nSpider-Man 3\nJoke\n3) The Human Torch\nEarly on his superheroic career, Peter Parker made an effort to join the Fantastic Four, and while the still youthful Web-Slinger left the Baxter Building aghast that Marvel\u2019s First Family is a strictly pro-bono operation, he found a life-long friend in Johnny Storm a.k.a. the Human Torch. Spider-Man and the Human Torch are cut from the same cloth as light-hearted heroes who relish their shared talent for one-liners, and the fact that Peter and Johnny are in a similar age bracket made it easy for the two to hit it off right away as superheroes who relate to one another. Whenever Spider-Man and the Human Torch team-up, it goes without saying there will be plenty of fireworks on their mission.\n4) Deadpool\nOnly one Marvel Comics character has as much of a reputation for comedic banter and one-liners as Spider-Man, and that is Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool. Given Deadpool\u2019s anti-heroic nature, any team-up between the Wall-Crawler and the Merc with a Mouth has its share of tension, with Wade\u2019s predilection for using bullets, blades, and cartoonishly lethal force running up against Spider-Man\u2019s aversion to killing. Nonetheless,\nSpider-Man and Deadpool team-ups\nnever fail to be anything but a lot of fun with their buddy comedy banter and Wade\u2019s fourth-wall breaking sprinkled in.\n5) Captain America\nEven with his level of experience and reputation within the Marvel superhero community, Spider-Man still has plenty of fellow heroes whom he looks up with genuine hero worship of his own. Case in point \u2013 Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America. Compared to Spider-Man\u2019s light-hearted team-ups with Black Cat, the Human Torch, and Deadpool, and his more focused partnerships with Daredevil, Spider-Man willingly accepts becoming a borderline sidekick whenever he teams up with Captain America. Even in Spidey-led ensemble stories like\nMaximum Carnage\n, Spider-Man looks to Captain America as a true leader. Moreover, during their brief falling out during the\nCivil War\nstory arc, Spidey still approached his conflict with Cap with great reverence, and did the same when the two finally joined forces by the end. Even Spider-Man needs a hero to aspire to be like, and his team-ups with Captain America always exemplify how much respect Peter Parker has for the world\u2019s original super-soldier.\nThe post\nSpider-Man\u2019s 5 Most Fun Team-Up Partners\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Spider-Man frequently teams up with other superheroes|Spider-Man is the flagship character of Marvel Comics|Spider-Man often works with other Marvel heroes|Spider-Man has fought alongside many superheroes|Spider-Man and Daredevil frequently partner up|Spider-Man and Black Cat make a great couple and team|Spider-Man and the Human Torch are light-hearted heroes|Spider-Man and Deadpool have comedic banter|Spider-Man looks up to Captain America|Spider-Man willingly accepts becoming a sidekick with Captain AmericaE:Spider-Man teams up with Daredevil to fight crime|Spider-Man and Daredevil face Wilson Fisk|Spider-Man and Black Cat banter flirtatiously|Spider-Man and Human Torch join forces|Spider-Man and Deadpool team up|Spider-Man teams up with Captain America|Spider-Man and Captain America had a falling out during Civil War|Spider-Man and Human Torch relish their shared talent for one-linersD:Spider-Man is a.k.a.

In this genre, it\u2019s not just what happens that scares you, but what you believe could.\nMovies that say they\u2019re based on real events make everything feel more intense \u2013 even when that \u201creal\u201d part is hanging by a thread or totally made up. Here are 10 horror movies that knew exactly how to use the \u201cbased on real events\u201d label as a clever hook.\n1)\nAnnabelle\nEven people who don\u2019t care for horror movies have heard of\nAnnabelle\n\u2013 one of the movies\nfrom the famous\nThe Conjuring\nfranchise\n. The film centers on John (Ward Horton) and Mia (Annabelle Wallis), a young couple expecting their first child whose quiet life is shattered after they\u2019re attacked by members of a satanic cult. During the violent encounter, blood is spilled on a rare doll, setting off a chain of supernatural events that invites a demonic presence into their home.\nThe movie claims inspiration from a real-life case investigated by famed paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren, who said a Raggedy Ann doll was possessed by an evil spirit. The doll was handed over by two nursing students in the \u201970s and now resides in the Warren Occult Museum. But beyond the eerie backstory, there\u2019s no evidence of satanic cults, violence, or anything resembling the events in the movie. In fact, the only true connection is\nthe idea of a haunted doll\n.\nAnnabelle\nis a chilling story, but it\u2019s one stitched together with fiction rather than facts.\n2)\nThe Blair Witch Project\n[RELATED \u2013\n5 Horror Movies Based on Urban Legends\n]\nA landmark in horror cinema,\nThe Blair Witch Project\nshook things up\nwith its found footage style\n\u2013 and maybe that\u2019s exactly why so many people believed it was real. The movie follows three film students who vanish in the woods of Maryland while filming a documentary on the Blair Witch legend. What happens next is all psychological terror, and the raw, handheld footage only made it feel more authentic,\nespecially for audiences in the late \u201990s who had never seen anything quite like it\n.\nBut beyond the film itself, this was one of horror\u2019s most brilliant marketing stunts. The creators built an entire fake world around the Blair Witch myth \u2013 fake websites, phony interviews, and even made-up police reports. The actors vanished from the media on purpose to sell the story even harder. The reality? There was no witch, no Blair, and nothing spontaneous about the footage. Everything was meticulously planned.\nThe Blair Witch Project\nwasn\u2019t just a movie \u2013 it was one of the most successful hoaxes ever dressed up as a true story. And it totally worked.\n3)\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre\nWhen a horror movie links its story to a real serial killer,\nthe fear instantly hits different\n. That\u2019s exactly what happened with the iconic\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre\n, still remembered as one of the most unsettling horror films ever made. The movie follows a group of young friends who, while passing through rural Texas, stumble upon a terrifying family of cannibals \u2013\nincluding the unforgettable Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen)\n, known for his skin mask and roaring chainsaw.\nThe character was loosely inspired by Ed Gein, a notorious murderer from Wisconsin. But here\u2019s the thing: Gein never used a chainsaw, never lived in Texas, and didn\u2019t come from a family of killers. What he did do was collect body parts, which influenced the disturbing aesthetics of Leatherface. The whole \u201cbased on a true story\u201d claim? It was just a bold and very effective marketing move meant to leave people squirming in their seats. The actual events might\u2019ve been twisted and exaggerated beyond recognition, but that\u2019s what made the horror hit so hard.\n4)\nThe Conjuring\nJames Wan is one of the biggest names in horror, and with\nThe Conjuring\n(\nwhich quickly turned into a full-blown franchise\n), he delivered what seemed like a faithful dramatization of the real-life cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren. The film centers on the Perron family, who are\ntormented by supernatural events\nafter moving into a secluded farmhouse in Rhode Island.\nWith its eerie vibe\n, well-timed scares, and emotional weight, the movie became a box office hit \u2013 helped, of course, by the whole \u201cbased on a true story\u201d angle.\nBut when it comes to facts, things get a little fuzzy. The demon Bathsheba Sherman (Joseph Bishara), portrayed as a witch who cursed the land and died by suicide, was a real person \u2013 but there\u2019s no real evidence linking her to any murders or dark rituals. In fact, a lot of the events have been questioned by historians and even members of the Perron family, whose versions of the story don\u2019t always line up. So, while\nThe Conjuring\nclaims to stick close to reality, it\u2019s really more of a polished ghost story with a few real names thrown in.\n5)\nParanormal Activity\nParanormal Activity\nmight not top the list of horror favorites these days (especially with many now labeling it as \u201cfake\u201d), but back when it debuted,\nit was a cultural phenomenon\n. Shot in the found footage style, the film follows a couple dealing with strange, escalating supernatural events in their home. Made on a shoestring budget and filmed in the director\u2019s own house, it stood out for its stripped-down realism, with the actors even using their real names, which added an unsettling layer of authenticity.\nThat raw, mundane atmosphere was so convincing that\na lot of people genuinely thought they were watching a real story\n. Riding on the wave of\nThe Blair Witch Project\n, the film\u2019s marketing was laser-focused on audience reactions, making it seem like a true account caught on camera. But despite the internet myths and late-night debates,\nParanormal Activity\nis pure fiction \u2013 there\u2019s no real case or documented haunting behind it. Still, the illusion worked.\n6)\nCannibal Holocaust\nCannibal Holocaust\nremains one of the most notorious horror films ever made, though not everyone is familiar with\nits dark legacy\n. The movie is framed as a found documentary, following a group of filmmakers who vanish in the Amazon rainforest while filming indigenous cannibal tribes. The story unfolds through recovered footage interspersed with rescue scenes, showing graphic violence, abuse, and cannibalism in such raw detail that many viewers believed it was a real snuff film (a type of movie that shows actual murder).\nThe backlash was immediate and severe:\ndirector Ruggero Deodato was even arrested on murder charges\nand had to bring the actors to court alive to prove the film was staged. However, despite its shocking realism,\nCannibal Holocaust\nis entirely fictional. Its infamy grew from a mix of extreme violence and clever behind-the-scenes tactics \u2013 including contracts that kept actors out of the public eye temporarily. Banned in over 50 countries, mainly due to actual animal cruelty shown on screen, the film has since become a cult classic, heavily influencing later horror hits like\nThe Blair Witch Project\nand\nParanormal Activity\n.\n7)\nThe Possession\nThe Possession\nis one of those movies that immediately sets the nerves on edge by claiming to be based on true events. However, in reality, its connection to fact is almost entirely made up. The film tells the story of Em (Natasha Calis), a young girl who begins acting strangely after buying an old wooden box at a garage sale. The box supposedly contains a dybbuk \u2013 an evil spirit from Jewish folklore that attaches itself to people and possesses them. As Em\u2019s behavior grows more disturbing, her desperate parents seek the help of a rabbi to free her from the malevolent force.\nThe movie was inspired by the story of the so-called \u201cdybbuk box,\u201d an item that gained notoriety on eBay\nin the early 2000s\n. The original seller, Kevin Mannis, claimed he bought the box from a Holocaust survivor and that it brought paranormal disturbances and bad luck to those who owned it. But it wasn\u2019t until 2021 that he admitted the whole thing was made up \u2013 just a story to entertain people and take advantage of how quickly things go viral online. Basically, it was a deliberate hoax that scared a lot of people at a time when the internet was really becoming part of everyday life. The story quickly caught the attention of paranormal fans everywhere.\n8)\nThe Strangers\nAlthough the supernatural is something that frightens us, perhaps what terrifies the public most is when it involves only human beings.\nThe Strangers\nis a psychological thriller centered on a couple whose home is invaded by three masked figures during a seemingly ordinary night. The horror of the film comes simply from the calculated and random coldness of the intruders, who claim to be there simply because the couple was home. There is tension throughout and a sense of restrained violence, and when it is revealed that the entire story was based on real events, it is basically a signal for everyone to be on alert even when they are at their own houses.\nHowever, despite this claim,\nThe Strangers\nis pure fiction. Director Bryan Bertino said he was inspired by a childhood experience when strangers knocked on his door while he and his sister were home alone \u2013 only to discover later that the visitors were connected to a string of robberies in the neighborhood. Other than that, there was also inspiration from the Manson Family murders. But the entire story of the film has no documentary basis, only reflections of real situations transformed into cinematic horror. It was a case of superior marketing, that\u2019s for sure.\n9)\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\nThe theme of exorcism in horror is widely debated, and in fact, it\u2019s something we hear about in many real-life cases.\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\nis a significant movie that tackles this subject, but it clearly exaggerates for dramatic and frightening effect. The story follows a young woman who experiences paranormal phenomena and ultimately dies during an exorcism. It draws inspiration from the real-life case of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who underwent numerous exorcism rituals in the \u201970s before dying from malnutrition and related health complications.\nUsing this case as a foundation, the film explores the tension between faith and science through a story where the priest who performed the exorcism is charged with negligent homicide. However,\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\nchanges many details \u2013 including names, locations, and events \u2013 to heighten the drama. While it presents the debate between psychiatric illness and demonic possession with intensity, the real-life case is far more complex and far less supernatural than the movie portrays.\n10)\nWolf Creek\nWolf Creek\nwas promoted as a film based on actual events, largely because it effectively portrays the terrifying unpredictability of a group trip gone wrong. The story follows three backpackers who, while traveling through the Australian outback, are captured by Mick Taylor (John Jarratt), a psychopathic hunter who subjects them to a nightmare of torture and violence. The real fear comes from the exploration of vulnerability in isolated places and the looming threat of random, senseless violence. While this may feel like a familiar trope in fiction, it resonates deeply because many have experienced that primal fear in real life.\nHowever, the movie does not depict a specific true crime nor does it claim to be a direct recounting of actual events. Instead,\nWolf Creek\ndraws inspiration from real cases of backpacker murders in Australia, particularly those committed by Ivan Milat and Bradley Murdoch. The character of Mick Taylor is basically a mix of those killers rolled into one, and the plot is dramatized to maximize tension and horror. Despite this, the film achieved notable success and\nled to sequels\nand a TV series,\ncementing its place in the horror genre\n.\nThe post\n10 Great Horror Movies Based on True Stories (That Are

him anywhere following\nDaredevil: Born Again\nSeason 1, but the character would benefit most from remaining a street-level superhero. The masked vigilante (known as Matt Murdock during his days as a lawyer) made his live-action debut in Netflix\u2019s\nDaredevil\nseries, which aired three seasons from 2015 to 2018.\nDaredevil\nwas retroactively canonized into the MCU when\nCox briefly appeared as Murdock in 2021\u2019s\nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n, paving the way for his solo series revival in\nBorn Again\non Disney+ four years later. Daredevil also held small roles in the Disney+ series\nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law\nand\nEcho\n\u2013 but as of now, Daredevil\u2019s only confirmed future MCU appearance is in\nBorn Again\nSeason 2, set to premiere in 2026.\nAs the MCU nears its next major two-part event with 2026\u2019s\nAvengers: Doomsday\nand 2027\u2019s\nAvengers: Secret Wars\n, fans are endlessly speculating about who will take part in the upcoming films. But Daredevil, like the other Defenders members Frank Castle/Punisher (Jon Bernthal),\nJessica Jones (Krysten Ritter)\n, Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones), is and always has been a street-level hero in his own corner of the Marvel universe. Just because the gigantic scope of the Multiverse Saga\u2019s biggest films can incorporate any and every hero, villain, or multiversal variant doesn\u2019t mean that they need to bring in Daredevil.\nDaredevil\u2019s Greatest Strength Is His Work in Hell\u2019s Kitchen\nDaredevil: Born Again\nfurther cements the truth that Matt\u2019s most compelling involvement in the franchise remains his work as a lawyer and as a vigilante in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, New York City. In Season 1, Matt mourns his best friend Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), defends accused cop killer\nHector Ayala/White Tiger (Kamar de los Reyes)\nin court, and meets a new love interest all against the backdrop of his nemesis Wilson Fisk/Kingpin (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio) taking office as the mayor of New York.\nBorn Again\n\u2018s strong focus on Matt\u2019s navigation of his different lives while danger takes over on the streets of the city and in the mayor\u2019s office keeps the story grounded amid the action. Viewers get a thorough sense of Matt\u2019s struggle to reclaim his identity as Daredevil, his determination to achieve justice for his client, and his desire to keep those he loves safe because the show affords him the space for such intricate characterization and engrossing plot threads.\nRELATED:\n5 Biggest Questions We Have for Daredevil: Born Again Season 2\nIt\u2019s clear now that Daredevil has his role in the MCU and that he should keep it. Daredevil doesn\u2019t need to venture beyond New York because that could obscure his identity as a small-scale hero who operates in his community. Fighting for justice for the people of Hell\u2019s Kitchen in the courtroom and on the streets defines Matt and Daredevil\u2019s mission, and universe-altering threats are not his job. Thus, Daredevil\u2019s future MCU outings should only come in street-level projects such as\nBorn Again\n. Right now, the\nPunisher\nspecial and\nSpider-Man: Brand New Day\nlook like the most optimal installments for a Daredevil supporting role.\nThe MCU\u2019s Upcoming\nAvengers\nMovies Have No Need for Daredevil\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Daredevil has what it takes to join the ranks of the MCU\u2019s Avengers, but there\u2019s no reason to force him into\nDoomsday\nor\nSecret Wars\nsimply because fans love him. Daredevil isn\u2019t a great character because of his skill in combat, rather, it\u2019s his detailed arc and relationships with the people around him that make the hero a fascinating individual. Placing Daredevil into bigger stories, such as Doomsday and Secret Wars, would likely undersell these essential aspects of Daredevil\u2019s identity as a lawyer and vigilante unknown to the world at large. Perhaps Daredevil could step in if it really makes sense, but the MCU should not force him into these already crowded movies just for the sake of it.\nWith\nDaredevil: Born Again\nSeason 2 a year away and a third season potentially in the works afterward, there\u2019s no need to shove Daredevil into other projects where he doesn\u2019t belong, narrative-wise. Matt\u2019s story in the MCU has only just begun, though the MCU needs to make sure that it doesn\u2019t stray from what makes him an excellent hero. Keeping Daredevil confined to his justice-seeking activities in Hell\u2019s Kitchen will allow him to develop even better as a complex character, as including him in big events will never give him an adequate stage. Being a sidekick to the Avengers in the MCU\u2019s high-stakes multiverse battle doesn\u2019t fit Daredevil\u2019s style, so it would suit him better to continue his path as a street-level hero.\nAll episodes of\nDaredevil: Born Again\nSeason 1 and all seasons of Netflix\u2019s\nDaredevil\nshow are available to stream on Disney+.\nThe post\nDaredevil Should Be A Street-Level Hero in the MCU (Not An Avengers Movie Star)\nappeared first on\nComicBook.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Daredevil should remain a street-level hero|Daredevil's strength is his work in Hell's Kitchen|Daredevil doesn't need to venture beyond New York|Universe-altering threats are not Daredevil's job|Daredevil's future MCU outings should be street-level projects;E:Daredevil's live-action debut in Netflix's Daredevil series|Cox appeared as Murdock in Spider-Man: No Way Home|Born Again revival on Disney+|Daredevil appeared in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law and Echo|Born Again Season 2 set to premiere in 2026|Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars upcoming|Matt mourns Foggy Nelson|Hector Ayala/White Tiger defended in court|Wilson Fisk/Kingpin takes office as mayor of New York;D:Daredevil series aired from 2015 to 2018|Born Again on Disney+ four years later|Born Again Season 2 premieres in 2026|Multiverse Saga\u2019s biggest films|Matt's best friend Foggy Nelson;", "er_digest": "N:Charlie Cox|Matt Murdock;R:United States;", "gist": "P:Daredevil should remain a street-level hero|Daredevil's strength is his work in Hell's Kitchen|Daredevil doesn't need to venture beyond New York|Universe-altering threats are not Daredevil's job|Daredevil's future MCU outings should be street-level projects;E:Daredevil's live-action debut in Netflix's Daredevil series|Cox appeared as Murdock in Spider-Man: No Way Home|Born Again revival on Disney+|Daredevil appeared in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law and Echo|Born Again Season 2 set to premiere in 2026|Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars upcoming|Matt mourns Foggy Nelson|Hector Ayala/White Tiger defended in court|Wilson Fisk/Kingpin takes office as mayor of New York;D:Daredevil series aired from 2015 to 2018|Born Again on Disney+ four years later|Born Again Season 2 premieres in 2026|Multiverse Saga\u2019s biggest films|Matt's best friend Foggy Nelson;N:Charlie Cox|Matt Murdock;R:United States;", "entities": ["Charlie Cox", "Matt Murdock"], "regions": ["United States"]}, {"_id": "https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/gears-of-war-remaster-ps5-release-cancelled-japan/", "content": "Gears of War: Reloaded\nis canceling its PS5 version in a pretty major country. The Gears of War franchise is a staple for the Xbox brand and is one of the key pillars of the console next to Halo and Forza.\nGears of War\nwas one of the first defining titles for the Xbox 360 as there was no Halo game at launch and Xbox was looking to find another IP that could help highlight the brand. As a result, Halo and Gears of War more or less made Xbox the console for \u201cbro shooters\u201d in the late 2000s and early 2010s, eventually luring in the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield for timed exclusive content and marketing deals.\nWith that said, there have been rumblings of Gears of War coming to PlayStation at various points over the years. Epic Games developed a port of\nGears of War 3\non PlayStation 3, but it was never officially released. This was a result of Epic trying to work on Unreal Engine 3 for PS3 and it used\nGears of War 3\nas sort of a test. Ultimately,\nGears of War 3\nwas never officially intended to release on PS3, but it didn\u2019t stop speculation and rumors. Now,\nGears of War\nis\nactually coming to PlayStation\nvia a new remaster of the original game. However, one country won\u2019t get to enjoy it on PS5.\nGears of War: Reloaded\nWon\u2019t Release on PS5 in Japan\ngears of war: reloaded\nXbox has confirmed that\nGears of War: Reloaded\n\u2018s PS5 port will not release in Japan due to regional ratings and platform policies. However, the remaster will still be playable on Xbox and PC in Japan. It\u2019s unclear exactly what the issue is, but it\u2019s possible that PlayStation is a bit more restrictive with extreme violence and gore in Japan.\n\u201cDue to regional rating restrictions and platform policies, Gears of War: Reloaded will not be released for PlayStation 5 in Japan,\u201d reads a post from Xbox. \u201cDomestic players will still be able to play the game on launch day through Xbox Series X|S, Xbox PC, Game Pass, and Steam. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to players in Japan who have been waiting for the release of this game.\u201d\nThis comes ahead of\nGears of War: Reloaded\n\u2018s upcoming multiplayer beta\nthis weekend, which Japanese PS5 players won\u2019t be able to experience. The PlayStation 5 is significantly more popular than Xbox in Japan, simply because PlayStation has done a better job of catering to that audience over the years despite Xbox\u2019s efforts to improve the disparity. As a result, this may really hurt Gears of War\u2019s chances for growth in Japan now.

He covers business, economics, money and workplace issues for CBS MoneyWatch.\nRead Full Bio\nAlain Sherter\nUpdated on: June 9, 2025 / 5:20 PM EDT\n/ CBS News\nThe dream of homeownership is fading for millions of Americans.\nFigures from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 that's down from 50% in 2010. The typical purchaser is also older than in the past, with an average\nage of 38\n, or about 10 years above historical norms.\nSuch trends reflect the challenges of climbing on the property ladder as home prices hover near record highs, inventory remains low and with mortgage rates at their highest level in years.\n\"There are fewer first-time homebuyers and they are older than we've ever seen, both because of headwinds inside and outside of the housing market,\" NAR deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told CBS MoneyWatch.\nOpportunity missed\nAmericans who are shut out from buying their first homes miss out on an opportunity to build wealth through homeownership, Lautz said.\n\"It's their biggest asset, and with the delay into homeownership first-time homebuyers are losing about 10 years of housing wealth. And that's for those who can enter into the market,\" she said. \"For those who can't, they lose out on housing wealth by not having that as the biggest asset in their nest egg.\"\nOnly about 1 in 5 listed homes in March\nwere affordable\nfor households with $75,000 in annual income, according to a NAR\nanalysis\nof property listings. Today, a household with annual income of $50,000 can only afford 8.7% of listings, down from 9.4% a year ago, according to the data.\n\"The lack of homes, especially at affordable price points where they would be entering the market, has been plaguing first-time homebuyers for the last several years,\" Lautz said. \"It's been a continual issue, especially with interest rates. It makes the cost of homeownership quite high.\"\nAlong with inadequate construction of affordable housing, many existing homeowners are reluctant to sell their properties given their lower mortgage rates.\n\"People who are homeowners have no motivational factors to move, so that's not freeing up inventory,\" Lautz said. \"It's almost created a hoarding situation for those in low-interest rate mortgages who don't want to separate from them.\"\nFinancial squeeze\nOther factors are making it hard for people to buy a first home. The high cost of rent gets in the way of saving for a down payment, while credit card debt, car loans and child care costs also hold first-time homebuyers back. More recently, meanwhile, the resumption of\nstudent loan payments\nis putting many people under financial pressure.\nSome Americans are managing to save enough for a first home by temporarily moving in with family or friends to minimize the cost of rent, Lautz said. But that approach isn't viable for everyone.\n\"It has been a pathway to ownership for some. But for someone who is 38-years-old, moving in with mom and dad can get uncomfortable,\" she said. \"For an older homebuyer, that might be less attractive for everyone involved.\"\nAffordable Housing\nHousing Crisis\nMegan Cerullo\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

New research out today shows that people\u2019s odds of being diagnosed with dementia differ significantly across different parts of the U.S.\nScientists at the University of California, San Francisco, led the study,\npublished\nMonday in JAMA Neurology. They analyzed the medical records of veterans, finding that dementia rates were noticeably higher in the Southeast, Northwest, and other regions, even after accounting for some possible factors like income. The findings suggest that deep-seated regional differences can contribute to dementia risk, the researchers say.\nDementia is a growing public health issue, particularly among the elderly. More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia currently and a government-funded study this February\nprojected\nthat 42% of Americans over 55 will develop it in their lifetime.\nGot Cold Sores? You Might Be at Higher Risk for Alzheimer\u2019s\nIt\u2019s a complex condition, with most cases caused by a mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. But according to senior study author and neurologist Kristine Yaffe, there\u2019s been little research looking at how the risk of dementia can vary geographically, at least on a national level. Yaffe and her team had access to a dataset that had the potential to shed light on that: deidentified records from people enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S.\n\u201cWe realized the VA national data would allow for such an investigation as the VA has a uniform way of capturing data across the U.S.,\u201d Yaffe, who is also chief of neuropsychiatry at the San Francisco VA healthcare system, told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cThere are no other national healthcare systems that have this.\u201d\nYaffe\u2019s team studied the health of more than 1.2 million randomly selected VA patients 65 years and older who had no pre-existing dementia. These people were followed for an average length of 12 years.\nAfter adjusting for age, dementia rates were lowest in the Mid-Atlantic region, covering states like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Using this as a baseline, the researchers found that dementia rates were 25% higher in the Southeast (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama); 23% higher in both the Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) and the Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas); 18% higher in the South (Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana); 13% higher in the Southwest (California, Nevada, and Arizona); and 7% in the Northeast (New York).\n\u201cThis is a very large difference, especially given that these are all veterans with care at the VAHS,\u201d Yaffe said. \u201cIt was really surprising we saw such big differences.\u201d\nJunk Food Is Filling Our Brains With Microplastics, Raising Mental Health Risks, Scientists Warn\nThe researchers reasoned that factors such as a person\u2019s average level of education, how rural a state was, or the rate of other health conditions like heart disease within these states might explain most of the variance they found. But even when they adjusted for these variables, the patterns barely budged at all. That could mean there are other reasons\u2014reasons not so easily captured through medical records alone\u2014why someone in New Jersey will tend to have a lower risk of dementia than a similar person in Kentucky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the differences are explained by lifelong differences in things like education quality (vs quantity) and social determinants of health might be driving some of the differences,\u201d Yaffe said.\nThe findings now leave open more questions to be answered, which the team plans to start digging into. With any luck, the lessons they learn might help us find new ways to better prevent dementia.\nAlzheimer's disease\ndementia\nDaily Newsletter\nYou May Also Like\nLatest news\nTony Gilroy Knows \u2018Andor\u2019 Broke the Heart of Cassian and Jyn Shippers\nThe Latest \u2018Sinners\u2019 Deleted Scene Showcases a New Musical Number\nDespite Feud, Trump Says He\u2019ll Stick With Starlink at White House\nLive Updates From Apple WWDC 2025 \ud83d\udd34\nIf You Own a Phone and a Laptop, This 24,000mAh Power Bank at 40% Off Replaces All Your Cables\nIndiana Jones Goes on an All-New Adventure in September\nRoborock Smart Robot Drops from $599 to $159, Amazon Clears Stock at an All-Time Low\nApple Intelligence Can Now Creep on Your iPhone Screen\nDownload Hub\nBest VPN\nBest Free VPN\nBest Cheap VPN\nNordVPN Review\nExpressVPN Review\nPIA Review\nProtonVPN Review\nSurfshark Review\nSuper Bowl 2025\nUS Open 2024\nBest Cloud Storage\nBest Web Hosting\nAbout Gizmodo\nMode\nFollow us\nHome\nLatest\nTech\nReviews\nScience\nio9\nAI\nVideo\nDeals\nHow to Tip Gizmodo\nAbout Gizmodo\nDownload Hub\nBest VPN\nBest Free VPN\nBest Cheap VPN\nNordVPN Review\nExpressVPN Review\nPIA Review\nProtonVPN Review\nSurfshark Review\nSuper Bowl 2025\nUS Open 2024\nBest Cloud Storage\nBest Web Hosting\nAbout Gizmodo\nMode\nFollow us\nCookies settings", "ped_digest": "P:Dementia rates vary significantly across U.S. states|Regional differences contribute to dementia risk|Dementia is a growing public health issue|Geographic location may shape brain health|Lifelong differences in education and social determinants may play a role;E:Study analyzed VA healthcare data|Researchers found higher dementia rates in Southeast, Northwest, and Rocky Mountains|Study projected 42% of Americans over 55 will develop dementia|Team studied health of over 1.2 million VA patients|Findings leave open more questions to be answered;D:More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia|42% of Americans over 55 projected to develop dementia|Study followed 1.2 million patients for an average of 12 years|Dementia rates 25% higher in Southeast|Dementia rates 23% higher in Northwest and Rocky Mountains|Dementia rates 18% higher in the South|Dementia rates 13% higher in the Southwest|Dementia rates 7% higher in the Northeast;", "er_digest": "N:JAMA Neurology|Veterans Health Administration;R:Virginia|Southeast|Southwest|Colorado|New York|Washington|Maryland|Louisiana|Idaho|Kentucky|Texas|Northwest|Rocky Mountains|Oregon|Nevada|Arizona|Alabama|Tennessee|New Mexico|Pennsylvania|California;", "gist": "P:Dementia rates vary significantly across U.S. states|Regional differences contribute to dementia risk|Dementia is a growing public health issue|Geographic location may shape brain health|Lifelong differences in education and social determinants may play a role;E:Study analyzed VA healthcare data|Researchers found higher dementia rates in Southeast, Northwest, and Rocky Mountains|Study projected 42% of Americans over 55 will develop dementia|Team studied health of over 1.2 million VA patients|Findings leave open more questions to be answered;D:More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia|42% of Americans over 55 projected to develop dementia|Study followed 1.2 million patients for an average of 12 years|Dementia rates 25% higher in Southeast|Dementia rates 23% higher in Northwest and Rocky Mountains|Dementia rates 18% higher in the South|Dementia rates 13% higher in the Southwest|Dementia rates 7% higher in the Northeast;N:JAMA Neurology|Veterans Health Administration;R:Virginia|Southeast|Southwest|Colorado|New York|Washington|Maryland|Louisiana|Idaho|Kentucky|Texas|Northwest|Rocky Mountains|Oregon|Nevada|Arizona|Alabama|Tennessee|New Mexico|Pennsylvania|California;", "entities": ["JAMA Neurology", "Veterans Health Administration"], "regions": ["Virginia", "Southeast", "Southwest", "Colorado", "New York", "Washington", "Maryland", "Louisiana", "Idaho", "Kentucky", "Texas", "Northwest", "Rocky Mountains", "Oregon", "Nevada", "Arizona", "Alabama", "Tennessee", "New Mexico", "Pennsylvania", "California"]}, {"_id": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farages-no2-plotting-wipe-35356453", "content": "\u200c\n\u200c\nSkip to main content\nNigel Farage's No2 plots 'reckless cuts worth more than NHS budget' as voters warned\nNigel Farage's No2, Richard Tice, has said he is plotting to slash public funding to 35% of GDP - which would wipe out a massive \u00a3275billion amid questions about Reform's NHS plans\nComments\nNews\nDave Burke\nPolitical Correspondent\n17:00, 08 Jun 2025\nUpdated 17:04, 08 Jun 2025\nRichard Tice has indicated he wants to cut huge sums from public spending\n(Image: Getty Images)\nNigel Farage's \"reckless\" economic plans would see the entire NHS,\narmed forces\n, police and criminal justice budgets wiped out, startling new analysis shows.\nComments by the Reform leader's No2 indicate the party wants to slash \u00a3274billion from government spending - more than five times Liz Truss's unfunded tax measures. Richard Tice, who is tipped as Mr Farage's choice for Chancellor, is accused of planning a dangerous \"game of roulette\".\n\u200c\nThe brutal analysis comes after Mr Tice hinted during a podcast recording he would take an axe to public spending, without saying what services he would cut. He told the Politics Inside Out podcast last week he would like to see the size of the state reduced to just over one-third of GDP with public spending down to 35% of GDP.\n\u200c\nThis would see a savage \u00a3274 billion cut from government budgets, based on current GDP figures. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, said: \u201cReckless Richard Tice would play a game of roulette with Britain\u2019s finances that would mean chaos, cuts and decline.\nREAD MORE:\nLabour minister hits back at X-rated chanting about Keir Starmer during England game\nLabour has warned of chaos if Reform gets its way\n(Image: PA)\n\u201c\nNigel Farage\nhas spoken openly about how Reform would finish\nNHS\nfunding through general taxation in favour of expensive healthcare insurance.\nArticle continues below\n\u201cNow whilst Farage announces more spending commitments, Tice shoots the breeze about choking off the funds for vital frontline services.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t tell us how any of this would work. We only know that it would lead to devastating cuts to our public services and provoke another financial crisis just like\nLiz Truss\n\u2019s mini\nBudget\n.\"\nBudget settlements from official Treasury figures in 2024 showed the public cash awarded to the NHS amounted to \u00a3188.5 billion. The\nMinistry of Defence\nreceives nearly \u00a354billion, the Home Office gets over \u00a320billion while Ministry of Justice funding comes in at almost \u00a312billion.\n\u200c\nPublic spending is currently around 45% of GDP. Mr Tice told the podcast, hosted by former Labour MP\nJonathan Ashworth\n: \"At 35% of GDP, things were working more. No one was saying back in the mid-nineties, to my recollection, the NHS is bust and broken and needs fundamental reform.\u201d\nReform's economic plans have been likened to Liz Truss's unfunded tax cuts\n(Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\nIt comes amid serious questions about how Reform plans to fund the NHS. In April Mr Farage declared: \"I do not want it [the NHS] funded through general taxation. It doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not working.\"\n\u200c\nLabour\nanalysis has shown that Reform\u2019s previously announced \u00a380billion of unfunded spending commitments could lead to an increase in mortgage payments for the average family by an eyewatering \u00a35,500 a year - with increased borrowing pushing up interest rates and bills.\nIt comes after Tory frontbencher Chris Philp, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury when Ms Truss announced her disastrous mini-Budget in 2022, also voiced alarm about Reform.\nHe told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Nigel Farage's team wants to go even bigger on unfunded tax cuts.\nArticle continues below\nREAD MORE:\nJoin our Mirror politics WhatsApp group to get the latest updates from Westminster\nFollow Daily Mirror:\nComments\n\u200c\n\u200c\nThe Treasury\nNHS\nMinistry of Justice\nHome Office\nMinistry of Defence\nLiz Truss\nDarren Jones\nNigel Farage\nFinancial crisis\nInterest rates\nPublic services\nPolitics\n\u200c\nAt\nReach and across our entities\nwe and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

But as far as traditions go, the Panthers are bringing the \u2018Heat\u2019 to their arena for the biggest series of the season.

Banging the famous Florida Panthers drum inside the Arena to get the game underway is a Panthers tradition, which is seen mostly during the Playoffs. Last year, in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, the Panthers brought Hockey Hall of Fame goalie\nRoberto Luongo\nto bang the drums.

He wore his old Panthers sweater and banged the drum to the chants of \u201cLet\u2019s Go Panthers!\u201d from the fans, as the Amerant Bank Arena turned electric before one of the biggest games in franchise history. And what do you know, the Panthers triumphed over the Oilers 2-1.\nAnd this time,\nMiami Heat\npower forward\nBam Adebayo\nis ready to do the honors. A fitting icon for our Stanley Cup Champion, Adebayo is a 3-time NBA All-Star. But what makes his presence special is his American heritage. The 6ft 9 in center is a 2-time Olympic Gold Medalist, and that is the telling move from the Panthers. It is national pride on the line. The Stanley Cup is being fought for between an American and a Canadian team.\nAnd if you thought the national aspect is just in the head, guess again. The Edmonton Oilers have played their cards, now it\u2019s the Panthers\u2019 turn.\nOilers\u2019 National Anthem tradition to start the 2025 Stanley Cup Finals\nThe first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals were in Rogers Place of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. And to sing the national anthems before the game, the Oilers entrusted their very own\nRobert Clark\nfor the esteemed duty. He was just the right man to get the fans ready and amped up for this crucial Stanley Cup series. This is, after all, a rematch of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.\nA defeat of the Oilers would be devastating, more so because they are the ones who have the great Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. Moreover, a Canadian team is trying to end the country\u2019s 32-year wait for a Stanley Cup. You can understand that so much is on the line. And Robert Clark is the right man to get things going.\nCredits \u2013 X / @NHL\nHe has obviously continued the legacy of Paul Lorieau, where he starts singing the Canadian national anthem, \u2018O Canada\u2019, but slowly lets the crowd take over from the \u201cwith glowing hearts\u201d verse. Basically, the whole Rogers Place ends the National Anthem, and that is the last thing before the puck drops. And Clark made it even more touching.\n\u201cWhen we first started doing it in 2017, we came together and thought that this would be an awesome tribute, but also let\u2019s make it our own, and to put me in the crowd,\u201d\nthe singer said to the Edmonton Journal in May 2025.\n\u201cPut together those two things, and the crowd goes crazy. They love being able to sing the Canadian anthem.\u201d\nOilers forward\nEvander Kane\nhad summed up how it adds the extra buzz needed to get the players dialed in:\n\u201cA Canadian crowd always has a little extra energy and buzz, and the anthem\u2019s the last thing before the puck drops, so it\u2019s definitely time to get the energy going and get everyone feeling excited and ready to go. He does a great job doing that.\u201d\nEach team is doing its bit for the Stanley Cup.

Like the National Guard troops, they are prohibited from conducting law enforcement activity such as making arrests unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which permits the president to use the military to end an insurrection or rebellion of federal power.\nThe Marines being activated are with 2nd battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine division, according to US Northern Command. The activation is \u201cintended to provide Task Force 51 with adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency,\u201d NORTHCOM said in statement, referring to US Army north\u2019s contingency command post.\nCNN\nRelated live story\nAbout 700 Marines being mobilized as California vows to sue Trump administration\nOne of the people familiar with the Marine mobilization said they will be augmenting the guard presence on the ground in LA. Over 2,000 members of the California National Guard have been activated by the president, but only about 300 have been deployed to the streets of LA so far. Those initial 300 people were on a routine National Guard drill weekend when they were mobilized, which is why they were able to arrive so quickly, the person familiar said; it can take up to 72 hours for other guardsmen to be mobilized. The Marines are expected to bolster some of the guard members who have been deployed to LA in the last two days, this person said.\nAnd while the person familiar stressed that the Marines were being deployed only to augment the forces already there, the image of US Marines mobilizing inside the United States will stand in contrast to National Guardsmen who more routinely respond to domestic issues. While some Marines have been assisting in border security at the southern border, one US official said Marines have not been mobilized within the US like they are in California now since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.\nWhile the Marines\u2019 tasks have not been specified publicly, they could include assignments like crowd control or establishing perimeter security. Lawyers within the Defense Department are also still finalizing language around the use-of-force guidelines for the troops being mobilized, but the person familiar said it will likely mirror the military\u2019s standing rules of the use of force.\nCalifornia Gov.

The prestigious announcement was made on Monday at a ceremony held at Abbey Road Studios in London, marking a moment of pride not just for her, but for the entire nation. Sana\u2019s induction is part of the ICC Hall of Fame Class of 2025. The honour celebrates her extraordinary contributions to the sport both on and off the field. She joins six other iconic cricketers from around the world in this year\u2019s list, further highlighting the significance of her recognition on the global stage. Sana Mir made her international debut in 2005. Over the next 15 years, she became one of Pakistan\u2019s most respected athletes, playing a total of 226 international matches. She quickly emerged as a powerful force in women\u2019s cricket, becoming a symbol of strength and resilience for women across the country. In 2018, she reached the top of the ICC Women\u2019s ODI Bowling Rankings, an achievement unmatched by any other Pakistani woman cricketer to date. She remains one of only nine women in the history of ODIs to have scored over 1,000 runs and taken more than 100 wickets \u2014 a rare and prestigious double in international cricket. As captain, Sana led Pakistan in two Women\u2019s World Cups and five ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cups. Her leadership brought glory to Pakistan at the Asian Games, where her team won gold medals in both 2010 and 2014. Her tenure as captain not only brought results on the field but also helped elevate the profile of women\u2019s cricket in Pakistan. Sana\u2019s journey holds even more significance when viewed against the backdrop of Pakistan\u2019s sporting culture. She began her cricketing path at a time when girls were not allowed to play in public parks or open grounds. Opportunities for women in sports were scarce, and societal attitudes presented constant challenges. Yet, Sana persevered. Her rise through the ranks changed perceptions, offering young girls a new role model to look up to and encouraging many to pick up a bat and ball for the first time. She became a beacon of hope for female athletes across the country. Beyond cricket, Sana has used her platform to raise awareness on important social issues. The ICC praised her advocacy against body shaming and her efforts to promote mental health. During the Covid-19 pandemic, she was actively involved in initiatives to support affected communities. Her work off the field has won her admiration and respect worldwide, further cementing her legacy as more than just a cricketer. In an emotional statement, Sana expressed her gratitude for the honour. She said that as a young girl she never imagined such a day would come, especially during a time when there was no women\u2019s team in Pakistan. Her induction, she said, was something beyond her dreams. She thanked her teammates, coaches, and family for their support and pledged to continue contributing to the sport in whatever way she could. This year\u2019s ICC Hall of Fame class includes several cricketing legends from around the world. India\u2019s MS Dhoni, known for his calm leadership and his unmatched ability to finish games, was recognised for his achievements, including leading India to victory in the T20 World Cup in 2007, the 50-over World Cup in 2011, and the Champions Trophy in 2013 \u2014 making him the only captain to win all three ICC white-ball titles. Australia\u2019s Matthew Hayden, a dominant Test opener with 30 centuries and an average of over 50, was also inducted. South Africa\u2019s Hashim Amla, renowned for his elegant stroke play and consistency in all conditions, was another name on the list. Graeme Smith, also from South Africa, was acknowledged for his leadership and success as one of the most accomplished Test captains in cricket history. New Zealand\u2019s Daniel Vettori, a reliable all-rounder and leader, was praised for his steady performances and commitment to the game. England\u2019s Sarah Taylor, widely regarded as one of the most naturally talented female cricketers of recent times, was celebrated for her stylish batting and world-class wicketkeeping. Speaking at the event, ICC Chairman Jay Shah applauded all the inductees. He said the ICC Hall of Fame honours the greatest players the game has produced \u2014 those who have left a lasting impact on cricket\u2019s history and inspired generations. He congratulated all seven inductees and said their inclusion was a testament to their dedication and excellence. For Pakistan, Sana Mir\u2019s induction into the ICC Hall of Fame is a proud and emotional moment. It signifies the growing presence of Pakistani women in international sports and opens the door for the next generation of athletes. Her journey \u2014 from playing in narrow streets with limited resources to becoming one of the most respected figures in world cricket \u2014 serves as a powerful reminder that with talent, courage, and perseverance, dreams can come true. Her story will continue to inspire, motivate, and lead the way for girls who dare to dream beyond boundaries.\nThe post\nSana Mir joins cricket\u2019s elite in ICC Hall of Fame\nappeared first on\nMinute Mirror\n.", "ped_digest": "P:First Pakistani woman inducted into ICC Hall of Fame|Celebrates extraordinary contributions to cricket|Symbol of strength and resilience for women in Pakistan|Beacon of hope for female athletes|Advocacy against body shaming and promotion of mental health;E:Induction into ICC Hall of Fame Class of 2025|International debut in 2005|Reached top of ICC Women\u2019s ODI Bowling Rankings in 2018|Led Pakistan in two Women\u2019s World Cups and five ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cups|Won gold medals at the Asian Games in 2010 and 2014|Awarded for leadership and success as a Test captain;D:Played 226 international matches|One of only nine women in ODI history to score over 1,000 runs and take more than 100 wickets|Led Pakistan to victory in Asian Games (2010, 2014)|MS Dhoni won T20 World Cup (2007), 50-over World Cup (2011), and Champions Trophy (2013)|Matthew Hayden scored 30 centuries with an average of over 50;", "er_digest": "N:Sarah Taylor|Matthew Hayden|Hashim Amla|Graeme Smith|Sana Mir|Jay Shah|ICC|Daniel Vettori|MS Dhoni;R:Pakistan|New Zealand|Australia|South Africa|England|India|London;", "gist": "P:First Pakistani woman inducted into ICC Hall of Fame|Celebrates extraordinary contributions to cricket|Symbol of strength and resilience for women in Pakistan|Beacon of hope for female athletes|Advocacy against body shaming and promotion of mental health;E:Induction into ICC Hall of Fame Class of 2025|International debut in 2005|Reached top of ICC Women\u2019s ODI Bowling Rankings in 2018|Led Pakistan in two Women\u2019s World Cups and five ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cups|Won gold medals at the Asian Games in 2010 and 2014|Awarded for leadership and success as a Test captain;D:Played 226 international matches|One of only nine women in ODI history to score over 1,000 runs and take more than 100 wickets|Led Pakistan to victory in Asian Games (2010, 2014)|MS Dhoni won T20 World Cup (2007), 50-over World Cup (2011), and Champions Trophy (2013)|Matthew Hayden scored 30 centuries with an average of over 50;N:Sarah Taylor|Matthew Hayden|Hashim Amla|Graeme Smith|Sana Mir|Jay Shah|ICC|Daniel Vettori|MS Dhoni;R:Pakistan|New Zealand|Australia|South Africa|England|India|London;", "entities": ["Sarah Taylor", "Matthew Hayden", "Hashim Amla", "Graeme Smith", "Sana Mir", "Jay Shah", "ICC", "Daniel Vettori", "MS Dhoni"], "regions": ["Pakistan", "New Zealand", "Australia", "South Africa", "England", "India", "London"]}, {"_id": "https://globalnews.ca/news/11229397/donald-trump-travel-ban-countries-airports-visas/", "content": "SKIP TO MAIN CONTENT\nIn the news\nDefence Spending\nWorld Juniors\nGreta Thunberg\nDr. Phil\nGlobal News Home\nSubscribe\nSite theme toggle.

Budowich\n, the D.C. Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction that required the White House to let the AP back into White House, Air Force One, and Mar-a-Lago briefings. Judge Neomi Rao, joined by Judge Greg Katsas, wrote a statement explaining the ruling; here's a short excerpt from the 27-page opinion.\nThe Associated Press wants to be in the room where it happens. But in February 2025, White House officials excluded the AP from the Oval Office and other restricted spaces. Officials announced that access was denied because the AP continued to use the name Gulf of Mexico in its Stylebook, rather than the President's preferred Gulf of America. The AP sued, alleging that its exclusion violated the First Amendment. The district court held the AP was likely to succeed on its constitutional claims, and it issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting White House officials from denying, on the basis of viewpoint, access to press events held in the Oval Office, on Air Force One, and at the President's home in Mar-a-Lago.\nWe grant in part the government's motion for a stay pending appeal. The White House is likely to succeed on the merits because these restricted presidential spaces are not First Amendment fora opened for private speech and discussion. The White House therefore retains discretion to determine, including on the basis of viewpoint, which journalists will be admitted. Moreover, without a stay, the government will suffer irreparable harm because the injunction impinges on the President's independence and control over his private workspaces\u2026.\nReporters and photographers have long been permitted access to the White House complex to cover the President and his administration. The White House manages access by requiring journalists to obtain a press credential called a hard pass. More than one thousand journalists hold hard passes, through which they may access spaces such as the James S. Brady Briefing Room, where the White House Press Secretary delivers regular briefings.\nHard pass holders may also sign up via a reservation system to attend larger events hosted in the East Room, which is often used for meetings with foreign leaders, executive order signings, and press conferences. Because the White House has opened these press facilities \"to all bona fide Washington-based journalists,\" hard passes may not be denied arbitrarily or based on the content of a journalist's speech.\nSherrill v. Knight\n(D.C. Cir. 1977).\nA small subset (around one percent) of hard pass holders is sometimes invited into even more restricted White House spaces, such as the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room. This group of privileged journalists, referred to as the \"press pool,\" has historically been selected by the White House Correspondents' Association, a private organization of which the AP is a founding member. Since its inception, the press pool has had a relatively stable, although not fixed, membership. Journalists selected to be part of the press pool may travel with the President aboard Air Force One and attend small press events at the President's home in Mar-a-Lago, usually to observe presidential speeches and events. For many years, the Correspondents' Association offered the AP a standing invitation to send one reporter and one photographer to press pool events.\nOn February 11, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt informed the AP that it would not be permitted in the Oval Office or press pool unless it revised its Stylebook to refer to the Gulf of America, which President Trump had recently renamed from the Gulf of Mexico. The President and other senior White House officials publicly stated that the reason for the AP's exclusion was its continued use of the name Gulf of Mexico. The AP was similarly excluded from events in the East Room, despite signing up in advance through the reservation process. On February 25, the White House announced it would select journalists for participation in press pool events, instead of deferring to the selection made by the Correspondents' Association\u2026.\nThe district court held the Oval Office, Air Force One, and similar restricted spaces are nonpublic fora when members of the press pool are present, and therefore the AP's exclusion on the basis of viewpoint violates the First Amendment. We conclude the spaces to which the AP seeks access are not any type of forum. As such, the White House may consider journalists' viewpoints when deciding whether to grant access\u2026.\n\"A nonpublic forum is government property that is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication.\" The government, \"no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\" Government property does not become a nonpublic forum unless and until the government takes some affirmative step to open the space for private communication. While the government need not open up property \"that is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication,\" the government \"creates a nonpublic forum when it provides selective access for individual speakers.\" Until the government opens a restricted space to private speech between private parties, such a space is not a First Amendment forum at all.\nOur cases provide guideposts for applying forum analysis to spaces in the White House. When the White House opens its facilities to the press generally, as it does in the Brady Briefing Room, it cannot exclude journalists based on viewpoint.\nSherill v. Knight\n.\nOn the other hand, we have never suggested that there are any First Amendment restrictions on \"the discretion of the President to grant interviews or briefings with selected journalists.\"\nSherrill\n. In deciding which journalists to speak with, the President may of course take into account their viewpoint. If President Trump sits down for an interview with Laura Ingraham, he is not required to do the same with Rachel Maddow. The First Amendment does not control the President's discretion in choosing with whom to speak or to whom to provide personal access. It is a time honored and entirely mundane aspect of our competitive and free press that public officials \"regularly subject all reporters to some form of differential treatment based on whether they approve of the reporters' expression.\"\nThe Baltimore Sun Co. v. Ehrlich\n(4th Cir. 2006).\nThese uncontested principles provide the framework for assessing the AP's claim that the Oval Office and other restricted spaces become nonpublic fora when the White House selects a small group of journalists (such as the press pool) to be present for observational newsgathering and reporting.\n{While viewpoint discrimination is often unconstitutional, we reject the dissent's primary argument that the White House's viewpoint-based exclusion of the AP is per se unconstitutional. This blanket conclusion finds no support in our First Amendment jurisprudence, which carefully assesses the type of government property at issue and recognizes that some government spaces are not fora at all and therefore are not subject to prohibitions on viewpoint discrimination.} \u2026\nThe Oval Office is the President's office, over which he has absolute control and discretion to exclude the public or members of the press. As the district court explained, the Oval Office \"is a highly controlled location \u2026 shrouded behind a labyrinth of security protocols,\" which \"few members of the public will ever\" enter. The President uses the space for myriad purposes, including speeches, signing ceremonies, and meetings with senior officials or heads of state. When events in the Oval Office are broadcast to the public, they feature the President's speech and expressive activity.\nIt hardly needs to be said that the Oval Office, Air Force One, or even the East Room are not places \"traditionally open to assembly and debate,\" nor are they open to the public for expressive activity. The parties agree the White House could, consistent with the First Amendment, exclude press from these spaces entirely.\nThe AP's primary contention, however, is that when the Oval Office and similar spaces are opened to the press pool, they become nonpublic fora and therefore the White House may not withhold access on the basis of viewpoint. We disagree\u2026.\n[T]he press events to which the AP seeks access do not involve the type of communicative activities that transform a restricted government space into a nonpublic forum. \"[F]orum analysis applies only to communicative activities.\" In each of the Supreme Court's forum analysis cases, the activity triggering application of the doctrine involved \"assembly, the exchange of ideas to and among citizens, the discussion of public issues, the dissemination of information and opinion, and debate\u2014all of which are communicative activities.\" Where, as here, a small group of journalists is permitted to attend events in restricted White House spaces like the Oval Office, the primary activity is observational newsgathering\u2026. Newsgathering may enjoy some First Amendment protections from government interference. But newsgathering is not itself a communicative activity. When journalists are invited to observe events in the Oval Office, they are gathering information for their reporting, which is \"a noncommunicative step in the production of speech.\" \u2026\n[T]hese spaces should [also] not be classified as nonpublic fora because access to them is tightly controlled and highly selective. Only about one percent of hard pass holders can fit in spaces like the Oval Office. When access to government property is very limited, considerations of viewpoint may be permissible\u2026.\n{Both the AP and the district court at various points suggest that if the White House maintains something like the press pool, it must allow access on a viewpoint neutral basis. For the reasons already explained, a group of journalists observing presidential events is not a forum of any sort. Accordingly, the White House should not have to choose between excluding all journalists and admitting journalists under the restrictions of a nonpublic forum. By recognizing the distinctions between different fora \"we encourage the government to open its property to some expressive activity in cases where, if faced with an all-or-nothing choice, it might not open the property at all.\"}\nFinally, the fact that the President is communicating at these events further distances this context from forum analysis. When the government is speaking, forum analysis is usually inapplicable because while the First Amendment \"restricts government regulation of private speech[,] it does not regulate government speech.\"\nAlthough the White House disclaims primary reliance on the government speech doctrine, the events to which the AP seeks access by their nature involve presidential, i.e. government, speech. The messages conveyed in the Oval Office are government speech and opportunities for the President's administration to express its message. \"When government speech is involved, forum analysis does not apply and the Government may favor or espouse a particular viewpoint.\" Forum analysis is also inappropriate when government speech occurs within a limited space, such as the Oval Office, the \"essential function\" of which would be defeated by compelling the President to support private speech on a viewpoint-neutral basis.\n{The district court relied heavily on a Seventh Circuit decision, which concluded that an \"invitation-only, limited-access press event\" hosted by the governor of Wisconsin was a nonpublic forum.\nSee John K. MacIver Inst. for Public Policy, Inc. v. Evers\n(7th Cir. 2021). In that case, however, while the Governor argued that his press events were likely not a forum at all, he acknowledged that nonpublic forum analysis \"might apply\" under the circumstances. Without explanation, the Seventh Circuit held \"the non-public forum analysis is the appropriate one\" and concluded that the Governor's access policies were constitutional even under this more demanding standard. The case is therefore of limited relevance to the inquiry here, where the parties dispute whether these spaces are fora at all.}\nThe panel majority's opinion also rejected, for similar reasons, the AP's claim that it was impermissibly retaliated against based on its viewpoint:\nChoosing who may observe or possibly speak with the President in these spaces is not the type of action that supports a retaliation claim. Rather, it is more akin to a decision about how the President wields the bully pulpit\n.\n{Our dissenting colleague emphasizes that the denial of a government benefit based on speech is often actionable. While this is generally true, the press pool is in no way a government benefit program. Denying unemployment benefits, tax exemptions, or trademarks on the basis of viewpoint can support a First Amendment retaliation claim. Denying access to observe or speak with the President in his private spaces cannot. The dissent acknowledges that the President may take viewpoint into account when granting interviews to select journalists. Our holding today reflects the fact that granting access to spaces such as the Oval Office is more like granting interviews than like denying unemployment benefits.}\nFurthermore, in determining whether a First Amendment retaliation claim is actionable, courts may be guided by \"long settled and established practice[s].\" White House staff, not to mention the President, often form relationships with reporters who cover the administration. Hard pass holders and press pool members daily jockey for access to certain privileged spaces and to senior administration officials. As the AP acknowledges (and the district court recognized), the White House can and does reward journalists with advantages like interviews with the President and the opportunity to ask questions at press events. Such viewpoint-based preferences occur at every level of government in the relationship between elected officials and the press. These pervasive practices simply do not give rise to a retaliation claim, regardless of how valuable the access may be\u2026.\nJudge Nina Pillard dissented; a short excerpt from her opinion (which is also 27 pages long):\nDefendants have not made the showing critical to their stay application that they are likely to succeed in establishing that the First Amendment allows them to oust journalists from the White House Press Pool based on their employing organization's viewpoint. Forum analysis readily confirms that failure. My colleagues' effort to distinguish forum analysis is nonetheless beside the point because the bar on viewpoint discrimination in nonpublic forums for private speech is but one iteration of a broader First Amendment principle strongly supportive of the AP's claims.\nThe majority's defense of defendants' viewpoint-based exclusion of the AP from the Press Pool utterly disregards that broader principle. So, too, does its assumption that the AP's retaliation claim is likely to fail. Denial of a tangible benefit in retaliation for a recipient's own viewpoint expressed elsewhere violates the First Amendment\u2026.\nThe prohibition on viewpoint discrimination applies equally to the imposition of penalties and the denial of benefits. The government may not condition receipt of any otherwise-available benefit or opportunity on a recipient's endorsement or avoidance of a particular viewpoint. That rule applies to government benefits generally, including federal funding, tax exemptions, trademarks, government contracts, and public-sector employment. Even where a government program is designed to support a small number of speakers selected on discretionary, aesthetic criteria, it may not impose restrictions intended to punish \"certain ideas or viewpoints.\"\nNEA v. Finley\n(1998). And even discretionary support to public broadcasters cannot be allocated to \"curtail expression of a particular point of view.\"\nFCC v. League of Women Voters\n(1984)\u2026.\nThe President's use of the Oval Office as a platform for his official speech does not entail governmental authority to impose viewpoint restrictions on the Press Pool. Even where the government funds private organizations to advance official policy and therefore can control the viewpoint expressed within the funded program, it may not deny support based on disapproval of the recipient's speech outside that program. The government may not require private participants to \"adopt\u2014as their own\u2014the Government's view on an issue of public concern as a condition of funding.\" That is why the Supreme Court in\nAgency for International Development\nheld that the government violated the First Amendment rights of an organization receiving public support to advance the government's HIV/AIDS prevention mission when it required the organization to echo the government's opposition to prostitution in the organization's own work with its own funds.\nId\n. at 218-21. The rule that public funds may be limited to the purpose for which they are granted does not empower the government to impose viewpoint restrictions on grantees' private speech.\nWhatever my colleagues mean by emphasizing that Oval Office events \"involve\" governmental speech because the President typically speaks there, the Press Pool's coverage of those events\u2014let alone the content of the AP's Stylebook\u2014is not governmental speech legitimately subject to official viewpoint control. My colleagues are also wrong that the \"essential function\" of the Oval Office is \"defeated\" by the presence of a Press Pool free from viewpoint discrimination. The Press Pool has operated without viewpoint control for almost a century during which presidents have communicated directly from the Oval Office. The purpose of the Press Pool has never been to propagandize for the President, but only to enable reliable news coverage of his leadership. Public officials' prerogative to speak for the government does not include any ability to control private parties' speech on their own behalf, even when that speech relates to the government's message\u2026.\nDefendants' (and the majority's) principal argument is that the President has unlimited discretion to pick \"which journalists to grant special access unavailable to other members of the press corps.\" Their sole precedent is\nBaltimore Sun Co. v. Ehrlich\n(4th Cir. 2006), which is both inapposite and not binding on this court. The plaintiff journalists in\nBaltimore Sun\nobjected to government officials' refusal to grant them interviews or return their calls. Judicial relief would have required the defendants to speak with certain reporters. Any such command would have strained the basic principle that \"[t]he First Amendment's Free Speech Clause does not prevent the government from declining to express a view,\" and that the government may choose for itself \"what to say and what not to say.\"\nThe AP does not assert a right to have the President return its phone calls, or to \"interact and speak with government officials.\" What the AP challenges is its reporters' and photographers' exclusion from a government program for which it is otherwise fully eligible and has long participated, based solely on the AP's own expression in its Stylebook and reporting\u2026.\nThe government is represented by lawyers Daniel Tenny, Eric Dean McArthur, Mark Reiling Freeman, and Steven Andrew Myers (Justice Department) and Jane M. Lyons (D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office).\nThe post\nNo First Amendment Violation in Excluding Associated Press from \"the Room Where It Happens\"\nappeared first on\nReason.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:D.C.

Sign up to receive [our biggest stories](https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=www.propublica.org&placement=top-note&region=national) as soon as they\u2019re published.\nWhen an AI script written by a Department of Government Efficiency employee came across a contract for internet service, it flagged it as cancelable. Not because it was waste, fraud or abuse \u2014 the Department of Veterans Affairs needs internet connectivity after all \u2014 but because the model was given unclear and conflicting instructions.\nSahil Lavingia, who wrote the code, told it to cancel, or in his words \u201cmunch,\u201d anything that wasn\u2019t \u201cdirectly supporting patient care.\u201d Unfortunately, neither Lavingia nor the model had the knowledge required to make such determinations.\n\u201cI think that mistakes were made,\u201d said Lavingia, who worked at DOGE for nearly two months, in an interview with ProPublica. \u201cI\u2019m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\u201d\nIt turns out, a lot of mistakes were made as DOGE and the VA rushed to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s [February executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/) mandating all of the VA\u2019s contracts be reviewed within 30 days.\nProPublica obtained the code and prompts \u2014 the instructions given to the AI model \u2014 used to review the contracts and interviewed Lavingia and experts in both AI and government procurement. We are publishing an analysis of those prompts to help the public understand how this technology is being deployed in the federal government.\n[The experts found numerous and troubling flaws](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-veterans-affairs-ai-contracts-health-care): the code relied on older, general-purpose models not suited for the task; the model hallucinated contract amounts, deciding around 1,100 of the agreements were each worth $34 million when they were sometimes worth thousands; and the AI did not analyze the entire text of contracts. Most experts said that, in addition to the technical issues, using off-the-shelf AI models for the task \u2014 with little context on how the VA works \u2014 should have been a nonstarter.\nLavingia, a software engineer enlisted by DOGE, acknowledged there were flaws in what he created and blamed, in part, a lack of time and proper tools. He also stressed that he knew his list of what he called \u201cMUNCHABLE\u201d contracts would be vetted by others before a final decision was made.\nPortions of the prompt are pasted below along with commentary from experts we interviewed. Lavingia published a complete version of it on his [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/slavingia/va/blob/35e3ff1b9e0eb1c8aaaebf3bfe76f2002354b782/contracts/process_contracts.py#L235-L325).\nProblems with how the model was constructed can be detected from the very opening lines of code, where the DOGE employee instructs the model how to behave:\nThis part of the prompt, known as a system prompt, is intended to shape the overall behavior of the large language model, or LLM, the technology behind AI bots like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). In this case, it was used before both steps of the process: first, before Lavingia used it to obtain information like contract amounts; then, before determining if a contract should be canceled.\nIncluding information not related to the task at hand can confuse AI. At this point, it\u2019s only being asked to gather information from the text of the contract. Everything related to \u201cmunchable status,\u201d \u201csoft-services\u201d or \u201cDEI\u201d is irrelevant. Experts told ProPublica that trying to fix issues by adding more instructions can actually have the opposite effect \u2014 especially if they\u2019re irrelevant.\nThe models were only shown the first 10,000 characters from each document, or approximately 2,500 words. Experts were confused by this, noting that OpenAI models support inputs over 50 times that size. Lavingia said that he had to use an older AI model that the VA had already signed a contract for.\nThis portion of the prompt instructs the AI to extract the contract number and other key details of a contract, such as the \u201ctotal contract value.\u201d\nThis was error-prone and not necessary, as accurate contract information can already be found in publicly available databases like [USASpending](https://www.usaspending.gov/). In some cases, this led to the AI system being given an outdated version of a contract, which led to it reporting a misleadingly large contract amount. In other cases, the model mistakenly pulled an irrelevant number from the page instead of the contract value.\n\u201cThey are looking for information where it\u2019s easy to get, rather than where it\u2019s correct,\u201d said Waldo Jaquith, a former Obama appointee who oversaw IT contracting at the Treasury Department. \u201cThis is the lazy approach to gathering the information that they want. It\u2019s faster, but it\u2019s less accurate.\u201d\nLavingia acknowledged that this approach led to errors but said that those errors were later corrected by VA staff.\nOnce the program extracted this information, it ran a second pass to determine if the contract was \u201cmunchable.\u201d\nAgain, only the first 10,000 characters were shown to the model. As a result, the munchable determination was based purely on the first few pages of the contract document.\nThe above prompt section is the first set of instructions telling the AI how to flag contracts. The prompt provides little explanation of what it\u2019s looking for, failing to define what qualifies as \u201ccore medical/benefits\u201d and lacking information about what a \u201cnecessary consultant\u201d is.\nFor the types of models the DOGE analysis used, including all the necessary information to make an accurate determination is critical.\nCary Coglianese, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies the governmental use of artificial intelligence, said that knowing which jobs could be done in-house \u201ccalls for a very sophisticated understanding of medical care, of institutional management, of availability of human resources\u201d that the model does not have.\nThe prompt above tries to implement a fundamental policy of the Trump administration: killing all DEI programs. But the prompt fails to include a definition of what DEI is, leaving the model to decide.\nDespite the instruction to cancel DEI-related contracts, very few were flagged for this reason. Procurement experts noted that it\u2019s very unlikely for information like this to be found in the first few pages of a contract.\nThese two lines \u2014 which experts say were poorly defined \u2014 carried the most weight in the DOGE analysis. The response from the AI frequently cited these reasons as the justification for munchability. Nearly every justification included a form of the phrase \u201cdirect patient care,\u201d and in a third of cases the model flagged contracts because it stated the services could be handled in-house.\nThe poorly defined requirements led to several contracts for VA office internet services being flagged for cancellation. In one justification, the model had this to say:\n> The contract provides data services for internet connectivity, which is an IT infrastructure service that is multiple layers removed from direct clinical patient care and could likely be performed in-house, making it classified as munchable.\nDespite these instructions, AI flagged many audit- and compliance-related contracts as \u201cmunchable,\u201d labeling them as \u201csoft services.\u201d\nIn one case, the model even acknowledged the importance of compliance while flagging a contract for cancellation, stating: \u201cAlthough essential to ensuring accurate medical records and billing, these services are an administrative support function (a \u2018soft service\u2019) rather than direct patient care.\u201d\nShobita Parthasarathy, professor of public policy and director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at University of Michigan, told ProPublica that this piece of the prompt was notable in that it instructs the model to \u201cdistinguish\u201d between the two types of services without instructing the model what to save and what to kill.\nThe emphasis on \u201cdirect patient care\u201d is reflected in how often the AI cited it in its recommendations, even when the model did not have any information about a contract. In one instance where it labeled every field \u201cnot found,\u201d it still decided the contract was munchable. It gave this reason:\n> Without evidence that it involves essential medical procedures or direct clinical support, and assuming the contract is for administrative or related support services, it meets the criteria for being classified as munchable.\nIn reality, this contract was for the preventative maintenance of important safety devices known as ceiling lifts at VA medical centers, including three sites in Maryland. The contract itself stated:\n> Ceiling Lifts are used by employees to reposition patients during their care. They are critical safety devices for employees and patients, and must be maintained and inspected appropriately.\nThis portion of the prompt attempts to define \u201csoft services.\u201d It uses many highly specific examples but also throws in vague categories without definitions like \u201cnon-performing/non-essential contracts.\u201d\nExperts said that in order for a model to properly determine this, it would need to be given information about the essential activities and what\u2019s required to support them.\nThis section of the prompt was the result of analysis by Lavingia and other DOGE staff, Lavingia explained. \u201cThis is probably from a session where I ran a prior version of the script that most likely a DOGE person was like, \u2018It\u2019s not being aggressive enough.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why it starts with a 2. I guess I disagreed with one of them, and so we only put 2, 3 and 4 here.\u201d\nNotably, our review found that the only clarifications related to past errors were related to scenarios where the model wasn\u2019t flagging enough contracts for cancellation.\nThis section of the prompt provides the most detail about what constitutes \u201cdirect patient care.\u201d While it does cover many aspects of care, it still leaves a lot of ambiguity and forces the model to make its own judgements about what constitutes \u201cproven efficacy\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d medical equipment.\nIn addition to the limited information given on what constitutes direct patient care, there is no information about how to determine if a price is \u201creasonable,\u201d especially since the LLM only sees the first few pages of the document. The models lack knowledge about what\u2019s normal for government contracts.\n\u201cI just do not understand how it would be possible. This is hard for a human to figure out,\u201d Jaquith said about whether AI could accurately determine if a contract was reasonably priced. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way that an LLM could know this without a lot of really specialized training.\u201d\nThis section explicitly lists which tasks could be \u201ceasily insourced\u201d by VA staff, and more than 500 different contracts were flagged as \u201cmunchable\u201d for this reason.\n\u201cA larger issue with all of this is there seems to be an assumption here that contracts are almost inherently wasteful,\u201d Coglianese said when shown this section of the prompt. \u201cOther services, like the kinds that are here, are cheaper to contract for. In fact, these are exactly the sorts of things that we would not want to treat as \u2018munchable.\u2019\u201d He went on to explain that insourcing some of these tasks could also \u201csiphon human sources away from direct primary patient care.\u201d\nIn an interview, Lavingia acknowledged some of these jobs might be better handled externally. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to cut the ones that would make the VA less efficient or cause us to hire a bunch of people in-house,\u201d Lavingia explained. \u201cWhich currently they can\u2019t do because there\u2019s a hiring freeze.\u201d\nThe VA is standing behind its use of AI to examine contracts, calling it \u201ca commonsense precedent.\u201d And documents obtained by ProPublica suggest the VA is looking at additional ways AI can be deployed. A March email from a top VA official to DOGE stated:\n> Today, VA receives over 2 million disability claims per year, and the average time for a decision is 130 days. We believe that key technical improvements (including AI and other automation), combined with Veteran-first process/culture changes pushed from our Secretary\u2019s office could dramatically improve this. A small existing pilot in this space has resulted in 3% of recent claims being processed in less than 30 days. Our mission is to figure out how to grow from 3% to 30% and then upwards such that only the most complex claims take more than a few days.\nIf you have any information about the misuse or abuse of AI within government agencies, reach out to us via our [Signal](https://www.propublica.org/tips/#signal) or [SecureDrop](https://www.propublica.org/tips/#securedrop) channels. \nIf you\u2019d like to talk to someone specific, Brandon Roberts is an investigative journalist on the news applications team and has a wealth of experience using and dissecting artificial intelligence.

Sure, the modern fans would know\nDana White\nas the face of the entire company. However, many might not know that the Gracie family was the promotion\u2019s founding fathers.\nRorion Gracie\n, along with\nArt Davie\nand\nBob Meyrowitz\n, launched their first event in 1993. And, who was the star at their inaugural event? It was none other than\nRoyce Gracie\nwho fought\nKen Shamrock\nat the Iconic McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado.\nTime flies. Here we are in 2025, streaming UFC events on our devices, watching the modern sport unfold. But there was one thread within the UFC that genuinely tried to keep the Gracie legacy and its rich history alive. Unfortunately, even that couldn\u2019t escape the unforgiving axe of the head honcho. This time, it found\nKron Gracie\n.\nDana White cuts Kron Gracie from the UFC\n\u201cI like Kron a lot, and he\u2019s a good kid. He came in very limited tonight. Very limited.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Dana White said at the UFC 288 press conference after Kron Gracie\u2019s loss to\nCharles Jourdain\n. It may have sounded like mellow criticism, but to many, it felt like a warning\u2014one more loss, and the grandson of legendary\nHelio Gracie\n\u2019s run could be over. And eventually, that\u2019s exactly what happened. After cutting\nHakeem Dawodu\nand\nConnor Matthews\n, Kron\u2019s name quietly joined the list.\nSadly, the 36-year-old suffered his third straight loss when he faced\nBryce Mitchell\nat UFC 310, marking a tough fall from his impressive debut win over\nAlex Caceres\nback in 2019. So, when the UFC Roster Watch account posted the update,\n\u201cFighter removed: Kron Gracie,\u201d\nit didn\u2019t exactly shock fight fans. By then, most had already seen it coming.\nFighter removed: Kron Gracie\n\u2014 UFC Roster Watch (@UFCRosterWatch)\nJune 9, 2025\nKron Gracie made a solid name for himself in the grappling world and even had a respectable run in RIZIN Fighting Federation. With so much history and pride behind his name, many believed he\u2019d be a force to be reckoned with in the UFC. But things didn\u2019t go as expected\u2014the Octagon proved to be too much for him. And this didn\u2019t just come out of nowhere. In fact, a veteran of the fight game had already predicted that would happen.\nJohn McCarthy predicted Kron getting cut from the UFC\nJohn McCarthy\nis one of the true OGs of MMA, having shaped the sport\u2019s landscape through his work in developing global rules. Over his career, he\u2019s officiated countless fights as a referee. So, when Kron Gracie faced Bryce Mitchell at UFC 310 and lost via elbows, McCarthy didn\u2019t hold back. The veteran ref offered sharp criticism and even predicted that Kron would soon be cut from the UFC.\nOn an episode of the\nWeighing in\nPodcast in 2024, right after UFC 310, McCarthy said,\n\u201cI think they release him. The experiment is gone, it doesn\u2019t matter what your name is when you\u2019re going to fight the way he did it. You\u2019ve got to say in the second round he came close, and he did. The arm bar was there for a second and it was good\u2026. You can\u2019t be a jiu-jitsu stylist who doesn\u2019t have any stand-up or true wrestling and you\u2019re going to pull guard and expect to win. It ain\u2019t going to happen, or at least it\u2019s very rare.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no denying that Kron Gracie has fallen short of MMA fans\u2019 expectations. He relied heavily on his Jiu-Jitsu skills, which just didn\u2019t cut it against the well-rounded fighters who used elbows and raw power to overwhelm him.

In a press conference on Monday, Trump\ntold reporters\nthat he is going to keep the Starlink internet connection that was installed at the presidential residence earlier this year, calling it \u201ca good service.\u201d\nTrump also threw some cold water on the idea that he was\ngoing to sell his Tesla\nthat he bought earlier this year as a favor to Musk while Tesla was the subject of protests and the company\u2019s stock was tanking. \u201cI may move the Tesla around a little bit,\u201d he , but he didn\u2019t say he intended to sell it. When asked what \u201cmoving it around\u201d means, Trump just said, \u201cI have a lot of locations.\u201d Okay! The Tesla is currently at the White House, where it\u2019s available for staffers to use.\nWhile Trump intends to keep Starlink connected at the White House, security experts sure wish he wouldn\u2019t. The service, which was reportedly installed by DOGE earlier this year,\nper the Washington Post\n, went up without the approval of the people who manage White House communications systems. They were unable to monitor activity on the network, which was only protected by a prompt asking users to provide a password. By comparison, the White House\u2019s primary WiFi network requires people to create a username and password in order to connect, and those accounts expire after one week. So, that\u2019s not ideal.\nTrump could use the security concerns as a way to ditch Musk, but he\u2019s really doing his best to remain cordial about the whole situation\u2014a shock for a guy who is not exactly known to be above petty potshots and insults. He went so far as to say on Monday, \u201cI wish him well. We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually.\u201d So while the two still aren\u2019t talking, Trump isn\u2019t fanning the flames.\nAnd while Trump may not be ditching his Musk-related equipment, the rest of the government may not be so loyal.\nThe Washington Post reported\nthis weekend that officials at both NASA and the Pentagon started pushing SpaceX competitors to step up and offer alternatives to the services provided by the Musk-backed venture. The reason isn\u2019t petty or vindictive, but rather safety-related: Musk threatened to decommission its Dragon spacecraft, which is essential for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station. The agencies simply can\u2019t rely on a guy who could just one day declare he\u2019s not going to complete an essential service they are counting on and contracted out to him.\nDonald Trump\nElon Musk\nNASA\nSPACEX\nStarlink\nDaily Newsletter\nYou May Also Like\nLatest news\nTony Gilroy Knows \u2018Andor\u2019 Broke the Heart of Cassian and Jyn Shippers\nThe Latest \u2018Sinners\u2019 Deleted Scene Showcases a New Musical Number\nDespite Feud, Trump Says He\u2019ll Stick With Starlink at White House\nLive Updates From Apple WWDC 2025 \ud83d\udd34\nIf You Own a Phone and a Laptop, This 24,000mAh Power Bank at 40% Off Replaces All Your Cables\nIndiana Jones Goes on an All-New Adventure in September\nRoborock Smart Robot Drops from $599 to $159, Amazon Clears Stock at an All-Time Low\nApple Intelligence Can Now Creep on Your iPhone Screen\nDownload Hub\nBest VPN\nBest Free VPN\nBest Cheap VPN\nNordVPN Review\nExpressVPN Review\nPIA Review\nProtonVPN Review\nSurfshark Review\nSuper Bowl 2025\nUS Open 2024\nBest Cloud Storage\nBest Web Hosting\nAbout Gizmodo\nMode\nFollow us\nHome\nLatest\nTech\nReviews\nScience\nio9\nAI\nVideo\nDeals\nHow to Tip Gizmodo\nAbout Gizmodo\nDownload Hub\nBest VPN\nBest Free VPN\nBest Cheap VPN\nNordVPN Review\nExpressVPN Review\nPIA Review\nProtonVPN Review\nSurfshark Review\nSuper Bowl 2025\nUS Open 2024\nBest Cloud Storage\nBest Web Hosting\nAbout Gizmodo\nMode\nFollow us\nCookies settings", "ped_digest": "P:Trump will keep Starlink at White House|Security experts concerned about Starlink's security|Trump may move Tesla but won't sell it|NASA and Pentagon seeking SpaceX alternatives;E:Trump press conference on Monday|Starlink installed at White House earlier this year|Musk threatened to decommission Dragon spacecraft|Washington Post reported NASA and Pentagon seeking alternatives;D:Starlink internet connection|Tesla|Dragon spacecraft|2025|One week (account expiration);", "er_digest": "N:Tony Gilroy|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|NASA;", "gist": "P:Trump will keep Starlink at White House|Security experts concerned about Starlink's security|Trump may move Tesla but won't sell it|NASA and Pentagon seeking SpaceX alternatives;E:Trump press conference on Monday|Starlink installed at White House earlier this year|Musk threatened to decommission Dragon spacecraft|Washington Post reported NASA and Pentagon seeking alternatives;D:Starlink internet connection|Tesla|Dragon spacecraft|2025|One week (account expiration);N:Tony Gilroy|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|NASA;", "entities": ["Tony Gilroy", "Donald Trump", "Elon Musk", "NASA"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/06/09/politics/state-politics/maine-democrats-challenge-donald-trumps-immigration-policies/", "content": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Democrats in the Maine Legislature advanced a bill Monday that challenges President Donald Trump by limiting police and jails from cooperating with federal immigration officials in many circumstances.\nThe bill from Rep. Deqa Dhalac, D-South Portland, was watered down significantly before it was voted out of the Judiciary Committee in a 7-6 vote in which Rep. Dani O\u2019Halloran, D-Brewer, voted with Republicans against the proposal. It now goes to the chambers for votes.\nIt will be the major test for Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies in the State House this year. Debates on how Maine police work with federal immigration agents have ramped up since Trump took office in January. The administration has faced numerous lawsuits over its efforts to\ndetain\nand deport people in Maine and other states, including students\nprotesting\nIsrael\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, despite them having legal status or applying for asylum.\nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol also said agents in April made\n113 arrests of people from\n16 countries who were allegedly in the country illegally. That was the highest monthly total in 24 years, and it is in keeping with\na national trend of increased arrests\nunder Trump.\nHelp us raise $40,000 to fund the BDN\u2019s\u00a0civic news mission this spring.\nLearn why we are asking and how to give\n.\nSome of those arrests began with traffic stops\ninitiated by Maine police\n, including one in February that led to the detention of a 17-year-old who recently reunited with his family in Lewiston after arriving in the U.S. years earlier as an unaccompanied minor. Certain Maine jails have long held people for immigration agents for\nno longer than 48 hours at a time\n.\nFormal agreements between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local police departments have been a hot topic in Augusta and communities across the state. The Wells Police Department\nrescinded its partnership\nwith the federal government after backlash from the liberal-leaning community.\nDhalac\u2019s bill was sweeping when it was introduced, aiming to stop Maine police agencies from holding anyone in response to immigration hold requests unless they are suspected of criminal activity. State employees other than police would have been able to inquire about immigration status except to provide services to them.\nThe bill\u2019s changes in the amendment came after various work sessions and feedback from officials such as Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen, who leads the Maine Chiefs of Police Association. Moen noted the earlier language could affect federal task forces, such as for drug enforcement, that are not primarily used for immigration enforcement.\nA new version of the bill responds to that criticism by allowing an exception for non-immigration police activity and removes the language about public employees. It still says police cannot hold someone solely based on an immigration hold request from a federal agency.\nThe Judiciary Committee\nheld off last week\non taking action on a\nseparate proposal\nfrom Rep. Ambureen Rana, D-Bangor, that would ban local and state police from contracting with ICE, instead pushing additional work on that measure to next year.\nRep.

Speaking to\nHome of Fight\n, Nicksick hinted that enough time has passed since Francis Ngannou\u2019s dramatic exit from the UFC for the two sides to bury the hatchet. According to him, it was never personal, it was business. And with heavyweight chaos still swirling, Nicksick believes the door is very much open. He even gave props to\nTom Aspinall\n, saying he fully deserves a title shot. However, nothing concrete about that bout has surfaced yet. Then comes the curveball: Francis Ngannou is still tied to the PFL, and that complicates everything.\nRemember, this all goes back to the fight that never was,\nJon Jones\nvs. Francis Ngannou. Back when Jonathan Dwight made his long-anticipated move from light heavyweight to heavyweight, Francis Ngannou had already walked away from the UFC, leaving that dream clash in the dust. Dana White even admitted in 2023,\n\u201cJon Jones wanted that fight the whole time. We tried to make the fight with Francis ]Ngannou]\u2026\u201d\nbut it never happened. And when Francis Ngannou signed with the PFL, it only widened the gap. But now, the rumor mill is spinning again, fueled in part by none other than\nJake Paul\n, who\u2019s not just a fighter but also a PFL co-owner.\n\u201cNo different than Mayweather McGregor. Two promotions coming together to put on a global event for the fans,\u201d\nhe wrote on X, teasing a possible cross-promotional mega-event, two years after the Cameroonian\u00a0famously parted ways with the UFC.\nThe PFL clearly wants this fight and badly. Why? Because a clash between Francis Ngannou and Jon Jones isn\u2019t just another bout; it\u2019s the heavyweight superfight fans have been dreaming about for years. Now, if you wonder why is Jake Paul referencing the 2017\nFloyd Mayweather\nvs.\nConor McGregor\ncrossover megafight, it\u2019s because that blockbuster fight (which earned Conor McGregor a whopping $130 million), co-promoted by UFC and Mayweather Promotions, proved that two different brands could come together for the right price and spectacle.\nNo different than Mayweather McGregor. Two promotions coming together to put on a global event for the fans.\n#JonesNgannou\nhttps://t.co/4w1RmPiZXj\n\u2014 Jake Paul (@jakepaul)\nJune 7, 2025\nAnd guess what? Jon Jones seems totally on board. Just days ago, the reigning UFC heavyweight champ took to X and posted a message that turned heads:\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing Francis Ngannou is still interested\u2026 now we\u2019re talking\u2026 Two kings from different roads. Not just one legend facing a mouth that\u2019s hot right now, but two real legacies colliding. That\u2019s the kind of fight that actually adds something special to my story.\nAt least from my point of view.\u201d\nAnd Francis Ngannou didn\u2019t waste time replying either.\n\u201cYou take care of the UFC, I\u2019ll take care of the PFL, and we\u2019ll finally find out who\u2019s the KING OF THE HEAVYWEIGHT.\n,\u201d\nhe wrote back. And to make things even juicier, PFL founder Donn Davis publicly laid out a wild offer:\n\u201cWINNER TAKE ALL\u2026 Francis Wins \u2026 @PFLMMA and Francis split 100% of the event profits. Jon Wins \u2026 @UFC and Jon split 100% of the event profits.\u201d\nWith both fighters aligned and Jake Paul pushing from the PFL side, this thing is practically gift-wrapped. On paper, at least.\nBut there\u2019s one problem, and fans aren\u2019t letting it slide. There\u2019s only one person who can give a green light to this historic showdown. And by the looks of it, he may not be feeling so generous. Who are we talking about here? It\u2019s the UFC Prez,\nDana White.\nAs Jake Paul wants Jon Jones vs. Francis Ngannou, is he dreaming big or just delusional?\nOne user nailed it with a blunt tweet:\n\u201cDana would never agree.\u201d\nAnother went even further, saying,\n\u201cLmao\u2026 Where is the PUBLIC apology to Dana? Who do you think you are? Wake up, Snake Paul\u2026 and PFL with their $25 tickets. Lolz.\u201d\nThe sentiment? Francis Ngannou burned a bridge when he left the UFC, pursued two high-profile boxing bouts, one with\nTyson Fury\nand the other with\nAnthony Joshua\n, and lost both, without ever making peace with the man who once signed his checks.\nAnd honestly, it\u2019s hard to ignore that perspective. Dana White has never been one to play nice with rival promotions, and fans know it. One user put it plainly:\n\u201cDana would never give another MMA promotion a chance to get views/business off the UFC\u2019s name. But as a fan, I\u2019d love that sh-t.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the catch-22 here! The UFC has very little to gain from this fight in terms of revenue or brand leverage, especially since PFL would reap the most attention. But from a fan\u2019s standpoint? A battle between Jon Jones and Francis Ngannou is pure MMA gold. And there are even whispers that this fight could be\n\u201cbigger than Mayweather vs. McGregor\u201d\nif done right.\nSource: Imago\nStill, not everyone\u2019s buying into Jake Paul\u2019s sales pitch. One user broke it down:\n\u201cExtremely different if Jones is bringing the belt. Also, it\u2019s the same sport\u2014not a different sport. This isn\u2019t happening.\u201d\nThe point here?\nFloyd Mayweather\nvs.\nConor McGregor\nworked because it was a novelty, a boxer vs. MMA fighter crossing into unfamiliar territory. But Jones vs. Ngannou is two MMA legends doing what they do best, in the same cage, under similar rules. There\u2019s no crossover novelty, and with Jones holding the UFC belt, there\u2019s no way Dana White would want to risk that prestige.\nJake Paul didn\u2019t escape the heat either.\n\u201cJake, stick to fighting washed up fighters. Don\u2019t talk about this stupid idea\n,\u201d\none user mocked. It\u2019s no secret that Jake Paul\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is stacked with aging MMA veterans and out-of-prime boxers. With his upcoming bout against\nJulio Cesar Chavez Jr.\non June 28th, critics see more of the same. But here\u2019s the thing: Jake Paul, the fighter, and Jake Paul, the promoter, are two very different beasts. Whether it\u2019s championing women\u2019s boxing with an all-female card or turning influencer fights into sellout shows, \u2018The Problem Child\u2019 has proven that he knows how to drive headlines and ticket sales.\nStill, skepticism lingers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously different,\u201d\nanother user argued. Pointing at Jake Paul the user wrote,\n\u201cYou and Donn look desperate to try anything to save PFL. Not a good look. Mayweather isn\u2019t in the MMA business. The UFC is.\u201d\nTranslation? This isn\u2019t about spectacle, this is about survival. While Mayweather\u2019s team had no stake in MMA, the UFC does, and Dana White won\u2019t easily hand over his crown jewel division to help prop up a rival. So while the fighters and fans might be onboard, the only question that really matters now is: will Dana White ever budge? What do you think? And if Francis Ngannou vs. Jon Jones really materializes, who do you think wins?\nThe post\n\u201cDesperate\u201d Jake Paul Left Embarrassed Over Jones vs. Ngannou PFL Offer by Dana White\u2019s Support\nappeared first on\nEssentiallySports\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Ngannou-Jones superfight possibility|UFC comeback buzz for Ngannou|PFL and UFC potential collaboration|Mayweather-McGregor crossover comparison|Winner-take-all profit split offer|Dana White's potential reluctance|Novelty of crossover fights vs. MMA legends|Jake Paul's promotional influence|PFL's need for a major event;E:Nicksick reigniting UFC comeback talk|Ngannou's exit from UFC|Jon Jones' move to heavyweight|Dana White's admission about Jones-Ngannou fight|Jake Paul teasing cross-promotional event|PFL's desire for the Ngannou-Jones fight|Jon Jones expressing interest in the fight|Ngannou responding to Jones' interest|PFL founder Davis's offer|User reactions to Jake Paul's proposal;D:Time passed since Ngannou's UFC exit|Heavyweight chaos in UFC|Mayweather-McGregor fight earned McGregor $130 million|PFL tickets priced at $25|Jake Paul's upcoming bout against Chavez Jr.|June 7, 2025 date of Jake Paul's X post|PFL|Cameroon|United States|Eric Nicksick|Home of Fight|Tom Aspinall|Jon Jones|Jonathan Dwight|Dana White|Jake Paul|Floyd Mayweather|Conor McGregor|Donn Davis|Tyson Fury|Anthony Joshua|Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.;", "er_digest": "N:PFL|Francis Ngannou|Anthony Joshua|Conor McGregor|Tyson Fury|Jake Paul|Jon Jones|Eric Nicksick|Dana White|UFC|Floyd Mayweather|Home of Fight|Donn Davis|Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.|Jonathan Dwight|Tom Aspinall;R:Cameroon;", "gist": "P:Ngannou-Jones superfight possibility|UFC comeback buzz for Ngannou|PFL and UFC potential collaboration|Mayweather-McGregor crossover comparison|Winner-take-all profit split offer|Dana White's potential reluctance|Novelty of crossover fights vs. MMA legends|Jake Paul's promotional influence|PFL's need for a major event;E:Nicksick reigniting UFC comeback talk|Ngannou's exit from UFC|Jon Jones' move to heavyweight|Dana White's admission about Jones-Ngannou fight|Jake Paul teasing cross-promotional event|PFL's desire for the Ngannou-Jones fight|Jon Jones expressing interest in the fight|Ngannou responding to Jones' interest|PFL founder Davis's offer|User reactions to Jake Paul's proposal;D:Time passed since Ngannou's UFC exit|Heavyweight chaos in UFC|Mayweather-McGregor fight earned McGregor $130 million|PFL tickets priced at $25|Jake Paul's upcoming bout against Chavez Jr.|June 7, 2025 date of Jake Paul's X post|PFL|Cameroon|United States|Eric Nicksick|Home of Fight|Tom Aspinall|Jon Jones|Jonathan Dwight|Dana White|Jake Paul|Floyd Mayweather|Conor McGregor|Donn Davis|Tyson Fury|Anthony Joshua|Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.;N:PFL|Francis Ngannou|Anthony Joshua|Conor McGregor|Tyson Fury|Jake Paul|Jon Jones|Eric Nicksick|Dana White|UFC|Floyd Mayweather|Home of Fight|Donn Davis|Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.|Jonathan Dwight|Tom Aspinall;R:Cameroon;", "entities": ["PFL", "Francis Ngannou", "Anthony Joshua", "Conor McGregor", "Tyson Fury", "Jake Paul", "Jon Jones", "Eric Nicksick", "Dana White", "UFC", "Floyd Mayweather", "Home of Fight", "Donn Davis", "Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.", "Jonathan Dwight", "Tom Aspinall"], "regions": ["Cameroon"]}, {"_id": "https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=65445", "content": "Skip to sub-navigation\nThis page has no sub-navigation.\nSkip to page content\n.\nToday in Energy\nMore Today in Energy\nPosted June 9, 2025\nIn 2024, the United States produced more energy than ever before \u203a\nData source:\nU.S. Energy Information Administration,\nMonthly Energy Review\nData values:\nPrimary Energy Production by Source\nIn 2024, the United States produced a record amount of energy, according to data in our\nMonthly Energy Review\n.

ex-Hamas leader, from a tunnel located beneath the European Hospital in southern Gaza.\nSinwar\u2019s\ndeath\nmarked another major blow to Hamas\u2019s leadership, although the terrorist group still maintains control over Gaza. The former Leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip was killed in an Israeli airstrike on May 13 targeting what the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\ndescribed\nas a Hamas \u201ccommand-and-control center\u201d beneath the hospital in Khan Younis, CNN reported.\nThe strike occurred just one day after Hamas released Israeli-American soldier Edan Alexander, who was held hostage. While the IDF believed at the time that Sinwar may have been killed in the attack, it took more than two weeks of investigation and identification before confirming his death, according to CNN.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu\nofficially acknowledged Sinwar\u2019s death during a speech to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, marking 600 days since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 surprise\nattack\nof Israel, which began the Gaza War. In his address, Netanyahu pointed to the impact of Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign in Gaza, claiming that \u201cthe military had eliminated tens of thousands of Hamas fighters and top leaders,\u201d including Mohammad Deif, Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar Mohammned brother and now Mohammed Sinwar.\nThe Israeli Prime Minister framed these actions as part of a broader effort to reshape the security landscape of the Middle East. However, the strike that killed Sinwar also caused significant civilian casualties.\nAccording to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, \u201cthe airstrikes that occurred on May 13 resulted in the death of 28 Palestinian civilians, and injured more than 50 other Palestinian\u201d civilians as well, CNN reported.\nThe location of the Hamas command center beneath a hospital has further fueled controversy, raising concerns about the use of civilian infrastructure in the conflict and the resulting humanitarian toll. Though Israel views the assassination of top Hamas leaders as a strategic success, it remains unclear whether these operations have weakened the group\u2019s overall control in Gaza.\nThe war continues to raise complex questions about military strategy, civilian safety, and the long-term prospects for peace in the region.\nMohammed Ibrahim hassan al-Sinwar was a Palestinian Politician and a radical who rose to power and became the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and of the wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.

However, daily mechanical scratches compromise their functionality, underscoring urgent need for self-healing E-Skins resistant to mechanical damage. Current materials have slow recovery times, impeding reliable signal measurement. The inability to heal within 1 minute is a major barrier to commercialization. A composition achieving 80% recovery within 1 minute has not yet been reported. Here, we present a rapidly self-healing E-Skin tailored for real-time monitoring of physical and physiological bioinformation. The E-Skin recovers more than 80% of its functionality within 10 seconds after physical damage, without the need of external stimuli. It consistently maintains reliable biometric assessment, even in extreme environments such as underwater or at various temperatures. Demonstrating its potential for efficient health assessment, the E-Skin achieves an accuracy exceeding 95%, excelling in wearable muscle strength analytics and on-site AI-driven fatigue identification. This study accelerates the advancement of E-Skin through rapid self-healing capabilities.\nINTRODUCTION\nElectronic skins (E-Skins) represent a transformative technology that integrates seamlessly with the paradigms of telehealth, personalized health care, and precision medicine (\n1\n,\n2\n). E-Skins facilitate the active and continuous monitoring of physical, physiological, and chemical biosignatures related to fatigue while maintaining comfort and minimizing disruption to daily activities, thus significantly enhancing the capacity for self-monitoring and substantially promoting the overall quality of health care delivery (\n3\n\u2013\n5\n). Specifically, real-time wearable electrophysiological devices are widely used to monitor muscle conditions in a noninvasive manner (\n6\n,\n7\n). This enables the assessment of muscle fatigue and the evaluation of postoperative muscle rehabilitation as well as the facilitation of proactive and personalized interventions tailored to individual physiological responses, thus ensuring both safety and performance.\nThe field has advanced over the past 20 years, yet persistent challenges remain unresolved. Critical issues, whether related to materials or devices, continue to hinder progress. Unexpected mechanical damage caused by repeated wear and tear and accidental cutting or scratching is the leading cause of device failure when undertaking labor-intensive and repetitive tasks, both indoors and outdoors. So far, achieving the requisite performance within 1 min after mechanical damage has proven difficult, posing a notable material challenge that remains unmet. Consequently, the 1-min performance threshold necessary for commercialization has not been attained. In addition, there is also the hurdle for E-skin technology to be effectively integrated into daily life.\nHere, we report an E-Skin capable of rapidly self-repairing after unexpected internal or external mechanical damage, recovering critical functions with a high recovery rate of 80% within 10 s and remaining operable. The rapidly self-healing E-Skin is designed to offer noninvasive electrophysiological monitoring and machine learning\u2013assisted fatigue evaluation during daily routines. Because of its high mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency, the E-Skin can also accurately track diverse human motions without requiring an external energy supply. To effectively simulate and evaluate the practical application potential of the E-Skin under realistic conditions, experimental parameters were selected to encompass a broad spectrum of environments. These parameters were deliberately chosen to mirror real-world usage scenarios, such as extreme temperatures and varying humidity levels, ensuring that the self-healing capabilities remain reliable across diverse operational conditions. Moreover, we develop an on-site AI-driven analytical tool capable of identifying and classifying muscle fatigue with more than 95% accuracy. In addition, the system features a personalized graphical user interface, enabling comprehensive real-time biometric interpretation.\nRESULTS\nStructural design, self-healing capability, and flexibility of the E-Skin\nAs illustrated conceptually in\nFig. 1A\n, the E-Skin provides wearable electrophysiological monitoring, including surface electromyography (sEMG), electrocardiography (ECG), and self-powered motion tracking. This E-Skin adheres seamlessly and conformably to the epidermis, enabling real-time results display on mobile devices (\nFig. 1B\n). The primary material used is fibrous thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), chosen for its softness, excellent breathability (water/air permeability), and self-protective abilities against adverse loading events (\n8\n\u2013\n10\n). Specifically, TPU is composed of both soft and hard segments, with the soft segments providing flexibility and the hard segments contributing mechanical strength. Its thermoplastic nature enables high chain mobility at elevated temperatures, facilitating bond reformation and supporting efficient self-healing. In addition, TPU\u2019s robust hydrogen bonds facilitate the rapid reconnection of damaged areas without requiring external stimuli, making it an ideal material for balancing durability and flexibility while promoting fast self-repair. Its excellent biocompatibility further ensures safety for extended skin contact (\n11\n\u2013\n13\n). Polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG) soft segments were further incorporated to enhance its softness, achieving a tissue-like consistency with a Young\u2019s modulus of approximately 0.1 MPa (\n14\n,\n15\n). The self-healing capability is essential to ensure that the E-Skin retains its functionality despite continuous mechanical stress from actions such as flipping, folding, and stretching, as well as potential user mishandling, such as accidental cuts or scratches during labor-intensive and repetitive tasks. To accomplish this, we used TPU as the backbone for the E-Skin and incorporated\nbis\n(4-hydroxyphenyl)disulfide into the matrix to promote the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds (fig. S1) (\n16\n,\n17\n). We incorporated isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) into the TPU matrix. The asymmetric alicyclic structure of IPDI significantly enhances the flexibility and mobility of the polymer chains, which is essential for effective self-healing. IPDI facilitates the disulfide metathesis reaction within the TPU matrix, enabling the reversible breaking and reformation of disulfide bonds autonomously. The biocompatibility of the IPDI-based TPU is clarified in note S1 (\n18\n,\n19\n). This reversible bonding mechanism is fundamental to the self-healing process, allowing it to occur without requiring heat or other external stimuli (\nFig. 1C\nand note S2). These disulfide (R\u2500S\u2500S\u2500R\u2032) bonds readily form through redox reactions between thiol (\u2212SH) groups in cysteine amino acids, even under ambient conditions, due to their very low redox potentials (\nFig. 1D\nand fig. S2) (\n20\n,\n21\n). A detailed summary of the material optimization process is provided in note S3 and figs. S3 and S4.\nThe silver nanowire (AgNW) conductive patterns were printed onto the substrate to ensure sufficient conductivity (\n22\n,\n23\n). The justification for using AgNWs as the electrode material in this study is detailed in note S4 and table S1 [(\n24\n\u2013\n27\n)] and fig. S5. As shown in\nFig. 1E\nand movies S1, the E-Skin demonstrated its ability to fully restore mechanical and electrical properties after complete severance, evidenced by a standalone light-emitting diode (LED) that resumed illumination within seconds. This rapid recovery of electrical conduction pathways after mechanical damage is attributed to the dynamic reconfiguration of nanostructured conductive networks. These networks comprise a one-dimensional (1D) AgNW network interfaced with a cross-linked, self-healing polymer matrix. The excellent durability and mechanical flexibility of the E-Skin allowed it to adapt to various dynamic deformation conditions (i.e., bending, stretching, crumpling, twisting, rolling, and folding) that can occur during device handling, cleaning, storage, and fitting without mechanical failure (\nFig. 1F\n). Also, the patch thickness could be further decreased via tuning the parameters (i.e., speed and duration) of the spin coating (fig. S6). To further evaluate the durability of the E-Skin under repeated mechanical deformation, a bending test was performed with a radius of 5 cm for up to 50,000 cycles (fig. S7). Only a 10% increase in resistance was observed, suggesting its structural and functional integrity when subjected to repeated mechanical stress.\nMechanical performance, stretchability, and self-healing properties of the E-Skin\nTo characterize the mechanical capabilities of the E-Skin, we plotted the stress-strain curve (\nFig. 2A\n) and calculated the Young\u2019s modulus (\nFig. 2B\n) after complete severance. As shown in\nFig. 2C\n, the healed E-Skin demonstrated great elasticity, sustaining up to 900% stretchability. The Young\u2019s modulus exhibited superior mechanical properties 1 hour post\u2013self-healing compared to its original state. This enhancement is likely due to the increased formation of disulfide bonds, which bolster the structural integrity of the E-Skin patch. During the healing process, microstructured changes occur, such as the densification and alignment of polymer chains, leading to improved mechanical properties. These changes contribute to the observed increase in Young\u2019s modulus by enhancing the elasticity and strength of the E-Skin. Atomic force microscopy validated the successful healing process (\nFig. 2D\n). Moreover, the healed E-Skin preserved its structural integrity while supporting a load of 1 kg, which is 1500 times its own weight, without any signs of failure (\nFig. 2E\n). Post-healing functionality was verified by attaching the E-Skin to the body, where it effectively continued to detect force through the triboelectric effect (\nFig. 2F\nand movie S2). The self-healing ability can be defined as\nSelf healing ability\n=\nYoung\n\u2019\ns\nmodulus\n(\nhealed\nE\n\u2013\nSkin\n)\nYoung\n\u2019\ns\nmodulus\n(\npristine\nE\n\u2013\nSkin\n)\nYoung\u2019s modulus was ascertained by examining the slope of the stress-strain curve, as shown in\nFig. 2A\n. (\n28\n) The self-healing capacity of the E-Skin was restored to approximately 80% within just 10 s (\nFig. 2H\n). Movie S3 demonstrates the dynamic self-healing process of the E-Skin under ambient conditions after being completely cut using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a widely used E-Skin material, as a comparative benchmark.\nAs mentioned above, incorporating IPDI with an asymmetric alicyclic structure into the TPU matrix enhances chain mobility, thereby promoting disulfide metathesis for self-healing while preserving mechanical robustness (\n29\n,\n30\n). The asymmetric structure of IPDI ensures sufficient chain mobility, facilitating self-healing even at low temperatures. These bonds can be activated at room temperature without the need for additional heat or external stimuli and are also responsive at intermediate temperatures (60\u00b0\u201390\u00b0C), enabling efficient self-healing across a wide range of temperatures, from low and high. Figure S8 presents the temperature-dependent kinetics of the self-healing process of the E-Skin. Elevated temperatures significantly accelerate this process by enhancing interactions among the polymer chains within the E-Skin. Specifically, the complete healing time decreased to about 7 min at 40\u00b0C, a temperature comparable to the skin surface during outdoor operations. In addition, fig. S9 evaluates the long-term durability and repeatability of the E-Skin through repetitive damaging (cutting)\u2013healing cycles at various temperatures (30 cycles at 25\u00b0C, 50 cycles at 40\u00b0C, and 100 cycles at 60\u00b0C).\nThe findings demonstrate minimal variation in the self-healing ability of the E-Skin even after extended use. Movie S4 showcases the E-Skin\u2019s practical application potential across various temperatures (\u22123\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 36\u00b0, and 50\u00b0C) and underwater, underscoring its waterproof properties due to the protective PDMS layer. This waterproof capability was further corroborated by pressure-sensing performance tests under different humidity conditions (40, 60, and 80%), as depicted in fig. S10. We assessed the self-healing performance under varying humidity levels of 40, 60, and 80%, representing a range of indoor and outdoor environmental conditions, ranging from relatively dry to highly humid settings (fig. S11). A comprehensive explanation of the criteria used to establish these aforementioned experimental conditions for evaluating self-healing performance is provided in note S5.\nWe further evaluated the changes in the physical and electrical properties of the E-Skin following repeated self-healing cycles. As shown in fig. S12, the E-Skin was subjected to up to 40 cycles of cutting and self-healing at 10-s intervals, with continuous monitoring of its electrical output during touch tests. The results indicate the reliability of the rapid self-healing capability of the E-Skin. In addition, we conducted up to 50 self-healing tests, measuring conductivity after each cycle (fig. S13). The results indicate negligible degradation, highlighting the E-Skin\u2019s superior durability, even after multiple cycles of cutting and self-healing.\nFigure 2I\nhighlights the self-healing ability of the E-Skin over time, while\nFig. 2J\nillustrates the correlation between self-healing ability and temperature. A comprehensive comparison has also been summarized in table S2. Moreover, the presence of sweat does not influence the self-healing capabilities, as consistent electrical output is maintained from the self-healed E-Skin patch on sweating skin, comparable to that of the pristine E-Skin patch (fig. S14).\nWhole-body monitoring of physiological signals and joint movements\nExcessive work-related physiological demands can adversely affect safety and productivity by diminishing workers\u2019 well-being, attentiveness, motivation, and manual labor capacity (\n31\n). Thus, it is imperative to assess their physiological conditions using comfortable, nonintrusive monitoring tools designed for everyday use, which are essential for any ergonomics study.\nOwning to its exceptional pressure sensitivity and conformal capability, our E-Skin enables real-time, noninvasive, and self-powered monitoring of various physiological signals. The triboelectric effect offers a robust strategy for powering E-Skin applications (\n32\n\u2013\n34\n). Detailed information of the self-healing mechanism can be found in note S6 and fig. S15. For accurate monitoring of subtle signals, it is essential for the E-Skin to establish conformal and intimate contact with the epidermis. This was achieved by securely attaching the E-Skin to the epidermis using biocompatible medical adhesive (\nFig. 3\n). In addition, the application of medical adhesive has a minimal impact on the self-healing performance (fig. S16). Facial expressions\u2014including ocular blinking, frowning, and smiling\u2014are primary channels for conveying human emotions and external communication. The E-Skin can capture minute muscle movements from microexpressions through variations in voltage signals. Specifically, subtle voltage signals induced by blinking were detected when the E-Skin was mounted on an eyelid (\nFig. 3A\n). In addition, the E-Skin can differentiate between normal and rapid blinking based on variations in frequency and amplitude.\nTo achieve accurate monitoring, it is essential for the E-Skin to maintain conformal and intimate contact with the epidermis. This was accomplished by securely attaching the E-Skin to the skin using biocompatible medical bandages (\nFig. 3\n). Facial expressions such as blinking, frowning, and smiling are fundamental for conveying human emotions and serve as primary external communication channels. The minute muscle movements associated with microexpressions can be effectively captured through variations in voltage signals. Specifically, subtle voltage changes induced by blinking were detected by affixing the E-Skin to an eyelid (\nFig. 3A\n). Furthermore, distinctions in the frequency and amplitude of regular versus rapid blinking were also discernible.\nAttaching the E-Skin to the forehead allowed for monitoring consistent and reproducible voltage signals during alternating regular and frowning movements (\nFig. 3B\n). Respiration, detectable through the flow of breath or the expansion and contraction of the chest and abdomen during inhalation and exhalation, is a vital sign for assessing users\u2019 health. When positioned on the vent of a conventional mask, the E-Skin successfully identified voltage signal changes associated with repeated oral breathing (\nFig. 3C\n).\nUpon conformal attachment to the throat, the E-Skin effectively recognized distinct words and phrases such as \u201cenergy,\u201d \u201cenergy harvesting\u201d, \u201ctribo,\u201d and \u201ctriboelectric\u201d. This demonstrates the voice recognition capabilities (\nFig. 3D\nand fig. S17). Each word was recorded three times, consistently generating similar voltage signal responses, indicating high repeatability for voice recognition. This feature could be instrumental in rehabilitating the speech abilities of users with damaged vocal cords by training them to control their throat muscle movements through remote human-machine interaction and control. In addition, the E-Skin demonstrates a robust response to subtle skin-level stimuli and can accurately track small joint movements, including the knuckle, elbow, knee, and ankle. For instance, when attached to the lateral knuckle of the index finger, the E-Skin recorded voltage responses during multiple bending-releasing cycles, with bending angles ranging from 30\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 (\nFig. 3E\n).\nThe E-Skin effectively detected motion angles across various joints, including the wrist (\nFig. 3F\n), elbow (\nFig. 3G\n), knee (\nFig. 3H\n), and ankle (\nFig. 3I\n). When applied to these joints and subjected to different degrees of bending and straightening, the E-Skin produced consistent and reproducible voltage signals corresponding to the joint angles, demonstrating its stability and reliability. Minor variations in the output frequencies of the voltage signals were observed, likely due to slight inconsistencies in movement patterns. The increased voltage output with larger bending angles is attributed to the expanded contact area between the E-Skin and the joints. The accurate recognition of joint motion angles facilitated by the E-Skin holds significant potential for real-time remote operation of robotic movements, thereby enhancing human-machine interaction capabilities.\nThe human movement state is a critical indicator of work intensity, which can be effectively monitored by placing the E-Skin on the ankle.\nFigure 3 (J and K)\nshows that attaching the E-Skin to either the back or front of the foot results in notable variations in the amplitude and frequency of the voltage signals, enabling the differentiation between walking and running. These examples illustrate that diverse physiological characteristics and movements can be translated into readable, quantifiable, real-time voltage signals via the E-Skin, thus offering a promising approach for comprehensive electrophysiological and motion monitoring. Therefore, the E-Skin shows great promise for applications in patient rehabilitation, worker performance monitoring, and as a human-machine interface for controlling robots to operate hazardous tasks. Movie S5 (2\u00d7 speed) records physiological signals and joint movements.\nComprehensive assessment of wearable electrophysiology under various conditions\nWearable electrophysiological monitoring, particularly sEMG and ECG, is crucial for identifying potential safety risks and health issues in real-life scenarios, such as heart attacks or muscular injuries (\n35\n,\n36\n). For stable and reliable signal acquisition, the E-Skin was conformally attached to the epidermis (\nFig. 4A\n). The E-Skin was placed on the forearm, and sEMG signals were recorded during muscle clenching and relaxing using a local field potential amplifier equipped with integrated high-pass and low-pass filters (\nFig. 4B\nand movie S6). To improve signal quality and minimize noise, we used band-pass filters designed for the specific frequency ranges of the measurements: 10 to 500 Hz for EMG and 0.3 to 40 Hz for ECG. For enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we used a three-electrode configuration instead of a two-electrode system, incorporating a third electrode connected to a drive-right-leg circuit to reduce power line noise. The collected data were then imported into MATLAB for further processing, where we applied a digital Butterworth filter and a notch filter with a sharper slope to effectively clean the data. A more detailed clarification of the numerical computation methods used for data processing and analysis is provided in note S7.\nFurthermore, the developed E-Skin exhibited rapid stability in sEMG recording within 10 s post-healing under ambient conditions, achieving performance comparable to existing technologies (fig. S18). The sEMG signal processing workflow is detailed in fig. S19. When applied to the forearm and synchronized with a hand dynamometer, the E-Skin detected an increase in EMG signal intensity corresponding to increased grasping force (\nFig. 4C\n). The E-Skin maintained its functionality underwater, effectively tracking muscle activity as its conductive and adhesive properties remained intact during water immersion (\nFig. 4D\n, fig. S20, and movie S7).\nConsistent with the sEMG measurements, ECG recordings were reliably achieved using the E-Skin device paired with a cost-effective AD620 instrumentation amplifier (\nFig. 4E\n). The self-healing capability of the E-Skin quickly restored its functionality, yielding signal quality comparable to that of an intact E-Skin measured in static air conditions (fig. S21). To assess underwater ECG recording performance with the E-Skin, we tested three conditions: without arm motion (static), with arm motion (moving), and with water flow impacting the E-Skin (affected) (\nFig. 4F\n, figs. S22 and S23, and movie S8). Given that most underwater environments involve dynamic water flow, the affected condition offers a more accurate representation of real-life applications. The recorded data were analyzed for quality and stability to enable a comprehensive comparison. The ECG signals were characterized by their key components: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave (fig. S24) (\n37\n). The R wave appears during ventricular contraction, representing the heart\u2019s pumping function, while the T wave (around a third of the size of the R wave) indicates the relaxing and blood-filling phase of the ventricles (\n38\n). Labor-intensive tasks increase ventricular relaxation, enlarging the T wave. As shown in\nFig. 4G\n, the T/R ratios recorded during movement and water impact were similar to those recorded under static conditions due to the tight contact of the E-skin with the epidermis. We expanded our experimental scope to encompass a broad range of dynamic and complex conditions, aiming to better simulate real-world scenarios and further validate the device\u2019s reliability and adaptability. As shown in fig. S25, ECG measurements were conducted under diverse aquatic conditions, including variations in water temperature (10\u00b0, 25\u00b0, and 40\u00b0C), depth (0, 30, and 60 cm), and type (sea water and tap water), as well as during dynamic movements such as swiveling, swaying, and flapping. These results demonstrate the device\u2019s capability to maintain stable ECG measurements across varying underwater environments and during different dynamic motions.\nTo elucidate the potential variations in ECG signals across different age groups and health conditions, we conducted additional experiments to expand our dataset. Figure S26A presents EMG signals recorded from adolescents (ages 10 to 19), vicenarians (ages 20 to 29), and tricenarians (ages 30 to 39) following a high-intensity strength exercise (30 push-ups, along with grip strength measurements). The results indicate that younger individuals exhibit stronger EMG signals and faster muscle responses. Figure S26B demonstrates that younger participants tend to have higher heart rate variability and normal ECG waveforms. ECG signals recorded post a 100-m sprint show that participants across all age groups (adolescents, vicenarians, and tricenarians) experienced an increased heart rate following exercise. A detailed clarification of differences in ECG signals across different ages and health conditions is provided in note S8. Furthermore, we conducted on-skin tests to evaluate the long-term wearability of the E-Skin. For comparison, two patches (the E-skin and a commercial gel electrode) were applied to the forearms of an adult subject for 1 day. As shown in fig. S27, the E-skin caused no adverse skin reactions with daily use. In contrast, the commercial gel electrode resulted in noticeable skin erythema, likely due to its limited oxygen and moisture permeability.\nMachine learning\u2013empowered prediction and classification of muscle fatigue\nThe time-domain and frequency-domain features of sEMG signals are well-established indicators for assessing muscle strength and fatigue (\n39\n\u2013\n43\n). Key biometric parameters\u2014such as the average rectified value (ARV), root mean square (RMS), mean frequency (MEF), and median frequency (MDF)\u2014have been extensively used to quantify muscle fatigue. Time-domain metrics, including ARV and RMS, offer insights into muscle fatigue and are instrumental in estimating endurance time. Moreover, alternations in the frequency-domain patterns of sEMG are associated with reductions in muscle force from an unfatigued state (\n44\n,\n45\n). Our analysis of sEMG signals, as detailed in table S3, enabled us to quantify muscle fatigue and strength effectively.\nWe used a machine learning\u2013powered system to predict and classify muscle fatigue by analyzing time- and frequency-domain features of sEMG signals obtained from the E-Skin. The system integrates wireless electronics with embedded algorithms, offering advanced neurorecording capabilities and comprehensive sEMG pattern recognition. The electronic circuit of the E-Skin system is composed of a bluetooth low energy (BLE) system-on-chip (SoC) system that is responsible for acquiring data from the analog front-ends (AFEs) dedicated to sEMG signals. The BLE SoC enables wireless data communication to a graphic user interface, which houses a compressed AI model, and a specialized deep-learning inference framework optimized for real-time wearable applications (figs. S28 and S29). These embedded components facilitate real-time sEMG signal pattern recognition and accurate prediction of muscle fatigue levels.\nWe used this machine learning model to analyze sEMG signals for the assessment of muscle fatigue, with data gathered via the E-Skin.\nFigure 5\nprovides an overview of the methodology, detailing a series of analyses and model training processes. Raw sEMG signals were initially captured as subjects performed a standardized dumbbell exercise regimen. The study involved 21 subjects, with their characteristics detailed in table S4. The protocol consisted of a cyclic sequence where subjects lifted and held a dumbbell for 5 s, followed by a 5-s rest period. Additional details regarding the protocol are available in note S9 and table S5. This sequence was repeated to generate a robust dataset representing varying levels of muscle fatigue (\nFig. 5A\n).\nWe then extracted temporal- and frequency-domain features from the data presented in\nFig. 5A\n. The time-domain analysis focused on computing ARV and RMS to indicate signal magnitude and muscular activity. Concurrently, the frequency-domain analysis used MDF and MEF to characterize muscle fatigue over time (fig. S30). As muscle fatigue increased, initial increments in the RMS and ARV values were observed due to the recruitment of additional muscle fibers. However, as fatigue intensified, a reduction in muscle fiber capability led to decreased RMS values. Both MDF and MEF generally declined with increasing muscle fatigue, indicating a shift in the signal toward a lower frequency as fatigue progressed. As shown in\nFig. 5 (B and C)\n, ARV and RMS values increased, while MDF and MEF values decreased with an increase in fatigue induced by repeated lifting of a 5-kg dumbbell. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, the subjects continued the dumbbell lifting exercise for 2 min post-rest, during which sEMG signals were captured to monitor the onset and progression of muscle fatigue. This extensive dataset provided a suitable training dataset for the machine learning algorithm (\nFig. 5D\n).\nTo investigate the interplay between temporal evolution and spectral changes in muscle activity, we visualized the time-frequency distribution of the sEMG signal, providing insights into spectral patterns associated with sustained effort (\nFig. 5E\n). For this purpose, we developed a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify levels of muscle fatigue from the sEMG data (\nFig. 5F\n). The model\u2019s architecture includes an initial input layer, followed by a first 2D convolution layer with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation to enhance computational efficiency, and a second 2D convolution layer to further extract fatigue-related features, both using 8 \u00d7 10 filters. The output from the second convolution layer is passed through an additional ReLU activation layer, flattened, and fed into a fully connected layer for feature mapping, ultimately producing the final fatigue score via SoftMax activation.\nWe divided the precollected EMG data into three sets to train the model: 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The CNN model was trained while minimizing the cross-entropy loss function, with a dropout rate of 0.5 applied to mitigate overfitting. After 100,000 epochs, the CNN model achieved an accuracy exceeding 90% (\nFig. 5, G and H\n). Subsequently, the model parameter values were fixed, and quantization was applied, resulting in an 8-bit model with a reduced size of less than 20 kB, facilitating integration with the real-time graphic user interface (movie S9).\nWe assessed the classification performance of the CNN model using confusion matrices to quantitatively represent the model\u2019s predictions across three distinct classes: Fatigue, medium (Mid), and relax. As shown in\nFig. 5I\n, the matrix on the left depicts the performance using 32-bit floating-point precision, while the matrix on the right illustrates the performance after applying 8-bit integer quantization. In these confusion matrices, the diagonal elements indicate the proportion of correct predictions for each class, while the off-diagonal elements represent misclassifications.\nThe 32-bit model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying different states, achieving 96% for \u201cFatigue,\u201d 95% for \u201cMid,\u201d and 98% for \u201cRelax.\u201d Similarly, the quantized 8-bit model showed strong performance, with classification accuracies of 93% for Fatigue, 94% for Mid, and 96% for Relax. These results indicate that the model preserves high predictive accuracy following quantization. While quantization typically reduces the memory footprint and computational complexity of the model at the cost of some accuracy, our CNN model maintains high-performance post-quantization. This underscores its potential for real-time fatigue monitoring in wearable devices.\nDISCUSSION\nWe developed a rapid self-healing E-Skin patch for noninvasive real-time electrophysiological and joint-movement monitoring. The E-Skin was constructed from stretchable PTMEG-modified TPU and a soft silver nanowire network that enabled direct and intimate contact with the skin. This design ensured self-healing within 10 s, without the need of external stimuli, and under ambient conditions, effectively responding to mechanical damage resulting from the skin\u2019s dynamic movements, providing adaptability suitable for real daily life use. This was achieved by integrating bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) disulfide into the TPU matrix, which endowed the E-Skin with self-healing capabilities through the formation of intracellular disulfide bonds. IPDI, characterized by its an asymmetric alicyclic structure, was used to enhance chain mobility, thereby facilitating disulfide exchange. This modification further improved material\u2019s self-healing capabilities across a broad temperature range, including both high temperature and low temperatures. This significantly mitigated mechanical damage from repeated wear, tear, and accidental cuts or scratches, thereby preserving the device\u2019s structural integrity and functionality over prolonged use.\nIntegrating E-Skin with wireless electronics and embedded algorithms enabled the long-term monitoring of biophysical signals and facilitated on-site AI-powered analysis. This system provided real-time identification and classification of muscle fatigue. Leveraging a CNN algorithm to learn from sEMG signal patterns associated with fatigue, the system offers a robust tool to monitor the muscular status of the users and potentially supply an early warning of injury risk due to muscle fatigue. The seamless incorporation of AI and embedded algorithms further enhanced its utility in health evaluation and rehabilitative therapies.\nDespite the significant performance of the E-Skin device, future advancements focus on several key areas: First, enhancing electrode materials and mechanical structure is essential; while AgNW has shown effectiveness, alternative materials such as MXene, CNTs, and conductive polymers hold additional potential. Future research will prioritize exploring these materials individually and in combination to optimize device performance, aiming for improved stability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Second, extending the operational duration of the E-Skin is crucial to facilitate long-term electrophysiological monitoring in real-life scenarios, with a goal of enabling the device to function continuously for days or even weeks. Third, achieving full miniaturization of the E-Skin will require the development of integrated electronics capable of supporting electro-impedance spectroscopy, signal processing, and wireless transmission. By creating a standalone E-Skin sensing interface equipped with AI-assisted on-site signal processing, the device can be transformed into a comprehensive, skin-interfaced monitoring system. Last, conducting large-scale validation studies across diverse populations is essential, given the variability of physiological signals. These studies will ensure the E-Skin functions reliably for a wide range of users, paving the way for a fully integrated, intelligent platform that provides valuable insights into individual health and physiological status, contributing to injury prevention and management, particularly in labor-intensive occupations.\nWe envision this rapidly self-healing E-Skin patch offers substantial benefits to a diverse group of users\u2014including construction workers, athletes, and military personnel\u2014by enabling robust health monitoring in daily life and under extreme conditions. It aims to prevent and manage injuries related to labor-intensive activities, optimize training regimens, and support physical therapy by real-time tracking recovery progress. Ultimately, this E-Skin patch has the potential to enhance overall health and performance across various real-world scenarios.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaterials\nPTMEG with an average molecular weight of 1000 g mol\n\u22121\n, IPDI (98%, mixture of isomers), and dibutyltin dilaurate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethylacetamide was sourced from Samchun Chemical, and bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) disulfide was acquired from Ambeed. All reagents were used as received without further purification.\nSelf-healing polymer fabrication\nPTMEG (15 g) was dried at 100\u00b0C for 1 hour to remove residual moisture and then cooled to 70\u00b0C. Meanwhile, IPDI (10 g, 44.98 mmol) and dibutyltin dilaurate (0.2 g) were dissolved in 5 ml of\nN\n,\nN\n-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) under a nitrogen (N\n2\n) atmosphere for 2 hours and then cooled to room temperature. Bis(hydroxyphenyl) disulfide (3.63 g, 14.50 mmol), dissolved in 10 ml of DMAc, was introduced into the reactor as a chain extender. The reactor temperature was raised to 40\u00b0C, allowing the reaction to continue until the NCO peak was no longer detectable. The concentration of the resultant polymer solution was adjusted to 30 weight % by adding 43 ml of DMAc. The solution was then degassed under vacuum for approximately 1 hour to eliminate bubbles. Subsequently, 20 ml of the synthesized polymer solution was poured onto a Teflon-coated dish, cured on a hotplate at 40\u00b0C for 1 day, and then allowed to cure at room temperature.\nE-Skin fabrication\nThe E-Skin substrate was treated with utraviolet (UV)\u2013Ozone (UVC-30s, Jasung Engineering) to eliminate potential organic contaminants and introduce oxygen-containing functional groups, thereby enhancing its hydrophilic properties. Silver nanowire ink was prepared following our established methods (\n23\n,\n28\n). The silver nanowire electrodes were precisely patterned onto the self-healing E-Skin substrate using screen-printing techniques facilitated by laser-cut shadow masks. The printed E-Skin was then annealed to improve its stability at room temperature.\nOn-body validation of the E-Skin\nThe epidermal evaluation was conducted on healthy adult individuals without heart conditions, diabetes, or chronic pain, adhering strictly to the protocol sanctioned by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Los Angeles (IRB#17-000170). Further, informed written consent was obtained from all participants.\nECG measurement\nThe E-Skin was applied to the forearm for ECG measurements. Two E-Skin patches were positioned on the volunteer\u2019s left and right forearms secured with a commercially available medical adhesive (3M, USA) to ensure proper adhesion. ECG signals were acquired using a commercial ECG board (SparkFun AD8232 ECG monitor) and recorded with a digital phosphor oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO3014). The electronic circuit board was powered by a portable power source (Dr. Meter, PS-305DM) at approximately 3.3 V. The circuit board utilized an AD8232 chip to amplify and filter the raw ECG signals.\nElectrical integration for sEMG recording\nWe incorporated a BLE SoC (NRF52840-CKAA, Nordic Semiconductor) encased in a compact wafer-level chip-scale package (WLCSP) measuring 3.5 mm by 3.6 mm, serving as both the central processing unit and Bluetooth communication module to facilitate deep-learning operations. A rechargeable lithium-polymer battery, connected to a low-dropout linear voltage regulator (ADP7112, Analog Devices), provided a stable voltage output. For wireless data transmission, the BLE SoC used a miniature ceramic antenna (2450AT18A100, Johanson Technology) measuring 3.2 mm by 1.6 mm and operating at 2.45 GHz. The amplification, filtering, and digitization of sEMG signals were performed using ultralow-power biopotential AFEs (MAX30003, Maxim Integrated) in a WLCSP format measuring 2.74 mm by 2.9 mm. These AFEs exhibited exceptional performance, with an ultralow-power consumption of 180 \u03bcW and a high common-mode rejection ratio exceeding 100 dB. Digital sEMG data were transmitted to the BLE SoC via the serial peripheral interface. To ensure a stable 1.8-V supply for the biopotential AFE, a secondary low-dropout voltage regulator (LP5907UVX, Texas Instruments) in a four-pin WLCSP measuring 0.645 mm by 0.645 mm was connected to the output of the primary voltage regulator. The integration of passive components in 0201 packages, known for their compact size, helped minimize the system\u2019s overall physical footprint.\nCharacterizations and measurements\nThe transmittance spectra of PDMS and E-Skin were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer. The strain-stress response of the E-Skin during the healing process was analyzed with a JSH-H1000 Horizontal Acomatic Handy Test Stand and SOP-EG1 software. The applied force was quantified using a Mark-10 force monitor, and the corresponding output characteristics were captured with an MDO-3052 oscilloscope. This oscilloscope was also used to record output characteristics from various body locations. The healing process of the E-Skin following complete severance was assessed using AFM (NX10). For EMG and ECG measurements, a PZ5 neuro digitizer amplifier and RZ2 software were used.\nAcknowledgments\nThis project was partially inspired by the postdoctoral training Y. Zhu undertook in S.

He was 82.\nStone, born Sylvester Stewart, had been in poor health in recent years. His publicist Carleen Donovan said Monday that Stone died surrounded by family after contending with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other ailments.\nFormed in 1966-67, Sly and the Family Stone was the first major group to include Black and white men and women, and well embodied a time when anything seemed possible \u2014 riots and assassinations, communes and love-ins. The singers screeched, chanted, crooned and hollered. The music was a blowout of frantic horns, rapid-fire guitar and locomotive rhythms, a melting pot of jazz, psychedelic rock, doo-wop, soul and the early grooves of funk.\nAdvertisement:\nSly\u2019s time on top was brief, roughly from 1968-1971, but profound. No band better captured the gravity-defying euphoria of the Woodstock era or more bravely addressed the crash which followed. From early songs as rousing as their titles \u2014 \u201cI Want To Take You Higher,\u201d \u201cStand!\u201d \u2014 to the sober aftermath of \u201cFamily Affair\u201d and \u201cRunnin\u2019 Away,\u201d Sly and the Family Stone spoke for a generation whether or not it liked what they had to say.\nStone\u2019s group began as a Bay Area sextet featuring Sly on keyboards, Larry Graham on bass; Sly\u2019s brother, Freddie, on guitar; sister Rose on vocals; Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini horns and Greg Errico on drums. They debuted with the album \u201cA Whole New Thing\u201d and earned the title with their breakthrough single, \u201cDance to the Music.\u201d It hit the top 10 in April 1968, the week the Rev. Martin Luther King was murdered, and helped launch an era when the polish of Motown and the understatement of Stax suddenly seemed of another time.\nAdvertisement:\nLed by Sly Stone, with his leather jumpsuits and goggle shades, mile-wide grin and mile-high Afro, the band dazzled in 1969 at the Woodstock festival and set a new pace on the radio. \u201cEveryday People,\u201d \u201cI Wanna Take You Higher\u201d and other songs were anthems of community, non-conformity and a brash and hopeful spirit, built around such catchphrases as \u201cdifferent strokes for different folks.\u201d The group released five top 10 singles, three of them hitting No. 1, and three million-selling albums: \u201cStand!\u201d, \u201cThere\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On\u201d and \u201cGreatest Hits.\u201d\nFor a time, countless performers wanted to look and sound like Sly and the Family Stone. The Jackson Five\u2019s breakthrough hit, \u201cI Want You Back\u201d and the Temptations\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Next to You\u201d were among the many songs from the late 1960s that mimicked Sly\u2019s vocal and instrumental arrangements. Miles Davis\u2019 landmark blend of jazz, rock and funk, \u201cBitches Brew,\u201d was inspired in part by Sly, while fellow jazz artist Herbie Hancock even named a song after him.\n\u201cHe had a way of talking, moving from playful to earnest at will. He had a look, belts, and hats and jewelry,\u201d Questlove wrote in the foreword to Stone\u2019s memoir, \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\u201d named for one of his biggest hits and published through Questlove\u2019s imprint in 2023. \u201cHe was a special case, cooler than everything around him by a factor of infinity.\u201d\nAdvertisement:\nIn 2025, Questlove released the documentary \u201cSly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius).\u201d\nSly\u2019s influence has endured for decades. The top funk artist of the 1970s, Parliament-Funkadelic creator George Clinton, was a Stone disciple. Prince, Rick James and the Black-Eyed Peas were among the many performers from the 1980s and after influenced by Sly, and countless rap and hip-hop artists have sampled his riffs, from the Beastie Boys to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. A 2005 tribute record included Maroon 5, John Legend and the Roots.\n\u201cSly did so many things so well that he turned my head all the way around,\u201d Clinton once wrote. \u201cHe could create polished R&B that sounded like it came from an act that had gigged at clubs for years, and then in the next breath he could be as psychedelic as the heaviest rock band.\u201d\nSign up for the Today newsletter\nGet everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\nMost Popular\nKaren Read murder trial livestream video: Monday, June 9\nMass. selectman proposes CORI checks on drag artists, raising ire\nAs 'emergency' rally planned in Boston, local leaders respond to Trump's actions in LA\nBoston movie tour: Here\u2019s where your favorite Boston flicks were filmed\nLynnfield employees placed on leave for alleged racist language\nIn Related News\nRick Derringer, who had a hit with 'Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo,' dies at 77\nMusic\nWe were at Boston Calling 2025: Here's what we saw\nMusic\nCarl Dean, Dolly Parton's husband of nearly 60 years, dies at 82\nBoston.com Newsletter Signup\nBoston.com Logo\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

However, it all fell apart in 2022, when Brown requested a trade from the team, stating that\nJohn Harbaugh\n\u2018s offensive system \u201c\njust wasn\u2019t for me.\n\u201d Since then,\nBaltimore\nhas been struggling at the receiver position. But not anymore. It looks like Coach John Harbaugh\u2019s worries are finally about to come to an end with a sixth-round pick. Enter\nLaJohntay Wester.\nThis year, in the sixth round, GM\nEric DeCosta\nand the Ravens brass picked Colorado receiver LaJohntay Wester as their 203rd overall. While they might not have seen him as a potential starting receiver, the rookie is turning heads in the team\u2019s OTAs. As per reports, coach Harbaugh is giving Wester good practice time as a punt returner and a receiver.\nRecently, on the\nLocked On Ravens\npodcast, host Kevin Oestreicher and former Ravens WR\nQadry Ismail\nwere all praises for the young wideout. \u201c\nHe is just, his skill set is what I\u2019ve been dreaming of for the Ravens to get since they lost Marquise Brown.\n\u201d\nIsmail pointed out that even though the team has\nZay Flowers\n, he is not quite suited for playing deep-threat roles.\nRookie WR LaJohntay Wester continues to be an intriguing player for the Ravens\npic.twitter.com/YnhMIEt7zN\n\u2014 Locked On Ravens (@lockedonravens)\nJune 8, 2025\n\u201c\nWester has that skill set. I think he\u2019s going to be a monster for the Ravens this season. I think that he\u2019s going to be one of those rookies\n,\u201d added Qadry. Coming from Colorado, Wester was the second-best receiver on the Buffaloes team after this year\u2019s second overall pick,\nTravis Hunter\n. The 23-year-old racked up 931 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wester was picked up quite late despite having good numbers.\nAnd even now, he must be outstanding on special teams to get a regular chance on the\nRavens\n\u2018 offense.\nSo far, as Qadry Ismail has pointed out, LaJohntay Wester has looked good. \u201c\nI think one of the three that I saw was a contested catch. And he had good hand-eye coordination with it\n,\u201d Ismail said on the podcast.\nSo, with Wester showing promise in the team\u2019s OTAs, there is new hope. And the possibility that Baltimore\u2019s receiver troubles might finally be ending.\nMarquise Brown\u2019s post-Ravens era\nIf there was anybody on the Ravens squad who was going to be affected deeply by Marquise Brown\u2019s exit, it was QB\nLamar Jackson\n. Though Wester is good, Brown was not only Lamar\u2019s No. 1 receiver but also his best friend on the team. Initially, when John Harbaugh called the QB to inform him of the news, he did not believe it.\nTalking about his trade, the Ravens QB shared, \u201c\nIt was after a workout, and I was like, \u2018OK,\u2019 [and] I\u2019m just listening to him. But he was like, \u2018We\u2019re thinking about trading him\u2019 and stuff like that, but I didn\u2019t buy into it.\nI was kind of hurt, because that\u2019s my boy. But it\u2019s all good. Like I said, it\u2019s part of the business.\u201d\nMarquise started his NFL journey donning the Ravens jersey in 2019. After three seasons in Baltimore, the WR changed homes to the\nArizona Cardinals\n.\nWith the Cardinals, Brown could not quite find his stride. Although the WR reunited with his college QB\nKyler Murray\n, his debut season was cut short after he hurt his foot in Week 6. When asked about whether the wideout regretted getting traded from the Ravens, Marquise shared, \u201c\nI feel like my time in Arizona, I mean, I didn\u2019t accomplish what I wanted to on the field. But as a man, I grew. I grew closer to God, I grew closer in my relationship with my family.\n\u201d The Oklahoma alum\u2019s journey with the Cardinals ended after two seasons. Brown then signed a one-year deal with the\nChiefs\n, hoping for a fresh start.\nMarquise\u2019s season with Kansas City came to a halt even before it kicked off. The\n28-year-old suffered a sternoclavicular injury\nduring the preseason last year. Brown debuted in the Chiefs gear in December and played a couple of games last season. The WR also played in the Super Bowl game. In March, the Chiefs re-signed him on a one-year contract. So, Brown will once again be gearing up in the Chiefs jersey this season. Would he be able to bring his career back on track again? Guess we will have to wait.\nAnd for the Ravens\u2019 rookie, LaJohntay Wester, he might kick off his season on special teams. But if he performs well, Wester might finally step into Brown\u2019s shoes for Harbaugh\u2019s offense.\nThe post\nAfter 4 Years, John Harbaugh Finally Gets Key Replacement in Colorado Grad LaJohntay Wester\nappeared first on\nEssentiallySports\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Key replacement for Marquise Brown|Ending receiver troubles for Baltimore|Potential for LaJohntay Wester to be a \"monster\"|Hope for ending Baltimore's receiver troubles|Wester showing promise in OTAs;E:Trade request by Marquise Brown|LaJohntay Wester drafted by Ravens|Wester praised by Kevin Oestreicher and Qadry Ismail|Marquise Brown traded to Arizona Cardinals|Brown signed with Chiefs|Brown re-signed by Chiefs;D:6th round pick (203rd overall)|931 yards|10 touchdowns|23 years old|28 years old (Marquise Brown);", "er_digest": "N:Lamar Jackson|Kevin Oestreicher|Zay Flowers|Ravens|Eric DeCosta|John Harbaugh|Qadry Ismail|LaJohntay Wester|Travis Hunter|Kyler Murray|Marquise Brown|Arizona Cardinals|Chiefs;R:Kansas City|Baltimore|Colorado;", "gist": "P:Key replacement for Marquise Brown|Ending receiver troubles for Baltimore|Potential for LaJohntay Wester to be a \"monster\"|Hope for ending Baltimore's receiver troubles|Wester showing promise in OTAs;E:Trade request by Marquise Brown|LaJohntay Wester drafted by Ravens|Wester praised by Kevin Oestreicher and Qadry Ismail|Marquise Brown traded to Arizona Cardinals|Brown signed with Chiefs|Brown re-signed by Chiefs;D:6th round pick (203rd overall)|931 yards|10 touchdowns|23 years old|28 years old (Marquise Brown);N:Lamar Jackson|Kevin Oestreicher|Zay Flowers|Ravens|Eric DeCosta|John Harbaugh|Qadry Ismail|LaJohntay Wester|Travis Hunter|Kyler Murray|Marquise Brown|Arizona Cardinals|Chiefs;R:Kansas City|Baltimore|Colorado;", "entities": ["Lamar Jackson", "Kevin Oestreicher", "Zay Flowers", "Ravens", "Eric DeCosta", "John Harbaugh", "Qadry Ismail", "LaJohntay Wester", "Travis Hunter", "Kyler Murray", "Marquise Brown", "Arizona Cardinals", "Chiefs"], "regions": ["Kansas City", "Baltimore", "Colorado"]}, {"_id": "https://www.brownfieldagnews.com/news/illinois-crops-benefitting-from-rains/", "content": "News\nIllinois crops benefitting from rains\nJune 9, 2025\nBy\nJared White\nFiled Under:\n2025 Planting Season\n,\nCorn\n,\nCrops\n,\ncrops\n,\nCrops\n,\nIllinois\n,\nNews\n,\nSoybeans\n,\nSpecialty Crops\n,\nUSDA\n,\nWheat\nThe USDA says Illinois crops benefitted from recent rains.\nMason County farmer Matt Sandage says things look good in his area despite a slow start.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some hill ground that looks tough.\u201d\u00a0 He says, \u201cWe had some emergence problems and it\u2019s having a little bit of fight there, but as far as overall, it couldn\u2019t look any better right now.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little bit behind on age, but it\u2019s coming along quickly I believe.\u201d\nThe latest weekly crop progress and condition report shows as of Sunday 68% of Illinois corn is in good to excellent condition, up 5% on the week, with 97% planted and 89% emerged.\u00a0 Fifty-nine percent of soybeans are in good to excellent condition, steady with last week, with 91% planted and 81% emerged.\u00a0 Sandage tells Brownfield\u2026\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t worry about it a whole lot.

This offers the opportunity to earn Mosaic 4 status.\nIt\u2019s common for airlines to offer some sort of status challenge or status match program, in order to lure frequent flyers who are loyal to competing airlines, but are considering a switch. In the United States, most major airlines offer some sort of a status match challenge opportunity, including\nAlaska\n,\nAmerican\n,\nDelta\n,\nSouthwest\n, and\nUnited\n.\nJetBlue TrueBlue offers\nan ongoing status match challenge\nto earn\nMosaic elite status\n, and it\u2019s potentially pretty lucrative. In this post, I want to take a look at what you can expect from the program for 2025.\nJetBlue TrueBlue Match to Mosaic offer\nJetBlue TrueBlue has an status match called Match to Mosaic, whereby those with elite status on other eligible US airlines are able to receive Mosaic status. Qualifying members can receive complimentary Mosaic 1 or Mosaic 2 status for three months, with the opportunity to keep their current status, or even \u201clevel up\u201d to Mosaic 3.\nWhat status will JetBlue match?\nJetBlue TrueBlue will match status with Alaska Mileage Plan, American AAdvantage, Delta SkyMiles, Free Spirit, FrontierMiles, and Southwest Rapid Rewards. United MileagePlus status matches are no longer available, presumably due to\nthe new partnership between the airlines\n. Below you can see how status maps over between programs.\nPrograms JetBlue TrueBlue will match from\nAs you can see above, through June 30, 2025, there\u2019s a special promotion for American AAdvantage and Delta SkyMiles, allowing eligible members to earn Mosaic 4 status:\nIf you have American AAdvantage Concierge Key, Executive Platinum, or Platinum Pro, or Delta SkyMiles Delta 360, Diamond, or Platinum, you can apply for a status match to Mosaic 2\nOnce accepted, you\u2019ll have until December 31, 2025, to earn 50 tiles and unlock Mosaic 4\nIf you earn 50 tiles, you\u2019ll receive Mosaic 4 through December 31, 2026, and all of the Signature Perks, which include six Move to Mint certificates, the ability to gift Mosaic 1 status to a friend or family member through the end of 2026, all Mosaic 1-3 Signature Perks, and four Perks You Pick choices\nHow do you maintain JetBlue Mosaic status?\nOnce you\u2019re approved for a JetBlue TrueBlue Mosaic status match, your status is valid for three months. To maintain status through the end of the following year, you need to earn a certain number of tiles within that timeframe:\nFor Mosaic 1, you need to earn 10 tiles\nFor Mosaic 2, you need to earn 25 tiles\nFor Mosaic 3, you need to earn 40 tiles\nThese tiers ordinarily require 50, 100, or 150 tiles annually, so you essentially have 25% of the normal time period to earn anywhere from 20% to 27% of the regular number of tiles.\nAs a reminder, one tile is ordinarily awarded for every $100 in qualifying JetBlue purchases, or every $1,000 in eligible spending on\nJetBlue credit cards\n.\nIn other words, Mosaic 1 would require $1,000 in spending on JetBlue or $10,000 in spending on a JetBlue credit card, while Mosaic 3 would require $4,000 in spending on JetBlue or $40,000 in spending on a JetBlue credit card.\nLet me emphasize that while the status you have in another program determines whether you get Mosaic 1 or Mosaic 2 for a period of three months, anyone who participates in the challenge can unlock Mosaic 1, Mosaic 2, or Mosaic 3, through the end of the following year.\nThis means that if you start a Mosaic 2 challenge but only earn 10 tiles, you\u2019d receive Mosaic 1 through the end of the following year. Meanwhile if you start a Mosaic 1 challenge and earn 40 tiles, you\u2019d receive Mosaic 3 through the end of the following year.\nUnlock JetBlue Mosaic elite status easily\nHow do you request a JetBlue status match?\nYou can request a JetBlue TrueBlue status challenge directly\non this webpage\n. You\u2019ll need to provide a screenshot of your frequent flyer program profile showing your full name and proof of status. If you\u2019re matching to Mosaic 2, you\u2019ll also need to provide a screenshot or photo of your most recent boarding pass or flight confirmation email showing your status.\nJetBlue states that this offer is only valid for elite members who have qualified for status via flight or credit card activity. Matched, transferred, or promotional elite status, is not eligible for a JetBlue Mosaic status match. It\u2019s also only valid for US residents, and one status match is allowed at most every 24 months.\nNote that it can take up to four weeks for a status match to be processed, so that\u2019s quite a long lead time. As a result, you might want to request a status match well ahead of when you think you can complete the qualifying activity. Of course it\u2019s also possible that a match is processed much faster than that.\nAlso be aware that if a challenge is successfully completed, extended Mosaic status will not be issued immediately. Instead, it\u2019ll be granted three to seven days after the conclusion of the three month challenge period.\nRequesting a JetBlue status match is easy\nWhat benefits of JetBlue Mosaic status do you receive?\nI\u2019ve written a\nguide to JetBlue Mosaic elite status\nin the past, so I won\u2019t go into great detail here. Instead I wanted to focus on how Signature Perks, plus the Perks You Pick program, play into this. How exactly does that work in the context of this status match?\nDuring the three month Match to Mosaic trial, participants will receive all Signature Perks associated with their matched Mosaic status, which includes the following (note some perks\naren\u2019t available on Blue Basic fares\n):\nFirst two checked bags free\nFree inflight beer, wine, and liquor\nSame day flight changes\nMosaic priority boarding\nPriority security\nEven More Space seats at check-in (for Mosaic 2, you get Even More Space at the time of booking)\nPreferred Core seating\nDedicated check-in area\nDedicated phone support line and priority chat assistance\nJetBlue TrueBlue Mosaic 1 Signature Perks\nOn top of that, they\u2019ll receive a pre-selected Perks You Pick benefit:\nFor Mosaic 1, you\u2019ll receive Mint Suite priority, offering priority access to Mint Suite selection on select aircraft (on classic A321s, the Mint Suites in row two are reserved for Mosaic members up to 14 days before departure)\nFor Mosaic 2, you\u2019ll receive a pet fee waiver, whereby you can jet with your cat or small dog on all eligible JetBlue flights at no extra charge, a $125 value per flight\nParticipants who complete the tile challenge will then have the opportunity to select their own Perks You Pick benefits after earning status through the following year. So for example, at this point you could receive JetBlue Mint upgrade vouchers.\nGet Even More Space seating with JetBlue Mosaic\nIs a JetBlue status match worth it?\nI\u2019m happy to see JetBlue TrueBlue offering an elite status match promotion, since this is new as of August 2024. This has been long overdue, though I\u2019m not surprised to see it, given that JetBlue is trying to increase revenue from its loyalty program. This is especially valuable when you consider JetBlue\u2019s lack of airline partners, meaning there aren\u2019t many ways to get elite benefits on the airline.\nObviously if you fly JetBlue pretty frequently and have status with a competing program, this is a no-brainer. Of particular note is that this offer can be taken advantage of once every 24 months, at least based on current terms, so it\u2019s not a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nFor example, if you were to start a status match challenge now and successfully complete it, status would be valid through the end of 2026. Presumably you could then once again match at some point in 2027. That\u2019s pretty awesome.\nIf you do take advantage of this opportunity, there\u2019s merit to going for JetBlue Mosaic 3, which can be unlocked with $4,000 of JetBlue spending, or $40,000 in spending on a JetBlue credit card. In addition to all the consistent JetBlue Mosaic perks, you\u2019d also receive four JetBlue Mint upgrade vouchers.\nJetBlue flights require anywhere from one to four upgrade vouchers per segment, depending on the route and particular flight, so there\u2019s significant value to be had, as this is one of the\nbest ways to score a JetBlue Mint seat\n.\nScore JetBlue Mint upgrades with Mosaic 3\nBottom line\nJetBlue TrueBlue has a Match to Mosaic program. With this, you can receive Mosaic 1 or Mosaic 2 status for a period of three months, and can then receive Mosaic 1, Mosaic 2, or Mosaic 3, through the end of the following year, based on how much activity you complete. This offer is available to elite members of six different US frequent flyer programs.\nI\u2019m happy to see JetBlue offering a consistent status match, and I\u2019m sure this will be popular with many. I\u2019m considering this offer, though with JetBlue\nhaving discontinued Mint flights to Miami\n, perhaps this is less tempting for now\u2026\nWhat do you make of JetBlue\u2019s Match to Mosaic offer?", "ped_digest": "P:JetBlue TrueBlue Match to Mosaic program offers elite status matches|Limited time offer for American AAdvantage and Delta SkyMiles elite members valid through June 30, 2025|Allows earning Mosaic 4 status|Airlines offer status match challenges to lure frequent flyers|JetBlue TrueBlue Match to Mosaic provides Mosaic 1 or 2 status for three months|Opportunity to maintain or \"level up\" to Mosaic 3|Requires earning tiles to maintain status|Mosaic 1 requires 10 tiles|Mosaic 2 requires 25 tiles|Mosaic 3 requires 40 tiles|One tile earned per $100 in JetBlue purchases or $1,000 on JetBlue credit cards|Earning 50 tiles unlocks Mosaic 4 through December 31, 2026|Mosaic 4 includes Signature Perks and four Perks You Pick choices|Status match requests take up to four weeks to process|Extended Mosaic status granted 3-7 days after challenge period|Eligible members receive Signature Perks during the three-month trial|Benefits include free checked bags, inflight drinks, same-day flight changes, priority boarding, and preferred seating|Mosaic 1 receives Mint Suite priority|Mosaic 2 receives a pet fee waiver|JetBlue is trying to increase revenue from its loyalty program|Offer available once every 24 months|JetBlue discontinued Mint flights to MiamiE:JetBlue TrueBlue launched Match to Mosaic program|American AAdvantage and Delta SkyMiles members can earn Mosaic 4 status|United MileagePlus status matches are no longer available|JetBlue TrueBlue will match status with Alaska Mileage Plan, American AAdvantage, Delta SkyMiles, Free Spirit, FrontierMiles, and Southwest Rapid Rewards|Eligible members can apply for a status match on this webpage|Status match is only valid for US residentsD:Offer valid through June 30, 2025|Mosaic 1 requires $1,000 in JetBlue spending or $10,000 on JetBlue credit cards|Mosaic 3 requires $4,000 in JetBlue spending or $40,000 on JetBlue credit cards|One tile is awarded for every $100 in qualifying JetBlue purchases|50 tiles unlock Mosaic 4 through December 31, 2026|Mosaic 4 includes six Move to Mint certificates;", "er_digest": "R:United States;", "gist": "P:JetBlue TrueBlue Match to Mosaic program offers elite status matches|Limited time offer for American AAdvantage and Delta SkyMiles elite members valid through June 30, 2025|Allows earning Mosaic 4 status|Airlines offer status match challenges to lure frequent flyers|JetBlue TrueBlue Match to Mosaic provides Mosaic 1 or 2 status for three months|Opportunity to maintain or \"level up\" to Mosaic 3|Requires earning tiles to maintain status|Mosaic 1 requires 10 tiles|Mosaic 2 requires 25 tiles|Mosaic 3 requires 40 tiles|One tile earned per $100 in JetBlue purchases or $1,000 on JetBlue credit cards|Earning 50 tiles unlocks Mosaic 4 through December 31, 2026|Mosaic 4 includes Signature Perks and four Perks You Pick choices|Status match requests take up to four weeks to process|Extended Mosaic status granted 3-7 days after challenge period|Eligible members receive Signature Perks during the three-month trial|Benefits include free checked bags, inflight drinks, same-day flight changes, priority boarding, and preferred seating|Mosaic 1 receives Mint Suite priority|Mosaic 2 receives a pet fee waiver|JetBlue is trying to increase revenue from its loyalty program|Offer available once every 24 months|JetBlue discontinued Mint flights to MiamiE:JetBlue TrueBlue launched Match to Mosaic program|American AAdvantage and Delta SkyMiles members can earn Mosaic 4 status|United MileagePlus status matches are no longer available|JetBlue TrueBlue will match status with Alaska Mileage Plan, American AAdvantage, Delta SkyMiles, Free Spirit, FrontierMiles, and Southwest Rapid Rewards|Eligible members can apply for a status match on this webpage|Status match is only valid for US residentsD:Offer valid through June 30, 2025|Mosaic 1 requires $1,000 in JetBlue spending or $10,000 on JetBlue credit cards|Mosaic 3 requires $4,000 in JetBlue spending or $40,000 on JetBlue credit cards|One tile is awarded for every $100 in qualifying JetBlue purchases|50 tiles unlock Mosaic 4 through December 31, 2026|Mosaic 4 includes six Move to Mint certificates;R:United States;", "entities": null, "regions": ["United States"]}, {"_id": "https://posetteconf.com/2025/schedule/", "content": "Back when I was as an engineer at Sun Microsystems, our dev team was co-located.

County of Humboldt\n, a case which asks the Court to incorporate the Seventh Amendment civil jury trial right through the Fourteenth Amendment against the States.\nThe Bill of Rights was originally enacted in 1791 to constrain Congress; protections against state overreach were left to state constitutions. But the Fourteenth Amendment was created to provide federal protection against state power; and since the Civil War, the Court has held (through a process called \"incorporation\") that nearly all the Bill of Rights applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe right to civil jury trial was among the three civil rights\nmost deeply rooted in American history and tradition at the time of the framing of the federal Bill of Rights along with the right to criminal jury trial and the right to the free exercise of religion.\nThe right is by far and away the most important right in the Bill of Rights that has not yet been incorporated; the other two unincorporated rights are the Third Amendment's protection against the quartering of soldiers in peoples' homes (a practice that no longer happens) and the right to indictment by a grand jury (which is meaningless since prosecutors can persuade grand juries to indict even \"\na ham sandwich\n\").\nCases like\nThomas v. County of Humboldt\n, which involve a dispute between the government and a private citizen, where petitioners are challenging millions of dollars of fines assessed against impoverished litigants in administrative proceedings by the government with no right to a civil jury trial, show that incorporation of the Seventh Amendment is as urgent as was incorporation of the Excessive Fines Clause in\nTimbs v. Indiana\n, 586 U.S. 146 (2019). As the Supreme Court held last year in\nSEC v. Jarkesy\n, 603 U.S. 109 (2024) (requiring the SEC to litigate fraud cases in federal district court with a Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury trial), \"[t]he right to trial by jury is 'of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right' has always been and 'should be scrutinized with the utmost care.'\"\nId.\nat 121. A continuing failure by the Supreme Court to incorporate the civil jury trial right against the States would thus be an embarrassing omission from the Court's caselaw given that this right is even more deeply rooted in American history and tradition than are almost any other right including especially the right to own a gun for one's own self-defense.\nThe\nThomas\ncase seeks to change that, and I think the Court should agree on this with the petitioners.\nIn 2010, the Supreme Court correctly incorporated the Second Amendment's right to own a gun for one's own self-defense in\nMcDonald v. City of Chicago\n, 561 U.S. 742 (2010) on a five to four vote. The Court held correctly that the right to own a gun for one's self-defense was a right that was\ndeeply rooted in American history and tradition following\nWashington v. Glucksberg\n, 521 U.S. 702 (1997). Accord,\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\n, 597 U.S. 215 (2022) (abortion rights are not deeply rooted in history and tradition).\nIn\nMcDonald\n, the Court observed that\n22 States out of 37 States in 1868\n, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, protected the right to keep and bear arms in their State Bills of Rights, i.e. 59% of the States at that time. Steven G. Calabresi & Sarah E. Agudo,\nIndividual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868: What Rights are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition?\n87 Texas L. Rev. 7, 50-55 (2008).\nSixty-one percent of the American people lived in those States in 1868\u2014a sizable super-majority.\nId.\nat 50. Based on this, and other evidence, the Court rightly concluded that the right to own a gun for one's own self-defense was very deeply rooted in American history and tradition. The Court reached this correct outcome even though in 1791, when the federal Bill of Rights was ratified, only\n5 States out of 12\nthat had written constitutions and Bills of Rights protected gun rights. Steven G. Calabresi, Sarah E. Agudo, and Kathryn L. Dore,\nState Bills of Rights in 1787 and 1791: What Individual Rights are Really Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition?\n, 85 Southern California Law Review 1451, 1485-1487 (2012).\nBut when it comes to the Seventh Amendment,\n36 out of 37 State Constitutions in 1868, guaranteed the right to jury trials in all civil or common law cases\n. Calabresi & Agudo,\nsupra\nat 77-78. \"\nFully 98% of all Americans in 1868 lived in jurisdictions where they had a fundamental state constitutional law right to jury trial in all civil or common law cases.\n\"\nId.\nat 77. The lone State in the Union not to recognize a right to civil jury trial in 1868 was Louisiana, which because of its French and Spanish roots in the civil law tradition found there to be no right to civil jury trial; in this, Louisiana diverged from all other states' common law tradition, which recognizes such a right. The case for the incorporation of the Seventh Amendment is much stronger than was the case for the incorporation of the Second Amendment (which, again, I think the Court was right to incorporate).\nIn 1791, when the federal Bill of Rights was ratified, 12 of the 14 States (the original 13 plus Vermont, which had just joined the Union) had new constitutions and Bills of Rights, while Rhode Island and Connecticut retained their colonial charters with all references to the King of Great Britain struck out. All 12 of these States protected the right to civil jury trial in their new State constitutions and Bills of Rights. Calabresi, Agudo & Dore,\nsupra\nat 1511. More than 85% of the American people lived in states with such constitutional protection of the right to civil jury trial.\nId.\nIn addition, Connecticut and Rhode Island also protected the right to civil jury trial even in the absence of newly crafted state constitutions.\nSee\nCharles W. Wolfram,\nThe Constitutional History of the Seventh Amendment\n, 57 Minn. L. Rev. 639, 655 (1973). \"In all of the thirteen original states formed after the outbreak of hostilities with England, the institution of civil jury trial was continued, either by express provision in a state constitution, by statute, or by continuation of the practices that had applied prior to the break with England.\"\nId.\nToday, forty-nine States representing 98% of the States and 98.5% of the U.S. population guarantee the right to jury trials in civil cases within their state constitutions, and Louisiana is the only outlier. Steven Gow Calabresi et al.,\nIndividual Rights Under State Constitutions in 2018: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in a Modern-Day Consensus of the States?\n, 94\nNotre Dame L. Rev.\n49, 113 (2018). But as the\nThomas\npetition for certiorari shows States are ignoring their State Constitutions (or at least reading them unduly narrowly), including in imposing outrageous multi-million-dollar fines in administrative proceedings against impoverished defendants.\nThe last time the Supreme Court considered in any detail whether to incorporate the Seventh Amendment was in 1916, 109 years ago, in\nMinneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis\n, 241 U.S. 211 (1916). To say the least, the Supreme Court's incorporation caselaw has shifted mightily since then, but the Court has never gone back and overruled\nBombolis\nas it should do now. The\nThomas\ncase presently before the Court shows why it is urgent to take that step right away.\nThe civil jury has a long and distinguished history in Anglo-American law. The great English Law commentator, William Blackstone, who was widely read by the framers of the Bill of Rights, wrote that jury trial was used \"for time out of mind\" in England,\nsee\nWilliam Blackstone, Commentaries 349; whether or not he was correct as a matter of history, his views were the basis for founding-era attitudes,\nsee\nWolfram,\nsupra\nat 653 n.44 (1973) (\"The framers all seem to have agreed that trial by jury could be traced back in an unbroken line to \u2026 Magna Charta\"). The Declaration of Independence complained in 1776 of \"pretended Legislation \u2026 depriving us in many cases of the benefit of Trial by Jury.\"\nThe Continental Congress in the Ordinance for the Northwest Territory ensured that the \"inhabitants of the said territory shall always be entitled to the benefits of \u2026 the trial by jury.\" An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States, Northwest of the River Ohio art. II (1787). And, importantly, the Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for jury trials in \"all suits at common law in which the United States sue,\"\neven before the ratification of the Seventh Amendment in 1791\n. An Act to Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States Section 9, 1 Stat. 73,77 (1789).\nThe absence of a civil-jury guarantee in the Constitution was among the Antifederalists' chief objections to the Constitution of 1787, and the Framers responded to this objection by putting the Seventh Amendment in the federal Bill of Rights. Several relevant themes emerge from their remarks from that era. For one, they concurred with Blackstone that the right was a critical check on abuses of power by tribunals of all stripes. A pseudonymous Farmer warned that juries were integral to curbing the power of corrupt judges, \"who may easily disguise law, by suppressing and varying fact,\" and stopping a backslide into \"despotism.\" Essays by a Farmer, Md. Gazette (March 21, 1788)\nin\n5 The Complete Anti-Federalist 36, 37-40 (Storing Ed. 1981).\nIn addition, the Antifederalists understood that the civil-jury guarantee was an especially vital shield for liberty in a particular context: suits between private citizens and the government as in\nThomas v. County of Humboldt\n. The pseudonymous Democratic Federalist warned in 1787 of possible abuses by military officers, excise or revenue officers, or constables:\n[I]n such cases a trial by jury would be our safest resource, heavy damages would at once punish the offender, and deter others from committing the same: but what satisfaction can we expect from a lordly court of justice, always ready to protect the officers of government against the weak and helpless citizen \u2026? What refuge shall we then have to shelter us from the iron hand of arbitrary power?\nSee\nLetter from a Democratic Federalist (Oct. 17, 1787),\nin\nThe Founders' Constitution 354 (P. Kurland & Ralph Lerner eds. 1987). The reference to \"excise or revenue officers\" makes clear that civil suits between citizens and either the federal or state governments like the one in this very case under discussion were especially worrisome.\nLikewise, James Monroe at the Virginia ratifying convention worried about the possible loss of the jury trial in tax disputes with the federal government.\nSee\n3 The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 218 (Jonathan Elliot ed. 1891). Monroe's concern about such suits is just as relevant in tax disputes between a private citizen, or a victim of police brutality, and a State revenue officer or a State police department.\nThe Antifederalists understood that the guarantee to a civil jury trial was, at its core, a republican ideal. The jury was to a judicial branch of government what the lower Houses of the federal or state legislatures were to the legislative branch:\nThe trial by jury is very important in another point of view. It is essential in every free country, that common people should have a part and share influence, in the judicial as well as in the legislative department. To hold open to them the offices of senators, judges, and offices to fill [for] which an expensive education is required, cannot answer any valuable purposes for them; they are not in a situation to be brought forward and fill those offices \u2026. The few, the well-born, etc. as Mr. Adams calls them, in judicial decisions as well as in legislation, are generally disposed and very naturally too, to favour those of their own description.\nThe trial by jury in the judicial department, and the collection of the people by their representatives in the legislature, are those fortunate inventions which have procured for them, in this country, their true proportion of influence, and the wisest and most fit means of protecting themselves in the community.\nLetter from the Federal Farmer, No. 4 (Oct. 12, 1787),\nin\n2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 249-50 (Storing Ed. 1981).\nThe first ever dictionary of the English language, as it was spoken in the United States, was Noah Webster's, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828). \u00a0Webster defines the word \"jury\" as follows (emphasis added): \"\nJU'RY\n,\nnoun\n[Latin juro, to swear.] A number of freeholders, selected in the manner prescribed by law, empaneled and sworn to inquire into and try any matter of fact, and to declare the truth on the evidence given them in the case. Grand juries consist usually of twenty four freeholders at least, and are summoned to try matters alleged in indictments.\nPetty juries, consisting usually of twelve men, attend courts to try matters of fact in civil causes\n, and to decide both the law and the fact in criminal prosecutions. The decision of a petty\njury\nis called a verdict.\" It is clear that Webster in 1828, thought there was a nearly **just to acknowledge the Louisiana exception** universal right to civil jury trial in all federal and state civil cases in the U.S., which there was.\nDuring the years leading up to the Civil War, abolitionists complained bitterly about the lack of federal or state jury trials in cases determining whether an alleged northerner, who happened to be Black, was, or was not, a fugitive slave. Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 269-270 (1998). For a full and persuasive argument that the Fourteenth Amendment demands what Amar calls the refined incorporation of the Seventh Amendment, one need only consult pages 269 to 278 of Amar's timeless and excellent book. The right to a civil jury trial was as foundational to the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment as it was to the Framers of the Bill of Rights. This is hardly surprising given that, as noted above, 36 out of 37 States constitutionally guaranteed a right to civil jury trial in 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.\nMy good and highly esteemed friend, Sam Bray, has urged on\nanother blog\nagainst the incorporation of the Seventh Amendment for what are, in my view, essentially policy reasons. Even if I agreed with Sam as a matter of policy\u2014and I do not, because of the ruinous effects of State use of administrative proceedings in multi-million dollar cases involving poor and abused litigants like those in\nThomas\n\u2014I think that the law here is quite clearly in favor of the incorporation of the Seventh Amendment, as is argued in\nAmar's spectacular\nbook cited above.\nSam's biggest concern is with what he fears would be the devastating effect that incorporating the law on civil jury trial, as it stood in 1791, would have on Delaware's Court of Chancery where most of the nation's corporations are chartered and where much corporate litigation takes place.\nProfessor Amar, and I, however,\ndo not\nthink that Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the law as to rights in the federal Bill of Rights as that law stood in 1791. Instead, we favor what Amar calls refined incorporation, which would among other things ask what the law was on civil jury trial rights, or on the division between law and equity, in 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, not what it was in 1791 when the Seventh Amendment was ratified.\nThomas\nis a Fourteenth Amendment case, unlike\nSEC v. Jarkesy\n, which was a Seventh Amendment case.\nAccordingly, the relevant original meaning in\nThomas\nis the original meaning of the civil jury trial right in 1868, not in 1791 as it was in\nJarkesy\n. I know that the U.S. Supreme Court has failed to accept this principle in its incorporation caselaw, but all true originalists must concede its truth. I have no idea how many of Sam's policy concerns are alleviated by shifting the time of origin from 1791 to 1868, but I do think that is the only lawful thing for an originalist to do.\nAnother good friend, and esteemed former co-author, Will Baude, has a\nblog post\nup in response to Sam's. Will argues, and I agree with him, that:\n[T]echnically speaking it's not that the Fourteenth Amendment\nmechanically\nincorporates\nthe enumerated rights in Amendments 1-8, it's that both the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause aimed to protect a range of fundamental rights.\nI think the civil jury probably was such a right. But once we see the issue through the general law lens, it's easier to remember that incorporating the fundamental right still left it open to reasonable regulations within each state. So protecting the fundamental right to a civil jury shouldn't mean, as\nSam fears,\nlocking every state \"into the English division between law and equity in 1791\" or detonating \"a neutron bomb on the Delaware Court of Chancery.\"\nI agree that general law \"incorporated\" Fourteenth Amendment rights, drawn from the first eight amendments to the federal Constitution, which are constitutionally protected vis-\u00e0-vis the States according to what they meant in 1868. I also agree with Will that such rights can be regulated under the State police power given the statement in\nCorfield v. Coryell\n, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (C.C.E.D.Pa. 1823) that all federal privileges or immunities are \"subject nevertheless to such restraints as the government may justly prescribe for the general good of the whole.\" Reasonableness review under this language might leave some variation in how Delaware draws the law/equity line from how it might be drawn in other States. Mechanical incorporation of the Bill of Rights against the States with every right given only the meaning it had in 1791 and not in 1868 would be unwise, especially given that it's the likely outcome of the Court's agreeing to incorporate the Seventh Amendment. But that is not the sort of incorporation I mean to defend here.\nFinally, the Institute for Justice has also\nresponded\nto Sam Bray, and I agree with pretty much all of that response. But IJ does not comment on Will Baude's post, and that post I think contemplates a more originalist, more meaningful, and more flexible form of incorporation than is contemplated in IJ's petition for certiorari in\nThomas.\nIn any event, the Roberts' Court can certainly come up with a better reading of the relationship between the Seventh and the Fourteenth Amendments than did the White Court in\nMinneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis\n(1916), which is an excellent reason to grant certiorari on Thursday, June 12th.\nThe post\nShould the Seventh Amendment Civil Jury Trial Right Apply to the States?\nappeared first on\nReason.com\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Seventh Amendment incorporation|Civil jury trial right|Fourteenth Amendment|Thomas v.

They are the millions of people around the world who live with pacemakers and insulin pumps implanted in their augmented bodies.\nBut when things go wrong with their devices, cyborgs are victims of an extremely prosaic issue: they have pathetic consumer protections, even when the device in question is life-sustaining. Between 2008 and 2018, more than\n80,000 deaths\nand 1.7 million injuries worldwide were linked to the failure of various medical implants (things like prosthetic hips, spinal stimulators, or cardiac devices).\nThe reason? For-profit healthcare organizations have a history of prioritizing bottom lines over bioethics. When promising quality products threatens a company\u2019s financial standing, patients are quickly abandoned. Stories like these are very common:\nSecond Sight Medical Products\nterminated\nbionic eye user Barbara Campbell\u2019s\nvision while she transferred subways in the middle of a New York City station. Nuvectra went bankrupt and orphaned their spinal-cord stimulators in\n3,000 patients\n. Boston Scientific ignored a known defect in their pacemakers that resulted in electrical arcing, and at least one patient died due to their cardiac device short-circuiting\nwhile inside of their chest\n.\nDue to high costs, obsolescence, and design flaws, patients need devices that actually last a lifetime. Pacemaker failures specifically are often the result of complications from their lithium-ion battery. Because of their checkered history, scientists are seeking new ways to harvest energy to power devices that don\u2019t rely on batteries. For an experimental lab in South Korea, that means banking on our own organs for electricity, a radical move that could challenge the fundamental paradigms of patient\u2019s rights laws. Their recent\nAdvanced Materials\npublication\ninvestigates whether pacemakers can be powered by the expansion and contraction of the wearer\u2019s own heart.\nPiezoelectric materials can convert mechanical force into an electric charge. Engineers implement this type of hardware to harvest compression on\npavement\nbeneath heavy vehicles, to harvest tidal wave energy off the coast of\nOahu, Hawai\u2019i\n, and even to harvest body movement within a\nT-shirt\n. The lab at Hanyang University in Seoul led by Seon Jeong Kim put those circuits outside the heart.\nThis post is for subscribers only\nSign up now to read the post and get access to the full library of posts for subscribers only.\nSign up now\nAlready have an account?\nSign in\nMembership\nUnlock full access to\nSequencer\nand see the entire library of\npaid-members\nonly posts\nSee our plans\nPssst!

provide property tax breaks and other incentives for siting solar projects on brownfields and former coal mines.\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio\nsigned into law House Bill 15\n, a technology-neutral energy policy package that included significant beneficial changes for solar development in the state.\nThe new law, effective Aug. 14, 2025, includes property tax breaks for solar projects located on brownfield sites and former coal mines. The law also carves out funding for grants of up to $10 million each for the cleanup and remediation of these sites.\nGovernor DeWine announced the Department of Development is awarding the funding as part of the Ohio Brownfield Remediation Program. The funding includes approximately $57.7 million for 43 cleanup/remediation projects and $1.7 million for eight assessment projects.\nSince its launch in 2021, the Ohio Brownfield Remediation Program has awarded $716.9 million to 681 projects in 86 counties. Funding is used to assess and clean up industrial commercial, and institutional brownfield sites that are abandoned, idled or underutilized due to a known or potential release of hazardous substances or petroleum.\nHouse Bill 15 also loosens restrictions on small-scale distributed behind-the-meter solar projects. Under the revised code electric distribution utilities may supply behind-the-meter generation service. The bill, which can be\nread in full text here\n, specifies which costs can be recovered by utilities providing behind-the-meter service.\n\u201cThis is just smart economic development. We need the energy,\u201d said Michael Benson, board president of Green Energy Ohio, a coalition of clean energy businesses in the state.\nA study by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in 2021 showed that\nlandfills in the United States could host more than 63 GW of solar capacity\n, generating 83 TWh of electricity each year. This would equate to $6.6 billion in annual electricity revenues, according to RMI. There are more than 10,000 closed and inactive landfills across the nation. These sites often offer good sun exposure and little opportunity for other uses.\nA 2024 report from the Nature Conservancy found that nationwide, there are about 500 renewable energy projects sited on brownfields and mine lands. It said that in Ohio, during the past two decades, many mines in the state have shuttered or downsized operations. The Nature Conservancy identified roughly 567,600 acres of mine lands, mostly in eastern Ohio, with access to transmission lines that are potentially suitable for renewable energy development.\nImage: The Nature Conservancy", "ped_digest": "P:New law provides property tax breaks and incentives for solar projects on brownfields and former coal mines|Loosens restrictions on small-scale distributed behind-the-meter solar projects|Supports cleanup and remediation of brownfield sites|Promotes economic development and energy production;E:Gov.

Safras e Mercado says 57% of Brazil\u2019s 2024/25 crop has been marketed, with early sales for 2025/26 at just nearly 11%.Corn was lower on fund and technical selling. Crop conditions generally look favorable, with rain and mostly seasonal temperatures in the near-term forecast for the region. As of Sunday, 71% of the crop is in good to excellent shape, 2% higher, with 97% planted and 87% emerged. U.S. corn export inspections continued to exceed the USDA\u2019s projected pace, up on both the week and the year, with Mexico and Taiwan leading the way. The USDA could raise its old crop export guess Thursday in the monthly supply and demand report because of the shipments and sales seen even into the final quarter of the marketing year. CONAB\u2019s updated numbers for Brazil are also out Thursday, with probable adjustments for first and second crop production.The wheat complex was lower on fund and technical selling. Recent rainfall has generally benefited winter wheat conditions but has also delayed early harvest activity and led to some disease issues. For winter wheat, 54% is rated good to excellent, a gain of 2%, with 88% headed and 4% harvested, behind average due to rain. For spring wheat, 53% of the crop is reported as good to excellent, 3% above a week ago, with 82% emerged. Dry weather is an ongoing concern in parts of China and the Black Sea region, along with areas of the northern U.S. Plains and the Canadian Prairies. Near-term forecasts for portions of the European Union are mostly favorable. Wheat export inspections have started 2025/26 on a slow note, falling below both the prior week and this time last year, mostly to Mexico and the Philippines.\n0 comments\nTags:\nAg

Evans recently opened up about his exclusion from\nAvengers: Doomsday\n, and his words were tinged with a kind of bittersweet sadness that fans are already interpreting as a subtle dig at Marvel\u2019s decision-making.\nSpeaking with\nScreenrant\nfor his upcoming movie\nMaterialists\n\u2014 a project that pairs him with Dakota Johnson and Pedro Pascal \u2014 Evans was asked the inevitable question about his absence from the MCU\u2019s next big team-up movie. His response was candid, heartfelt, and yes, a little heartbreaking. While he didn\u2019t outright criticize Marvel, Evans admitted that it\u2019s tough to watch from the sidelines as his former collaborators \u2014 the Russo Brothers, who directed some of the most beloved MCU films, and Robert Downey Jr., who\u2019s returning as Doctor Doom \u2014gear up for another Marvel blockbuster. \u201c\nIt\u2019s sad to not be back with the band\n,\u201d he said, summing up what so many fans have been feeling since his departure.\nWhen Steve Rogers handed over his iconic shield to Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) at the end of\nAvengers: Endgame\n, it was meant to be a definitive goodbye. Evans himself has spoken about wanting to leave the character on a high note, rather than overstaying his welcome. And to his credit,\nEndgame\ngave Steve Rogers a perfect send-off \u2014 a poignant, time-bending finale in which he chose love and a quiet life over endless battles.\nChris Evans says he\u2019s sad he won\u2019t be returning as Steve Rogers in \u2018AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY\u2019\n\u201cI'm sure they're doing something incredible, and I'm sure it's going to be that much harder when it comes out and you feel like you weren't invited to the party.\u201d\n(via\u2026\npic.twitter.com/lCcq9607pp\n\u2014 Cosmic Marvel (@cosmic_marvel)\nJune 9, 2025\nBut even the most definitive\nendings in Hollywood rarely stay that way\n. Over the past year, rumors have swirled about Evans potentially reprising his role in\nAvengers: Doomsday\n. Speculation reached a fever pitch when reports suggested that Evans and Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter) might make appearances together, sparking hopes that Steve Rogers would somehow be woven into the MCU\u2019s next phase. Marvel, as always, remained tight-lipped, refusing to confirm or deny anything. And now, with Evans\u2019 latest remarks, it seems\nthose rumors were just that\n\u2014 rumors.\nStill, it\u2019s hard not to feel like something is missing when you consider what\nAvengers: Doomsday\nis shaping up to be.

But getting to know who he was through those he loves is what catapulted the character from\nRogue One\none-off into the pantheon of beloved\nStar Wars\nheroes. Seeing the added layers of his family and friend circle captivated audiences and introduced us to even more characters we hope to see more of in the future, including his partner and romantic interest, Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona).\nA rebel heroine in her own right\n, Caleen pretty much stole our hearts too, but dashed the hopes of Jyn Erso and Cassian shippers across the fandom galaxy.\nThe fleeting tension in Rogue\nOne\n\u2018s elevator scene between the two rebels on the trail of the Death Star plans\u2014who then embrace one another in their final moments\u2014had the fandom taking the mere tease of a romance to mean more. It\u2019s something\nAndor\ncreator and\nRogue One\nco-writer\nTony Gilroy\nis well aware of.\n\u201cI knew very well what had happened with Jyn and Cassian in\nRogue One\nand what had happened in the elevator,\u201d he told\nCollider\n; it\u2019s something he truncated in the process of re-working the film (there was a kiss shot originally).\n\u201cI knew that scene very, very well. I probably went back and looked at that. I was pleased to see that my memory of it was of all the other takes and other things, and I was really pleased to see how we\u2019d edited that, that it was really ambiguous about what it was, and then I didn\u2019t care anymore. I was like, \u2018Okay. It makes sense.\u2019\u201d\nHe explained that Cassian and Bix\u2019s love story realistically explores the dynamic of two people who have been in each other\u2019s lives for longer than a mission, and who we meet while they\u2019re very much not together. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re both pretty sexually liberated in their way,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that first kiss they had, I think the first person they ever slept with is each other. Who knows how old they were on Ferrix? Probably very, very young. And over time, they were together and not together.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve clearly had their own separate life experiences. \u201cTimm starts off the show, and who\u2019s in charge of that relationship, right?\u201d Gilroy said, calling out Bix\u2019s not-long-for-the-world jealous beau on Ferrix. \u201c\nCassian certainly has a rich history in just the little bit we see, and has alluded to, and his mother calls him out on all his girlfriends, and there\u2019s Windi on Niamos. I think they have a very healthy idea of what the different calibrations of love are.\u201d\nSo yes, Cassian and Jyn may have had a moment but its informed by the knowledge of their win against the Empire. \u201cI mean, why wouldn\u2019t you hold somebody\u2019s hand at the end of the world?\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI felt bad for the people who had invested so much time in the fan fiction and stuff like that. The people who really had gone deep on it. It\u2019s not considered canon, and it\u2019s not something I have to pay attention to, legally, within the order, but people worked hard on that stuff, and it meant a lot to them. You don\u2019t want to trample on somebody\u2019s flower garden, you know? But I have to do what I have to do.\u201d\nAs the writer, who is actual steward of the lore, Gilroy at least offered his condolences for blasting the ship along with the Scarif shore Cassian and Jyn held each other on, stating, \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s somebody who will never get over that. I apologize. I really do.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

And clearly, power can beat even blood, as the billionaire\u2019s father has chosen to ditch his son as well.\nThere is no love lost between Errol Musk and his son. Elon has described his father, on many occasions and in many colorful words, as a \u201cterrible human being\u201d and someone who is \u201cevil.\u201d As for Errol, he has always been painfully critical of his son, even telling an Australian radio station in 2022 that he wasn\u2019t proud of Elon and said he \u201cneeds to take a weight loss pill.\u201d\nEvidently, he has no plans of ever quitting insulting his son with his cutting,\npublic\nremarks.\nSo far, Trump and Elon\u2019s bickering match has only managed to make a mockery of America, with\neven Russia making fun of the fight\nand offering everything from asylum to the billionaire to brokering a peace deal. And just like Russia, which believes that Trump will beat Musk in this battle and force the Tesla CEO to seek asylum, Musk\u2019s father also believes that his son will lose this fight.\nDuring a\npolitical conference in Moscow\n, Errol claimed his son was \u201cPTSD from the White House\u201d and added that it was stress that made Elon go against Trump, who will rise as the victor in their petty tantrum battle.\n\u201cTrump will prevail \u2013 he\u2019s the president, he was elected as the president. So, you know, Elon made a mistake, I think. But he is tired, he is stressed.\u201d\nSeemingly an avid fan of Trump \u2013 and Putin, whom he called a \u201cvery stable and pleasant man\u201d being maligned by Western media \u2013 Errol went on to double down on painting a picture where Elon was unstable, given the months of stress he handled to keep Trump\u2019s campaign alive and then running DOGE. \u201cThey are very tired and stressed, so you can expect something like this,\u201d he added.\nBut he believes that the feud between Elon and Trump is very \u201csmall\u201d and would be \u201cover tomorrow.\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s debatable.\nSince the drama started \u2013 with Musk openly and brashly thrashing Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2013 it has only escalated, with the former going so far as to accuse the president of being in the controversial Epstein files. In retaliation, the POTUS has threatened to put a stop to U.S. government contracts with the likes of Tesla and SpaceX.\nHow will their bromance bounce back from something like this? It might. After all, stranger things have happened in America.

Known for pioneering a genre-bending fusion of funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic sound, Stone passed away peacefully surrounded by family after a long battle with COPD and other health issues.\n\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved dad, Sly Stone,\u201d his family shared in a statement on June 9. \u201cWhile we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come.\u201d\nA Soundtrack That Shaped Culture\nBorn Sylvester Stewart in Denton, Texas, in 1943, Sly moved to California early in life and grew up singing gospel in the church with his siblings. His nickname \u201cSly\u201d came from a classmate\u2019s typo, and once he changed his surname to Stone, his siblings Freddie and Rose \u2014 who would later join his band \u2014 followed suit.\nSly Stone (center, with George Clinton to the left) at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 1993.\nJeff Kravitz\\ Getty Images\nBy high school, Sly was already performing in bands and went on to study music theory at Solano Community College before becoming a DJ at San Francisco\u2019s KSOL, helping shape the city\u2019s soul scene.\nIn 1966, Sly and Freddie merged their groups \u2014 Sly and the Stoners and Freddie and the Stone Souls \u2014 into what would become Sly and the Family Stone. \u201cThe band had a concept,\u201d Sly wrote in his 2023 memoir\nThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\n. \u201cWhite and Black together, male and female both, and women not just singing but playing instruments. That was a big deal back then, and it was a big deal on purpose.\u201d\nChart-Topping Hits and Cultural Impact\nWith smash hits like \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEveryday People,\u201d and \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\u201d Sly and the Family Stone changed the face of American music. The group\u2019s inclusive lineup and infectious grooves helped define an era of social change, musical experimentation, and cultural pride.\nThough the band officially broke up in the 1980s \u2014 largely due to Sly\u2019s well-documented struggles with addiction \u2014 their influence never faded. Tributes continue to pour in from generations of artists who credit Sly\u2019s sound as a cornerstone of modern funk, hip-hop, and soul.\nSly Stone in 2015.\nMark Weiss/Getty Images\nA Legacy Still in Motion\nIn recent years, Sly had kept a low profile but was working on creative projects, including a screenplay based on his life. That project followed the release of his 2024 memoir, which gave fans a rare glimpse into his rise, fall, and reflections on music, fame, and redemption.\n\u201cSly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,\u201d his family\u2019s statement continued. \u201cWe extend our deepest gratitude for the outpouring of love and prayers during this difficult time.\u201d\nStone is survived by his three children and extended family, who say they hope to share his story in full through the screenplay he completed shortly before his death.\nHis music may have started on a turntable, but it lives on in the rhythm of every generation since.\nThe post\nSly Stone Dies at 82\nappeared first on\nsaobserver\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Pioneering funk musician Sly Stone has died at 82|Stone's music fused funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic sounds|His band, Sly and the Family Stone, championed inclusivity and social change|Stone's legacy continues to inspire generations of artists;E:Sly Stone passed away peacefully on June 9 surrounded by family|Sly and Freddie merged their bands to form Sly and the Family Stone in 1966|The band officially broke up in the 1980s|Stone released a memoir in 2024;D:Stone was born Sylvester Stewart in 1943|He was 82 years old|He battled COPD and other health issues|The band had hits like \"Dance to the Music,\" \"Everyday People,\" and \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\"|He was working on a screenplay based on his life;", "er_digest": "N:Solano Community College|KSOL|George Clinton|Freddie Stone|Jeff Kravitz|Mark Weiss|Rose Stone|Sly Stone;R:San Francisco|California;", "gist": "P:Pioneering funk musician Sly Stone has died at 82|Stone's music fused funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic sounds|His band, Sly and the Family Stone, championed inclusivity and social change|Stone's legacy continues to inspire generations of artists;E:Sly Stone passed away peacefully on June 9 surrounded by family|Sly and Freddie merged their bands to form Sly and the Family Stone in 1966|The band officially broke up in the 1980s|Stone released a memoir in 2024;D:Stone was born Sylvester Stewart in 1943|He was 82 years old|He battled COPD and other health issues|The band had hits like \"Dance to the Music,\" \"Everyday People,\" and \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\"|He was working on a screenplay based on his life;N:Solano Community College|KSOL|George Clinton|Freddie Stone|Jeff Kravitz|Mark Weiss|Rose Stone|Sly Stone;R:San Francisco|California;", "entities": ["Solano Community College", "KSOL", "George Clinton", "Freddie Stone", "Jeff Kravitz", "Mark Weiss", "Rose Stone", "Sly Stone"], "regions": ["San Francisco", "California"]}, {"_id": "https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/10/horoscope-today-june-10-2025-astrological-predictions-star-sign-23366055/", "content": "What\u2019s in store for you today?

The problem was that composite material had never been utilized for the purposes he intended, and the carbon fibers eventually began to snap long before the submersible imploded in 2023. Colleagues and experts alike warned Rush that the vessel was unsafe, but as the doc makes clear, he didn\u2019t listen. Rush also refused to have it examined by a third party for safety classification.\nVariety\nfilm critic Dennis Harvey compared \u201cTitan: The OceanGate Disaster\u201d to Werner Herzog\u2019s \u201cGrizzly Man\u201d \u2013\n\u201cin that this is also a portrait of death by ego-driven\nhubris in which one victim shoulders all the posthumous blame.\u201d\nStory Syndicate\u2019s head of documentary and nonfiction, Jon Bardin, said that while the OceanGate disaster was initially intriguing, the production company did extensive research before getting behind the project.\n\u201cWith any story like this, we ask the question, \u2018Is there a deeper story to tell? Is there more to this than the headlines, social media reaction, and just the horror of what took place that day?\u2019 That\u2019s the sort of research and digging that we did from the beginning, and we found out that the answer to our question was yes.\u201d\n\u201cTitan: The OceanGate Disaster\u201d made its world premiere at Tribeca Fest on June 6.\nVariety\nspoke to Monroe and Bardin ahead of the doc\u2019s June 11 release on Netflix.\nJon, what did you find during your digging that convinced you that this story could be a doc?\nBardin:\nWhen we met David Lochridge (former OceanGate director of marine operations ) we understood that there was a story to tell because, as you see in the film, he was shouting from the rooftops internally and then externally that something was wrong. The way Stockton treated him and his wife after he said something was wrong was also compelling.\nMark, was there a larger story you were trying to tell with this doc\n?\nMonroe:\nYes. There is a culture of people who exist in our society who believe that the rules don\u2019t apply to them. That actually, it is an advantage to, as they say, break stuff and move fast. In this story, we saw that again and again.\nThe behind-the-scenes footage of Rush creating OceanGate and the vessel was fascinating. How did you find the footage and get the rights to use it?\nMonroe:\nOur producer, Lily Garrison, found the videographer who shot that footage. He was hired as a guy to document the fruition of Stockton\u2019s dream from the start of the whole thing, which tells you the kind of ego that Stockton had. He wanted people to film him in the earliest days as he set off on this journey. We have to thank Stockton for that footage because he made deals in which the rights to the material stayed with the shooter.\nStockton\u2019s wife, Wendy, who was very involved in OceanGate, and their children are not in the doc. Did you request interviews with them?\nMonroe:\nWe had a producer who had access to them and it became very clear very early on that there would be no talking.\nIn May, Warner Bros. Discovery released their OceanGate doc titled \u201cImplosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster.\u201d It\u2019s not unusual that two or even three docs about a popular topic get made, but was the Discovery doc a cause for concern during production\n?\nMonroe:\nIt didn\u2019t really affect me because of David Lochridge.\nBardin:\nThat was a critical part of the early producing work \u2013 to build trust with folks like David and other characters in the film, so that they were willing to work exclusively with us. You won\u2019t see David in these other films because we had an exclusive relationship with him, and that\u2019s built on time and trust.\nMonroe:\nI knew what I had, and I knew what they would not have. To me, that felt like a key asset, a key perspective. But look, with a big story like this, there is probably more to come.\nJump to Comments\nMore from Variety\n\u2018Sons of the Neon Night\u2019 Review: Juno Mak\u2019s Long-Delayed Hong Kong Action Drama Is Paper Thin\n\u2018Predator: Killer of Killers\u2019 Review: Gruesome Animated Triptych Travels Through Time With the Ruthless Extra-Terrestrials\nCynthia Erivo Proves She\u2019s a Threat as a Singer-Songwriter, Too, With Subtle but Powerful \u2018I Forgive You\u2019: Album Review\n\u2018From the World of John Wick: Ballerina\u2019 Review: Ana de Armas Fights \u2018Like a Girl\u2019 \u2014 That Is, Like Jane Wick \u2014 in an Entertaining Ultraviolent Spin-Off\n\u2018I Only Rest in the Storm\u2019 Review: A Sprawling Narrative That Demands Patience and Attention\n\u2018Love Me Tender\u2019 Review: Vicky Krieps Ignites an Elegant and Moving Portrait of Motherhood at Odds With Selfhood\nLoading comments...\nMore From Our Brands\nRolling Stone\nRole Model Drops Out of Several Gracie Abrams Shows to Film Netflix\u2019s \u2018Good Sex\u2019\nRobb Report\nThis $24 Million Boston Home Doubles as an Art Gallery\nSportico\nPenn State, UCLA Deny Deals With Elevate\u2019s New College Sports\u00a0Fund\nTVLine\nSave the Dates: Love Island Spinoff, Magic City Docuseries and More\nad", "ped_digest": "P:OceanGate disaster|Stockton Rush's hubris|Carbon fiber hull failure|Safety concerns ignored|David Lochridge's warnings|Documentary examines circumstances|Ego-driven behavior|Rules don't apply|Breaking stuff and moving fast|Titanic wreckage|North Atlantic|Netflix documentary|Tribeca Fest premiere;E:Submersible implosion|Fatal 2023 disaster|Rush's quest to become a billionaire innovator|Former employees' warnings|OceanGate expedition ending in tragedy|World premiere at Tribeca Fest|Release on Netflix|Warner Bros.

He was 82. The cause of death was a \u201cprolonged battle with COPD and other underlying health issues,\u201d according to a statement by his family.\n\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved\u00a0dad,\u00a0Sly Stone of\nSly and the Family Stone\n,\u201d Stone\u2019s family said. \u201cSly passed away peacefully, surrounded by his three children, his closest friend, and his extended family. While we mourn his absence, we take solace in knowing that his extraordinary musical legacy will continue to resonate and inspire for generations to come.\u201d\nThe family added that Stone \u201crecently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course.\u201d\nAt the peak of his success, when hits like \u201cDance to the Music\u201d and \u201cEveryday People\u201d were high on the charts, the wildly inventive musician and singer presented a glowingly optimistic image in step with the times, bringing together Black and white audiences, uplifting crowds with electrifying shows. But the unpredictability that was the core of his genius gave way to a long decline, as his personal demons destroyed what he had once been.\nBorn Sylvester Stewart in Texas in 1943, Stone started making music with his siblings as a child: The Stewart Four (Sylvester, his sisters Rose and Vaetta, and his brother Freddie) made their first single, \u201cOn the Battlefield,\u201d in 1952. He moved to California with his family as a kid, and later became a familiar voice in the Bay Area\u2019s music scene. As a staff producer at Autumn Records, he put together hits like Bobby Freeman\u2019s \u201cC\u2019mon and Swim\u201d; he also produced \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d by Grace Slick\u2019s pre-Jefferson Airplane band, the Great Society. He was also a DJ on KSOL and KDIA, and later noted that \u201cin radio, I found out about a lot of things I don\u2019t like. Like, I think there shoudn\u2019t be \u2018Black radio.\u2019 Just radio. Everybody be a part of everything.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s picks\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\nThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\nStone\u2019s own band, Sly & the Family Stone, came together over the course of 1966 and 1967. It really was a family of sorts: Sly and his siblings Rose and Freddie were joined by cousins Greg Errico and Jerry Martini, as well as bassist Larry Graham and trumpeter Cynthia Robinson. The Family Stone\u2019s breakthrough hit was 1968\u2019s \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d in which their voices and instruments, high and low, each took a turn in the spotlight. A racially mixed band with male and female members, playing soul-infused rock together was a rare sight at the time \u2014 a utopian vision of what pop music could be.\nHits like \u201cLife,\u201d \u201cStand!,\u201d \u201cEveryday People,\u201d and \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime\u201d followed: all anthems of solidarity and joy that acknowledged the pain and frustration of the times and encouraged their audiences to transcend it. Sly & the Family Stone\u2019s\nsoaring performance\nof \u201cI Want to Take You Higher\u201d at Woodstock in 1969 was a triumph of that era, and the band finished the decade with an enormous hit: \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\u201d whose joyful funk masked the existential horror and lacerating sarcasm of its lyrics.\nTheir next album was supposed to be called\nThe Incredible and Unpredictable Sly & the Family Stone\n\u2014 a sideways reference to Stone\u2019s habit of blowing off gigs. He finally released his masterpiece,\nThere\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On\n, in late 1971. Recorded with help from Bobby Womack and an early drum machine, it was a bleak, scarred, wobbly vision \u2014 the soured remains of the Sixties dream. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of his like, help the medicine go down approach,\u201d Questlove\ntold\nRolling Stone\nin March\n. \u201cHe paints a very dark, lyric, paranoia, self-confessional thing almost in every record, but it\u2019s so happy-sounding.\u201d\nRelated Content\nWayne Lewis, Founding Member of Atlantic Starr, Dead at 68\nGeorge Wendt\u2019s Cause of Death Revealed\nHear Sly and the Family Stone Rock a Small Club in 1967 With Funky \u2018I Gotta Go Now\u2019\nJonathan Joss, \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Voice Actor, Fatally Shot at 59\nThe Family Stone disintegrated over the next few years, as Sly sank deep into drug abuse and became even more erratic. He married Kathy Silva on stage in front of a crowd of 20,000 at a sold-out Madison Square Garden show in 1974, but within months, the band had broken up, and the marriage, which produced a son, Sylvester Jr., didn\u2019t last much longer. \u201cHe beat me, held me captive, and wanted me to be in m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois,\u201d Silva said years later. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that world of drugs and weirdness.\u201d Sylvia left in 1976. Sly had two more children, Sylvette and Novena Carmel.\nSly persevered, making one attempt after another to win back the public: His 1976 album was called\nHeard Ya Missed Me, Well I\u2019m Back\n, and the one that followed it three years later\nBack on the Right Track\n. After 1982\u2019s half-finished\nAin\u2019t But the One Way\n, he never released another album of new, original material, despite persistent rumors that he was working on the magical record that would get his career back on its feet. He collaborated with George Clinton, on whom he\u2019d been a huge influence; he turned up for guest vocals on records by the Bar-Kays and Earth, Wind and Fire.\nStone\u2019s personal troubles continued. He was arrested for cocaine possession multiple times in the 1980s, and he served 14 months in a rehab center beginning in 1989. Between Sly & the Family Stone\u2019s 1993 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the 2006 tribute to them at the Grammy Awards (for which Sly appeared for a few minutes with an enormous blond mohawk, then wandered off), he all but vanished. Interviewed by\nVanity Fair\nin 2007, he claimed he had \u201ca library\u201d of new material, \u201ca hundred and some songs, or maybe 200.\u201d In 2011, the\nNew York Post\nreported that he was living in a camper van in Los Angeles; that same year, he released\nI\u2019m Back! Family & Friends\n, mostly lackluster new rerecordings of his Sixties classics.\nBut the specter of his glory years remained. Stone\u2019s great 1960s and early-Seventies records inspired Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock to incorporate electric instruments and funk grooves into jazz; Prince and the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Roots have all covered Sly & the Family Stone songs.\nA\u00a0little over a year after the release of Stone\u2019s autobiography,\nThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\n, a documentary, 2025\u2019s\nSly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius)\n, reexamined Stone\u2019s legacy. The film, directed by Questlove, focused on how Stone\u2019s legacy and influence continues to reverberate through popular music along with how Stone carried the weight of that influence personally until it became a burden.\n\u201cMy intent was always to use Sly Stone to tell our story, my story, D\u2019Angelo\u2019s story, Lauryn Hill\u2019s story, Frank Ocean\u2019s story,\u201d Questlove told\nRolling Stone\n. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about \u2018blowing it,\u2019 a lot of times the fear of failing or the fear of returning to where you came from \u2014 which is the very bottom \u2014 causes you anxiety about your future, and then causes you to fumble it.\u201d\nTrending Stories\nSly Stone, Family Stone Architect Who Fused Funk, Rock, and Soul, Dead at 82\nSorry, That\u2019s Not Wyatt Russell in the Viral L.A.

We were best friends for 60 years. He credits me with starting the band, but it was his musical genius that made music history,\u201d Martini said in a statement to\nRolling Stone\n. \u201cHe will always be in my heart and I will continue to celebrate his music with the Family Stone. We extend our sincere love, condolences and prayers to his children and his family. Rest well my dear friend.

Currently, 3GB modules are\navailable\nfor purchase in China. These modules are primarily used in the RTX 5090 laptop graphics cards, which offer 24GB of VRAM with a 256-bit bus. However, these modules can also be used to upgrade current desktop graphics cards.\nUpgrading the RTX 5090 with 48GB Memory\nWith the availability of these 3GB GDDR7 modules, it\u2019s now possible to replace the 32GB memory on the RTX 5090 desktop models with 48GB. This configuration is not entirely new, as NVIDIA\u2019s RTX PRO 6000 model already uses 3GB modules to achieve a total of 96GB (48GB per side).\nFuture Upgrades and SUPER Models\nFor users looking for even more memory, they can buy these new modules and swap them into their current RTX 50 series cards to increase their memory capacity. A new SUPER version of the current generation is also expected, offering more memory. For example, the RTX 5080 SUPER could have 24GB using these 3GB modules, the RTX 5070 SUPER could reach 18GB, and the RTX 5060 could increase to 12GB.\nHowever, it seems like it\u2019s still too early to think about the SUPER models, as NVIDIA has not yet finished the current RTX 50 series. The final model of this generation, RTX 5050, is expected to be presented in July.\nTags\ngddr7\nRTX 5090\nsamsung\nSolomon Thompson\nSend an email\n23 minutes ago\nLast Updated: June 9, 2025\n0\n504\nWhatsApp\nTelegram\nShare via Email\nPrint\nSolomon Thompson\nRead Next\nNews\n23 seconds ago\nGears of War: Reloaded Will Not Release on PS5 in Japan, But Xbox and PC Versions Are Still Coming\nNews\n15 minutes ago\nMicrosoft Unveils New ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X Portable Consoles with AMD Z2 Series Processors\nNews\n4 hours ago\nGears Of War: Reloaded Announced and Expected to Release August 26th\nNews\n15 hours ago\nMicrosoft Store to Get a Major Makeover, New Features and Improvements Coming Soon\nNews\n18 hours ago\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy XVI Announced for Xbox\nNews\n19 hours ago\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 Announced with Trailer, Available on Game Pass at Launch\nNews\n2 days ago\nIO Interactive is Working on a Cooperative Mode for Hitman: World of Assassination\nNews\n2 days ago\nIntel Releases New Arc Graphics Driver 32.0.101.6877 Beta to Fix Audio Issues in Portable Consoles\nNews\n2 days ago\nNintendo Switch 2 May Have Already Set a Sales Record\nNews\n3 days ago\nBorderlands 2 Accused of Spying on Your Computer, Now Has \u2018Extremely Negative\u2019 Reviews\nNews\n3 days ago\nRAZER Introduces the New Phantom Collection\nNews\n3 days ago\nBlack Myth: Wukong for Xbox Series X|S Gets Official Release Date in August 2025\nNews\n3 days ago\nNVIDIA Leads GPU Market in Q1 2025 with 92% Share, AMD Drops to 8% and Intel at 0%\nNews\n3 days ago\nASUS Unleashes Prime MR120 Case Fans for Quiet and Colourful Cooling\nNews\n3 days ago\nSynology Unleashes the DS425+\nNews\n4 days ago\nIntel Integrated GPU Overclocked to 4.25 GHz, Beating GeForce RTX 4090 Record\nNews\n4 days ago\nElden Ring Nightreign Director Claims He Beat All Bosses Solo and Without Relics\nNews\n4 days ago\nNintendo Switch 2 Packaging Is So Thin That a Simple Staple Can Damage Its Screen\nNews\n4 days ago\nNintendo Switch 1 Games Perform Better on Switch 2 Even Without Updates\nNews\n4 days ago\nFirst Patch for The Elder Scrolls IV Remaster Released\n23 seconds ago\nGears of War: Reloaded Will Not Release on PS5 in Japan, But Xbox and PC Versions Are Still Coming\n15 minutes ago\nMicrosoft Unveils New ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X Portable Consoles with AMD Z2 Series Processors\n4 hours ago\nGears Of War: Reloaded Announced and Expected to Release August 26th\n15 hours ago\nMicrosoft Store to Get a Major Makeover, New Features and Improvements Coming Soon\n18 hours ago\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy XVI Announced for Xbox\n19 hours ago\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 Announced with Trailer, Available on Game Pass at Launch\n2 days ago\nIO Interactive is Working on a Cooperative Mode for Hitman: World of Assassination\n2 days ago\nIntel Releases New Arc Graphics Driver 32.0.101.6877 Beta to Fix Audio Issues in Portable Consoles\n2 days ago\nNintendo Switch 2 May Have Already Set a Sales Record\n3 days ago\nBorderlands 2 Accused of Spying on Your Computer, Now Has \u2018Extremely Negative\u2019 Reviews\n3 days ago\nRAZER Introduces the New Phantom Collection\n3 days ago\nBlack Myth: Wukong for Xbox Series X|S Gets Official Release Date in August 2025\n3 days ago\nNVIDIA Leads GPU Market in Q1 2025 with 92% Share, AMD Drops to 8% and Intel at 0%\n3 days ago\nASUS Unleashes Prime MR120 Case Fans for Quiet and Colourful Cooling\n3 days ago\nSynology Unleashes the DS425+\n4 days ago\nIntel Integrated GPU Overclocked to 4.25 GHz, Beating GeForce RTX 4090 Record\n4 days ago\nElden Ring Nightreign Director Claims He Beat All Bosses Solo and Without Relics\n4 days ago\nNintendo Switch 2 Packaging Is So Thin That a Simple Staple Can Damage Its Screen\n4 days ago\nNintendo Switch 1 Games Perform Better on Switch 2 Even Without Updates\n4 days ago\nFirst Patch for The Elder Scrolls IV Remaster Released\nNewsletter Coming Soon!\nRelated Articles\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 Desktop Rumored to Launch in July\n4 days ago\nTSMC Achieves 90% Yield in 2nm Memory Chip Production\n4 days ago\nIntel Unveils Future CPU Plans; Wildcat Lake and Nova Lake at the Core of New Roadmap\n4 days ago\nPublishers Are Apparently \u201cThanking Nintendo\u201d for Game-Key Cards on Switch 2\n4 days ago\nLeave A Comment\nCheck Also\nClose\nPublishers Are Apparently \u201cThanking Nintendo\u201d for Game-Key Cards on Switch 2\n4 days ago\nDigital Foundry Confirms Witcher 4 Tech Demo Ran on Standard PS5, But Final Game May Differ\n5 days ago\nShare via Email\nPrint\nWhatsApp\nTelegram\nBack to top button\nClose\nClose\nClose\nAdblock Detected\nPlease consider supporting us by disabling your ad blocker!

"https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/thailand-and-cambodia-border-dispute-leads-to-new-closure-of-border-crossings-stranding-thousands-of-tourists/", "content": "Thailand has closed two of its border crossings to tourists as a precautionary measure, citing ongoing tensions with its neighboring country, Cambodia. This decision has left thousands of travelers stranded at the border, disrupting travel plans and raising concerns about the impact on tourism. The decision to shut down these entry points came after a deadly military skirmish on May 28, 2025, which saw the tragic death of a Cambodian soldier in the Emerald Triangle, a region where the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos converge.\nThe Trigger: Military Skirmish in the Emerald Triangle\nThe military clash that led to the closure of the border occurred on May 28, when tensions flared between Thai and Cambodian troops in the disputed area of the Emerald Triangle. The skirmish resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier, further exacerbating the already fragile situation between the two nations. This incident marked the latest chapter in a long history of border disputes between Thailand and Cambodia, which has been marked by sporadic violence and ongoing territorial disagreements.\nThe Emerald Triangle, located in the border region where Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos meet, has long been a hotspot for tensions between the neighboring countries. This area is not only of strategic military significance but also a point of economic importance due to its proximity to major trade routes and resources. The conflict over this region has been ongoing since 2008, leading to clashes that have claimed at least 28 lives over the years.\nThe Agreement to Reposition Troops\nIn the wake of the violence, Thailand and Cambodia reached an agreement to reposition their military forces in the disputed border area. Both countries emphasized the importance of de-escalating tensions to prevent further confrontations. Influential figures such as former Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen have stressed the need for \u201cmutual understanding\u201d in adjusting military forces, calling it essential to avoid large-scale violent clashes.\nThis diplomatic agreement aims to reduce the likelihood of further violent incidents in the region by ensuring that both nations\u2019 military forces are positioned in a way that minimizes potential conflict. The move is seen as a step toward stabilizing the situation and restoring peace to the long-disputed border area.\nHistorical Context of the Border Dispute\nThe tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over the border are rooted in a complex historical context. The dispute centers around the demarcation of their shared border, which was largely defined during the French colonial period in Indochina. The French occupation of the region created several ambiguities in the borderlines, leaving both countries with conflicting territorial claims.\nThe most well-known and contentious area in the dispute is the land surrounding the Preah Vihear Temple, a Hindu temple located on a cliff in the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak Mountains. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in 1962 that the temple belonged to Cambodia, but Thailand has disputed this ruling, leading to tensions and violence over the years. Both nations have engaged in diplomatic talks and military stand-offs over the decades, with the border dispute flaring up at various points since 2008.\nCambodia\u2019s current Prime Minister, Hun Manet, has recently voiced his government\u2019s intentions to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in an effort to resolve the ongoing border dispute. He has stated that Cambodia will file a formal complaint against Thailand regarding the border issue, seeking international intervention to resolve the dispute once and for all.\nImpact on Tourism and Cross-Border Travel\nThe unexpected closure of the two border crossings has had a significant impact on travelers, with thousands of people left stranded in both countries. The closure came at a time when tourism was recovering from the pandemic and cross-border travel had been increasing. For many, the closure was an unwelcome disruption to their travel plans, particularly for those who had intended to visit Thailand or Cambodia as part of multi-country tours in Southeast Asia.\nThe tourism industry in both countries, already facing challenges from the pandemic, is now grappling with the impact of these border closures. While domestic tourism has been on the rise in both Thailand and Cambodia, the closure of these key entry points has been a setback for international tourism, particularly for those looking to visit from neighboring countries.\nTourism authorities in both countries have expressed concerns over the economic impact of the border shutdown, as both Thailand and Cambodia rely heavily on tourism revenue. Thailand, one of the world\u2019s most visited countries, and Cambodia, home to major tourist attractions such as Angkor Wat, are both heavily dependent on international visitors for economic growth. The disruption caused by the border closure has raised questions about how the two countries will manage the situation in the coming weeks and months.\nThe Broader Geopolitical Context\nThe border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not only a bilateral issue but also has implications for the broader geopolitical landscape in Southeast Asia. The region has seen increasing attention from global powers in recent years, with countries like China, the United States, and other regional actors closely monitoring the situation. The tensions between Thailand and Cambodia could have ripple effects throughout the region, especially as both countries have strategic interests that align with different global powers.\nThe relationship between Thailand and Cambodia has fluctuated over the years, with both countries engaging in dialogue and cooperation while also experiencing periods of heightened tension. The military conflict and the closure of border crossings serve as a reminder of the challenges that persist in Southeast Asia, where territorial disputes and historical grievances continue to shape the relationships between neighboring countries.\nPotential Paths Toward Resolution\nWhile the closure of the border crossings has led to significant disruptions, there is hope that diplomatic efforts can prevent further escalation. The agreement to reposition troops in the disputed border area is a step in the right direction, but the situation remains fragile. Both Thailand and Cambodia must continue to engage in dialogue and seek peaceful resolutions to their territorial disputes.\nThe role of international organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice, may become more critical in facilitating negotiations and ensuring that both countries adhere to international norms and agreements. The ICJ, in particular, could play a crucial role in resolving the border dispute and providing a neutral platform for both sides to reach a fair and lasting solution.\nPublic Reactions and Regional Cooperation\nPublic reaction in both Thailand and Cambodia has been mixed, with some calling for a more aggressive stance, while others urge calm and diplomacy. Civil society organizations in both countries have called for greater transparency and dialogue to ensure that the conflict does not escalate into full-scale violence.\nAt the regional level, Southeast Asian nations are watching the situation closely, as stability in the region is vital for economic development and security. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which both Thailand and Cambodia are members, has an important role to play in fostering dialogue and promoting peaceful resolutions to disputes in the region.\nASEAN has long advocated for peaceful conflict resolution and cooperation among its member states. The ongoing Thailand-Cambodia border dispute presents a test of ASEAN\u2019s ability to address regional tensions effectively. Moving forward, the organization may need to take a more active role in facilitating discussions and ensuring that both countries adhere to the principles of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.\nConclusion\nThe unexpected closure of two border crossings between Thailand and Cambodia has left thousands of travelers stranded and created uncertainty for the tourism sectors in both countries. While the immediate impact is significant, the situation also presents an opportunity for both nations to engage in further diplomatic dialogue and work toward a peaceful resolution of the long-standing border dispute.\nAs both countries move forward with repositioning their troops and addressing the immediate aftermath of the skirmish, the hope is that tensions will de-escalate and that tourism can resume. The international community, particularly through organizations like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice, will likely play a crucial role in helping resolve the dispute and promoting lasting peace in the region.\nFor now, travelers and tourism authorities in Thailand and Cambodia will be closely monitoring the situation, hoping for a swift resolution that will allow for the restoration of cross-border travel and the continued growth of the Southeast Asian tourism market.\nThe post\nThailand and Cambodia Border Dispute Leads to New Closure of Border Crossings, Stranding Thousands of Tourists\nappeared first on\nTravel And Tour World\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Border crossings closed to tourists|Military skirmish led to closure|Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia|Agreement to reposition troops|Hun Manet intends to take matter to ICJ;E:Border closure impacting tourism|Military clash on May 28, 2025|Disruption of travel plans|Violence in Emerald Triangle|ICJ ruled Preah Vihear Temple belongs to Cambodia;D:Thousands of travelers stranded|28 lives lost in past clashes|Emerald Triangle hotspot|Dispute ongoing since 2008|Tourism revenue impacted;", "er_digest": "N:Hun Manet|Travel And Tour World|Hun Sen;R:Cambodia|Thailand|Laos|Emerald Triangle;", "gist": "P:Border crossings closed to tourists|Military skirmish led to closure|Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia|Agreement to reposition troops|Hun Manet intends to take matter to ICJ;E:Border closure impacting tourism|Military clash on May 28, 2025|Disruption of travel plans|Violence in Emerald Triangle|ICJ ruled Preah Vihear Temple belongs to Cambodia;D:Thousands of travelers stranded|28 lives lost in past clashes|Emerald Triangle hotspot|Dispute ongoing since 2008|Tourism revenue impacted;N:Hun Manet|Travel And Tour World|Hun Sen;R:Cambodia|Thailand|Laos|Emerald Triangle;", "entities": ["Hun Manet", "Travel And Tour World", "Hun Sen"], "regions": ["Cambodia", "Thailand", "Laos", "Emerald Triangle"]}, {"_id": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/tourism-malaysia-targets-chinese-market-with-bold-promotional-plans-at-itb-china/", "content": "At ITB China 2025, we sat down with Nuwal Fadhilah Ku Azmi, the Senior Director of the International Promotion Division at Tourism Malaysia, to discuss the country\u2019s ambitious strategies for attracting Chinese travelers and its upcoming Visit Malaysia 2026 campaign. As Malaysia prepares for an influx of visitors, particularly from China, Ms. Azmi shared insights on how Malaysia is positioning itself as a top destination for adventurous travelers, while also focusing on sustainability and cultural preservation.\nHow\u2019s the day going so far at ITB China?\nThe day has been fantastic! We\u2019re in the final stretch of ITB China, and I must say, it\u2019s been a very productive event. Our\nsellers\nare still having meetings and appointments, and there are plenty of cultural activities happening. As\nMalaysia\nis the official\npartner destination\nthis year, we\u2019re making sure that we maximize our exposure and meet potential partners, both new and existing. It\u2019s been a great platform to connect with the\nChinese market\nand raise awareness for\nVisit Malaysia 2026\n.\nAs the official partner destination at ITB China, what are Malaysia\u2019s key objectives for this year\u2019s event?\nChina\nis one of the most important markets for\nMalaysia\nin terms of\ntourism\n. Last year, we welcomed over\n4.5 million Chinese visitors\n, and this year we expect even more interest. Our goal at\nITB China\nis not just to promote\nMalaysia\nas a destination, but also to ensure that\nVisit Malaysia 2026\ngets off to a strong start. We want to make a\nbig impact\nhere, so our\nnational sellers\n, who focus on the\nChinese market\n, can connect with key partners and generate immediate business. It\u2019s also an opportunity to promote\nMalaysia\nthrough the media and let everyone know about the upcoming\nVisit Malaysia 2026\ncampaign. We want travelers to know that\nMalaysia\nis ready to welcome them and provide a\nunique travel experience\n.\nHow is Malaysia gearing up for the Visit Malaysia 2026 campaign, and how does ITB China fit into your global promotional strategy?\nThe\nVisit Malaysia 2026\ncampaign is a\nnational agenda\n, and we have the support of all relevant\nministries\nand\nindustry players\n.\nITB China\nis an integral part of our global promotional strategy because it gives us direct access to the\nChinese market\n, which is key to our tourism growth. We are looking to\nexpand our network\n, build new relationships, and raise\nawareness\nabout\nMalaysia\nas a\ntop travel destination\n. The\nITB China\nplatform allows us to connect with Chinese tourists and also helps\nboost Malaysia\u2019s visibility\nin\nAsia\nand\nglobally\n.\nWhat new campaigns or travel experiences are being introduced to attract more Chinese travelers to Malaysia?\nWe have a new campaign theme for\nVisit Malaysia 2026\n:\n\u201cSurreal Experiences.\u201d\nWe want\nChinese travelers\nto discover the variety of experiences that\nMalaysia\noffers\u2014our\nrich cultural diversity\n, beautiful landscapes, and\nunique cuisine\n. Malaysia is truly a melting pot of\nChinese\n,\nIndian\n, and\nindigenous cultures\n.\nFor\nChinese tourists\n, we\u2019re emphasizing experiences in\ngastronomy\n,\nfestivals\n, and cultural activities.

We aim to make\nMalaysia\na prominent choice on the\nChinese market\u2019s radar\n.\nHow is Malaysia positioning itself in the post-pandemic tourism landscape to rebuild confidence and boost arrivals from China?\nMalaysia is in a strong position to attract\nChinese tourists\n, especially after the\nvisa-free policy\nbetween\nChina\nand\nMalaysia\nwas introduced. This change has made it easier for\nChinese nationals\nto travel to\nMalaysia\n, as they no longer need a visa to visit. The\nvisa-free policy\nhas had a\npositive effect\non travel patterns, with\nlast-minute bookings\nbecoming more common, especially for short\ngetaway tours\n.\nChina has been a significant market for\nMalaysia\n, and the\nbilateral relationship\nbetween the two countries, which has lasted over\n50 years\n, strengthens the connection. The policy shift reflects the ongoing\npositive trends\nin\nChina-Malaysia relations\n, and many\nChinese tourists\nare now more comfortable visiting Malaysia. The\nshort getaway trend\nis particularly important for Chinese travelers, as they look for\nquick trips\nto nearby destinations without the lengthy visa application process.\nHow are you responding to the demand for more adventurous travel experiences among Chinese tourists?\nWe\u2019re seeing that\nChinese tourists\nare becoming more adventurous. In the past, they often traveled in large groups, but now, they\u2019re opting for more\ncustomized travel experiences\n. We\u2019ve noticed a rising interest in\nsmaller, more intimate tours\n. These travelers want to explore\nnew places\n, enjoy\nlocal experiences\n, and try different kinds of\nadventure tourism\n. Malaysia offers\ntropical rainforests\n,\ndiving destinations\n,\nhiking trails\n, and\nisland getaways\n, all of which attract this growing market segment.\nMalaysia\nhas become an easy and comfortable destination for\nChinese tourists\n, as they feel familiar with the\nChinese culture\nin the country. However, they\u2019re also drawn to\nMalaysia\u2019s diversity\n, offering them a chance to explore\nmultiple cultures\nand cuisines in one destination.\nSmaller groups\nand\ntailor-made itineraries\nare becoming more popular, allowing travelers to experience\nMalaysia\u2019s unique offerings\nat their own pace.\nHow is sustainable tourism influencing Malaysia\u2019s development plans, especially in balancing growth with cultural and environmental preservation?\nSustainability\nis at the heart of\nMalaysia\u2019s tourism development plans\n.\nMalaysia\ntakes pride in its\nrainforest coverage\nand\nnatural attractions\n, including its\nbeaches\nand\nislands\n. However, the government and tourism authorities are working to balance\ntourism growth\nwith\nenvironmental preservation\n.\nOne key example is the\nSipadan Island\n, which has a strict\ncarrying capacity\nfor divers. This helps maintain the\nintegrity\nof the island\u2019s environment while providing a\nhigh-quality experience\nfor\ntourists\n. Similarly,\nMount Kinabalu\nhas a\nlimited number of climbers\nallowed per day to ensure\nenvironmental sustainability\n.\nIn line with the\nVisit Malaysia 2026\ncampaign,\nMalaysia\nis positioning itself as a\nsustainable tourism destination\nthat emphasizes the preservation of its\nnatural beauty\nand\nrich culture\n.\nSustainable tourism\nwill continue to be a priority as the country moves forward with\ntourism development\n, ensuring that\nfuture generations\ncan continue to enjoy\nMalaysia\u2019s unique natural resources\n.\nAny final words for our audience, especially Chinese travelers, about why they should visit Malaysia?\nWe invite all travelers, especially those from\nChina\n, to visit\nMalaysia\nfor\nVisit Malaysia 2026\n.

The 1971 album\nThere\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On\n, a moody reflection on civil rights and the corrupted idealism of the postwar era created predominantly by Stone apart from the rest of his band, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of the 20th century.\nBorn Sylvester Stewart to a Pentecostal religious family in Texas in 1943, Stone grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. His first music came in a gospel quartet with three siblings, the Stewart Four, who put out a locally released single in 1952.\nAs a young man he became well known in the fertile musical scene of countercultural San Francisco: a multi-instrumentalist and radio DJ who had a series of local bands and worked as a producer for garage rock and psychedelia groups such as the Beau Brummels.\nIn 1966, he fused his band Sly and the Stoners with his brother Freddie\u2019s group Freddie and the Stone Souls, to form Sly and the Family Stone. Their breakthrough came the following year with Dance to the Music, and success was fully established by their fourth album in two years,\nStand! (1969)\n, which eventually sold more than three million copies. The band\u2019s stylistic and racial diversity attracted a broad audience, and they played both of the defining music festivals of 1969, Woodstock and the Harlem cultural festival.\nHits continued more fitfully during the early 1970s, and the group \u2013 notorious for no-shows at concerts \u2013 slowly fractured amid increasing drug use. Stone would record There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On predominantly on his own, applying one of the earliest uses of a drum machine; albums such as Fresh!, with its Richard Avedon portrait of Stone on the cover, were also primarily his work. The band split entirely in 1975, though Stone continued to use the band name for solo releases.\nDespite having laid the rhythmic groundwork for disco, Stone couldn\u2019t sustain his career in the late 1970s, and his addiction to cocaine worsened. He continued to perform with peers such as Funkadelic and Bobby Womack, but album releases dried up after 1982\u2019s Ain\u2019t But the One Way.\nHe was arrested in 1983 for cocaine possession, and for driving under the influence of cocaine in 1987, prompting him to flee California for Connecticut. He was apprehended two years later, and sentenced to 55 days in prison, five years\u2019 probation and a fine. His difficulties meant that he was little seen during the 1990s, and it wasn\u2019t until 2006 that he performed in public again, at a tribute to Sly and the Family Stone at the Grammy awards.\nHe performed with the Family Stone on a tour the following year, but often erratically, and made a lacklustre appearance at 2010\u2019s Coachella festival. His final album, I\u2019m Back! Family & Friends, featuring re-recordings of old songs alongside three new tracks, was released in 2011.\nIn 2015\nhe was awarded $5m\nin a lawsuit against his former manager and attorney, successfully arguing that royalty payments had been diverted from him, though he ultimately wasn\u2019t awarded the money due to the terms of a 1989 royalties agreement with a production company. Difficulties with royalties meant that Stone spent many of his latter years in poverty; in 2011 he was living in a campervan in a residential area of Los Angeles \u2013 voluntarily, he claimed \u2013 and relying on a retired couple for food.\n\u201cSly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,\u201d the family statement added. \u201cHis iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable. In a testament to his enduring creative spirit, Sly recently completed the screenplay for his life story, a project we are eager to share with the world in due course, which follows a memoir published in 2024.\u201d\nThat memoir, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), was praised in a Guardian review: \u201cThe charm, playfulness, humour and personality of Stone\u2019s songs come through in his on-page voice\u201d.\nIn\na 2023 interview with the Guardian\naccompanying its publication, he said: \u201cI was always happy if someone took the things I was doing and they liked them enough to want to do them on their own. I\u2019m proud that the music I made inspired people.\u201d\nAmong those paying tribute to Stone was musician and actor Queen Latifah, who heralded an \u201cinnovator [and] funk aficionado\u201d, and hip-hop icon DJ Premier who wrote: \u201cI thank you for bringing us diversity, funk, soul, rock and a unique band which is why I\u2019m cut from the integrity cloth. I will remain great because of you.\u201d Waterboys frontman Mike Scott wrote: \u201cThank you for all the inspiration, for breaking ground so others could follow and for being the sassiest, funkiest being on planet earth\u201d.\nStone was married from 1974 to 1976 to Kathy Silva, with whom he had a son, Sylvester Jr. He later had two further children: Sylvyette with\nCynthia Robinson\n, and Novena Carmel.\nExplore more on these topics\nSly Stone\nPop and rock\nSoul\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content\nMost viewed\nMost viewed", "ped_digest": "P:Death of Sly Stone|Pioneering funk and soul musician dies aged 82|Prolonged battle with COPD|Musical legacy will continue to inspire;E:Death|Family statement released|Group formed Sly and the Family Stone|Hits include Everyday People, Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), Family Affair|Album There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On released|Stewart Four released single in 1952|Sly and the Stoners fused with Freddie and the Stone Souls|Dance to the Music breakthrough|Stand! album sold over 3 million copies|Band played Woodstock and Harlem cultural festival|Group fractured due to drug use|There\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On predominantly Stone\u2019s work|Fresh! album released|Band split in 1975|Arrested for cocaine possession and DUI|Fled California for Connecticut|Sentenced to prison and probation|Performed at Grammy tribute in 2006|Performed on Family Stone tour in 2007|Appeared at Coachella festival in 2010|I\u2019m Back!

While conducting material testing for a high-pressure, high-temperature supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO\n2\n) turbine, SwRI achieved unprecedented conditions of 1,150 degrees Celsius (2,100 degrees Fahrenheit) at 300 bar (4,350 psi). These are the highest published temperature and pressure conditions ever reached in sCO\n2\nmaterials testing.\nIn 2020, SwRI received a $6.4 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy to design an sCO\n2\noxy-fuel turbine for a direct-fired sCO\n2\npower plant. The project, led by Senior Research Engineer Michael Marshall and Institute Engineer Dr. Jeff Moore, required materials testing in extreme sCO\n2\nenvironments.\n\u201cWe evaluated turbine materials at constant temperatures and pressures with 100% sCO\n2\n. We assessed the performance of different materials and coatings under extreme conditions,\u201d said SwRI\u2019s Dr. Florent Bocher, who oversaw materials engineering for the project.\nPreviously, the highest pressure and temperature conditions reached for supercritical CO\n2\nreported in the literature were 800 degrees Celsius at 300 bar, which SwRI aimed to exceed by 350 degrees. SwRI\u2019s oxy-fuel turbine was designed to operate at a maximum temperature of 1,150 degrees.\n\u201cDuring initial testing, we aimed to build a test vessel to evaluate materials at the highest temperatures and pressures based on the turbine design, which was 1,150 degrees Celsius at 300 bar,\u201d Bocher said. \u201cHowever, the mechanical properties of the vessel materials decline as temperatures rise. This makes it impossible to safely use a traditional high-pressure and high-temperature experimental setup design, which incorporates external heating.\u201d\nTo overcome this limitation, SwRI modified an autoclave, a specialized device designed to contain a high-pressure and high-temperature test environment. The researchers installed an induction coil inside the autoclave, while its exterior was actively cooled. This allows the external containment structure to stay relatively cool and hold the pressure safely while the inside of the vessel reaches the targeted high temperatures.\n\u201cThe new setup allows us to reach up to 1,150 degrees Celsius at 300 bar, significantly enhancing our capability to conduct tests under extreme conditions,\u201d Bocher said. \u201cThis advancement provides additional opportunities to support testing of other types of turbine materials.\u201d\nThis unique capability can also test materials employed in other extreme applications, such as molten salt energy production and storage, hypersonics research and additional material testing for the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) Demo pilot plant, a $170 million, 10-megawatt supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO\n2\n) demonstration facility at SwRI.\n\u201cThis is a major accomplishment. SwRI\u2019s superior capabilities push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in this field,\u201d Bocher said. \u201cThis new capability is crucial for both current and future research areas and technologies that demand extreme testing conditions.\u201d\nFor more information, visit\nMachinery\nor\nMaterials\nor contact\nJoanna Quintanilla\n,\n+1 210 522 2073\n, Communications Department, Southwest Research Institute, 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, TX 78238-5166.\n\u6b22\u8fce\nBienvenue\nWillkommen\n\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d\nBienvenidos", "ped_digest": "P:Record-breaking pressure and temperature achieved in sCO2 materials testing|Significant milestone in materials testing for high-pressure environments|Advancement enhances capability to conduct tests under extreme conditions|Unique capability supports testing of materials in other extreme applications|Crucial for current and future research areas and technologies demanding extreme testing conditions;E:SwRI achieved 1,150 degrees Celsius (2,100 degrees Fahrenheit) at 300 bar (4,350 psi) in sCO2 materials testing|SwRI received a $6.4 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2020|SwRI modified an autoclave with an induction coil and active cooling;D:$6.4 million contract|1,150 degrees Celsius (2,100 degrees Fahrenheit)|300 bar (4,350 psi)|10-megawatt|170 million;", "er_digest": "N:Dr. Jeff Moore|Joanna Quintanilla|Southwest Research Institute|Michael Marshall;R:Texas|United States|San Antonio;", "gist": "P:Record-breaking pressure and temperature achieved in sCO2 materials testing|Significant milestone in materials testing for high-pressure environments|Advancement enhances capability to conduct tests under extreme conditions|Unique capability supports testing of materials in other extreme applications|Crucial for current and future research areas and technologies demanding extreme testing conditions;E:SwRI achieved 1,150 degrees Celsius (2,100 degrees Fahrenheit) at 300 bar (4,350 psi) in sCO2 materials testing|SwRI received a $6.4 million contract from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2020|SwRI modified an autoclave with an induction coil and active cooling;D:$6.4 million contract|1,150 degrees Celsius (2,100 degrees Fahrenheit)|300 bar (4,350 psi)|10-megawatt|170 million;N:Dr. Jeff Moore|Joanna Quintanilla|Southwest Research Institute|Michael Marshall;R:Texas|United States|San Antonio;", "entities": ["Dr. Jeff Moore", "Joanna Quintanilla", "Southwest Research Institute", "Michael Marshall"], "regions": ["Texas", "United States", "San Antonio"]}, {"_id": "https://glassalmanac.com/faster-than-anything-ever-seen-mind-blowing-speed-of-quantum-entanglement-measured-for-the-first-time/", "content": "Skip to content\nFaster Than Anything Ever Seen : Mind-Blowing Speed of Quantum Entanglement Measured for the First Time\nJune 9, 2025\nJune 9, 2025\nReading time: About 3 minutes\nby\nBrian Foster\nShare this Post:\nWhatsApp\nShare\nIn a monumental breakthrough, scientists have measured the speed of quantum entanglement for the first time\u2014an achievement that is set to radically transform the way we understand the quantum world. For years, quantum entanglement was thought to be an instantaneous process, but this new research, published in Physical Review Letters, has pushed the boundaries of our knowledge, providing new insights into the quantum realm and setting the stage for revolutionary advances in data security and computational technologies.\nA New Era of Precision: Attosecond Measurements\nSubscribe to the Glass Almanac YouTube channel\nTo fully appreciate the magnitude of this discovery, it\u2019s important to understand just how precise the measurements are. Scientists used attosecond precision to track electron movements. To put it into perspective, light travels the width of a human hair in just one attosecond. This extreme level of precision allows researchers to observe quantum interactions at a scale that was previously unreachable, unlocking doors to new technological possibilities.\nThis innovation is not merely a scientific marvel; it lays the foundation for real-world applications such as faster, more secure\ndata transmission\n. By mastering the measurement of quantum interactions on such a small time scale, we open up opportunities for practical advancements in various fields.\nQuantum Entanglement: Connecting the Unimaginable\nQuantum entanglement is a concept that has captivated physicists for decades. It refers to the phenomenon where two particles become so intertwined that the state of one directly influences the state of the other\u2014regardless of the distance between them. This principle has been central to ideas like quantum teleportation and could potentially reshape communications and computing in the future.\nSee also\nChina\u2019s secret spaceplane caught on camera soaring over Europe\nIn this groundbreaking study, researchers led by\nProf. Joachim Burgd\u00f6rfer\nand\nProf. Iva B\u0159ezinov\u00e1\nused high-frequency lasers to entangle particles in a controlled environment. By ejecting an electron and entangling it with another, they revealed how quantum particles could interact in ways that defy traditional physical laws. According to Burgd\u00f6rfer, this study challenges our understanding of identity and individuality in the quantum world, suggesting that the rules of classical physics don\u2019t apply at the quantum level.\nMethods and Results: Zooming In on the Quantum World\nIn their quest to measure the speed of entanglement, the scientists employed advanced techniques such as attosecond streaking and the RABBIT method (reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions). These sophisticated techniques allowed them to accurately measure the zero time of photoionization\u2014a critical observation in understanding how quantum entanglement occurs.\nWhat\u2019s truly astonishing is that the electron entanglement took place over extremely brief time frames, with a difference of about 232 attoseconds between the interactions. This incredible precision not only sheds light on the nature of quantum entanglement but also sets a new standard in experimental quantum physics. By resolving these time scales, the research offers potential for future quantum technologies and methods for manipulating entangled states.\nSubscribe to the Glass Almanac YouTube channel\nWhat\u2019s Next: The Future of Quantum Technologies\nThe implications of this discovery are enormous. By gaining a better understanding of how quantum entanglement operates, scientists can unlock new methods of quantum encryption, which could potentially render data transmission virtually impenetrable to hacking. As Prof. Iva B\u0159ezinov\u00e1 notes, understanding how entanglement initiates could be a critical step in revolutionizing\ndata security\nand other quantum-based technologies.\nSee also\nHe spent 32 000 dollars on a PC with 1 000 GB RAM not even for gaming\nThe study also opens up new avenues for computing, telecommunications, and beyond. If quantum entanglement can be controlled and harnessed efficiently, it could lead to a whole new class of quantum computers that operate at speeds previously thought impossible. These developments promise not just faster processing, but also a new era of computational capabilities that could impact everything from\nartificial intelligence\nto scientific simulations.\nA Quantum Leap Towards the Future\nWhile this discovery marks an exciting step forward, the journey is far from over. Scientists are already planning to dive deeper into quantum mechanics, further exploring how these entangled states can be manipulated for practical applications. The world of attosecond physics is still in its infancy, but this research brings us one step closer to unlocking the full potential of quantum technology.\nAs researchers continue to probe the mysteries of quantum entanglement, the future of quantum warfare, secure communications, and even global networks is brimming with possibilities. The race to control and apply these quantum principles is just beginning, and the next few decades could see radical transformations in our approach to data security, computation, and technological innovation.\nIn the grand scheme of things, this discovery could turn out to be a defining moment in the history of technology. As we look ahead, the impact of quantum science will likely shape the way we live, work, and communicate in the years to come. The future of computing and security seems brighter\u2014and faster\u2014than ever before.\nSimilar Posts\nInstantaneity measured at 232 attoseconds\nQuantum Entanglement Observed at Incredibly Tiny Scales!\nWhat Are Electrons Made Of?

Keeping NIH at the forefront of biomedical research requires our stalwart commitment to continuous improvement. But the life-and-death nature of our work demands that changes be thoughtful and vetted. We are compelled to speak up when our leadership\nprioritizes political momentum\nover\nhuman safety\nand\nfaithful stewardship of public resources\n.\nMany have raised these concerns to NIH leadership, yet we remain pressured to implement harmful measures. Today, we come directly to you. We include Secretary Kennedy and members of Congress who oversee NIH. We look forward to working with you and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leadership to maintain NIH as the world leader of biomedical research.\nOur Shared Commitment to Academic Freedom\nAcademic freedom is a core scientific principle, and we deeply appreciate your public commitment to it at your confirmation hearing, in your\nApril 24 statement on academic freedom\n,\nand in\nrecent media interviews\n. You said: \"I will establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH,\" \"Dissent is the very essence of science,\" and \"...dissenting voices need to be heard and allowed.\" We hope you will welcome this dissent, which we modeled after your Great Barrington Declaration.\nOur Concerns\nThis Administration has forced NIH, under your watch, to\n:\n1) Politicize research by halting high-quality, peer reviewed grants and contracts.\nAcademic freedom should not be applied selectively based on political ideology. To achieve political aims, NIH has targeted multiple universities with indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science. Based on political preferences and without input from NIH scientific staff or Congress, NIH is censoring critical research and programs addressing:\nHealth disparities.\nU.S. Law (\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 282\n) states that NIH\nshall\n\"utilize diverse study populations, with special consideration to biological, social, and other determinants of health that contribute to health disparities.\" Yet, NIH has\nstigmatized and abruptly cut off funding\nfor research mislabeled \"Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI).\" Achieving your stated goal to \"solve the American chronic disease crisis\u201d requires\nresearch addressing the social and structural drivers of health disparities\n.\nCOVID-19, long COVID, and immunization.\nWe still have much to learn about the health and social consequences of COVID-19 and our response. Such research is needed to reduce the risk of future pandemics, optimize pandemic response policies, and address the well-documented and\ndebilitating consequences\nof long COVID.\nHealth impacts of climate change.\nSubstantial evidence\nshows human-driven climate change leads to higher rates of disease and death, such as\nasthma\n,\nheart disease\n, and\nstillbirths\n. Research is critical to find effective ways to reduce these and other health impacts of climate change.\nGender identity, sexual health, and the needs of\nintersex people\nin the U.S.\nThese topics deserve research attention, and NIH has a long tradition of supporting rigorous research in these fields.\nBroad participation in biomedical research.\nRobust research shows\ndiverse teams outperform homogeneous ones\n. A broad workforce strengthens research capacity and supports globally competitive science. Due to misunderstanding of its workforce diversity programs, NIH terminated top-scoring grants to scientists from underrepresented backgrounds, while maintaining poorer-scoring grants from standard pathways, contrary to the merit-based system that makes NIH a global research leader.\nSince January 20, 2025, NIH has terminated\n2,100 research grants totaling around $9.5 billion\nand\n$2.6 billion in contracts\n. This undercuts\nlong-standing NIH policies\ndesigned to maximize return on investment by working with grantees to address concerns and complete studies. Many terminations contradict federal regulations that\nmandate protections for research participants\nand\nrequire grant awards to specify potential termination reasons\n. These terminations:\nThrow away years of hard work and millions of dollars\n. Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million, it wastes $4 million.\nShirk commitments to participants\n, who braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\nRisk participant health.\nNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\n, abruptly stopping medications or leaving participants with unmonitored device implants.\nDamage hard-earned public trust\n, counter to your stated goal to improve trust in NIH.\nWe urge you as NIH Director to restore grants delayed or terminated for political reasons so that life-saving science can continue.\n2) Interrupt global collaboration.\nWe would gladly work with you to improve existing systems to monitor awards with foreign components. But dissolving foreign collaborations while we await new procedures harms research participants and slows scientific discovery, cutting American scientists off from the global scientific community, preventing access to technologies only available abroad, and eliminating critical research that crosses political borders.\nWe urge you as NIH Director to allow rigorously peer-reviewed research with vetted foreign collaborators to continue without disruption.\n3) Undermine peer review.\nIndependent peer review is the bedrock of NIH science,\ndirecting scarce resources toward the most impactful research and ensuring credible findings that can lead to better health\n. Without independent peer review, we risk losing scientific integrity and public trust. NIH is ignoring peer review to cater to political whims, pulling applications prior to review and removing high-scoring grants from funding consideration. HHS has redirected this funding to unvetted projects, like the\nTaubenberger-Memoli vaccine project\n.\nWe urge you as NIH Director to restore peer review and hold political appointees to the same standards as other scientists.\n4) Enact a blanket 15% cap on indirect costs.\nUntil recently, indirect costs were negotiated using well-established criteria, accounting for critical research needs and\nvery real costs\n, such as buildings, animal facilities, computers, libraries, and administrative support. The arbitrary 15% cap would\nhinder research\n, risk viability of universities and hospitals\nin states across the country\n, force universities to\nrescind graduate student positions\n, limit undergraduate research training, and damage the incredibly successful NIH-university partnerships that have improved health through scientific advances.\nWe urge you as NIH Director to continue indirect rates that account for the research costs borne by academic institutions.\n5) Fire essential NIH staff.\nThe cuts to talented, hardworking professionals and critical departments\nwithout thought to their purpose or need\nhas slowed the pace of science, held up extramural grant and contract funding, made NIH less transparent and efficient, and\nput Clinical Center patients at risk\n.\nWe urge you as NIH Director to reinstate the people who make NIH work.\nDelivering on your duty to obligate NIH funds\nCombined, these actions have resulted in an\nunprecedented reduction in NIH spending\nthat\ndoes no\nt reflect efficiency but rather a dramatic reduction in life-saving research. Some may use the false impression that NIH funding is not needed\nto justify the draconian cuts proposed in the President's Budget\n. This spending slowdown reflects a failure of your legal duty to use congressionally-appropriated funds for critical NIH research. Each day that NIH continues to disrupt research, your ability to deliver on this duty narrows.\nWho We Are\nWe are workers from every Institute and Center at NIH. We are devoted to the\nNIH mission\n: to seek and apply fundamental knowledge \"to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.\" We share your stated goal of supporting impactful research that, as you said at your\nconfirmation hearing\n, is \"vital to our country's future and, indeed, the world's.\" We work hard every day to carefully steward public funds to drive impactful, cutting-edge research.

Together, we stand up for science.\nClick here to read the Open letter in support of the Bethesda Declaration.\nThe mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to \u201cseek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.\u201d\nIn public comments, NIH Director, Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya, has recognized the critical nature of this mission and has described the NIH as the \u201ccrown jewel of American biomedical science\u201d.\nUnfortunately, many of the actions of the current administration are inconsistent with this mission and statement. These actions undermine the unique and productive partnership between the federal government and universities, academic medical centers, and research institutes that has served the American people well over many decades. They are damaging the hard-earned trust between the NIH, academia, and the public that is essential for long-term progress.\nWe commend the NIH staff who have come forward with the \u201cBethesda Declaration\u201d to share concerns in the spirit of academic freedom, for the good of all. We stand with these committed professionals in support of reversing the harmful actions of this administration. We urge NIH and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leadership to work with NIH staff to return the NIH to its mission and to abandon the strategy of using NIH as a tool for achieving political goals unrelated to that mission.\nAs has been done historically, decisions and monitoring of applications and grants should be conducted by scientifically trained NIH staff through well-established processes including rigorous peer review. Such decisions must not be made by anonymous individuals outside of NIH.\nLike any large organization, NIH would benefit periodic review and strategic reforms. However, any reforms should be developed in partnership with NIH staff and other stakeholders through careful and thoughtful analysis. They should not occur through arbitrary changes with no clear purpose or benefits, and without careful consideration of potential risks and adverse consequences\u2014especially to the research participants who have entrusted NIH and its partners with their health.\nThe current endeavor to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) refers to some undefined time in the past. Since 1960, the death rate due to heart disease has been cut in half, going from 560 deaths per 100,000 people to approximately 230 deaths per 100,000 today. From 1960 to the present day, the five-year survival rate for childhood leukemia has increased nearly 10-fold, to over 90% for some forms. In 1960, the rate of measles infection was approximately 250 cases per 100,000 people compared with a near zero rate now (at least until recently). These are but a few of many examples. Certainly, much work remains to better treat disease and improve the health of Americans, such as addressing increased rates of obesity, diabetes, and opioid dependency. But, glamorizing a mythical past, while ignoring important progress made through biomedical research, does not enhance the health of American people.\nBefore the mid-1960s, many of the advances that were ushering in a new era in biology were coming from Europe. However, with support from the NIH, the contributions of American scientists grew over the next decades and America became the internationally recognized hub for biomedical research and training. This, combined with the American entrepreneurial spirit, led to the creation of the biotechnology industry. America was an important partner in the successful international project to sequence the human genome in its entirety and to characterize many variations that contribute to health and disease susceptibility. These advances, and associated technologies, have provided profound insights into the mechanisms of many diseases, both common and rare, that are yielding opportunities for real progress to advance human health, some of which have been realized.\nNow is the time to push forward the NIH mission and all that has been built to support it, not to disable it. We urge NIH and HHS leadership to work in partnership with the NIH staff members who have spoken out to refocus on this goal using time-tested processes to award and sustain support for the range of activities that drives the NIH mission, now and into the future.\nJoin the 6,838 of us in adding your name to the support letter!\nCurrent Signatories\n**1.8k signers who chose to keep their information private\nRoger Kornberg, PhD, Nobel laureate 200\n6\nfor elucidating the mechanism of DNA transcription\nCarolyn Bertozzi, PhD, Nobel laureate 2022 for developing chemical tools for studying living organisms\nMartin Chalfie, PhD, Nobel laureate 2008 for the development of green fluorescent protein\nJoachim Frank, PhD, Nobel laureate 2017 for the development of single particle cryo-electron microscopy\nMoungi Bawendi, PhD, Nobel laureate 2023 for the development of quantum dots\nVictor Ambros, PhD, Nobel laureate 2024 for the discovery of microRNA\nDrew Weissman, MD, PhD, Nobel laureate 2023 for discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective vaccines\nArdem Patapoutian, PhD, Nobel laureate 2021 for the discovery of receptors for touch\nAziz Sancar, PhD, Nobel laureate 2015 for elucidation of DNA repair mechanisms\nGregg Semenza, MD, PhD, Nobel laureate 2019 for discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability\nJack Szostak, PhD, Nobel laureate 2009 for discoveries about the function of telomeres and the telomerase enzyme\nCarol Greider, PhD, Nobel laureate 2009 for discoveries about the function of telomeres and the telomerase enzyme\nAndrew Fire, PhD, Nobel laureate 2006 for the discovery of RNA interference\nRobert Horvitz, PhD, Nobel laureate 2002 for the discovery of programmed cell death\nDavid Baker, PhD, Nobel laureate 2024 for protein structure prediction and design\nW.E.

School\nTJ\u2019s story throws stark light on the problems with building admissions policies around racial \u201cequity.\u201d\nCredit: John M. Chase/Shutterstock\nThe results are in for at least one school: After four years of DEI-driven, functionally race-based admissions, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, known as TJ, in Alexandria, Virginia, has seen its national ranking fall to 14th place and its number of National Merit Scholar semifinalists cut nearly in half.\nAnd according to the Virginia Attorney General, as of May 2025 it is in\nviolation\nof the Virginia Human Rights Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for discriminating against Asian American students in the admissions process at the school. TJ is also under federal investigation. It is steadfastly sticking to its radical admissions policy despite the negative effects. Given T.J.\u2019s role as a STEM feeder school into the Ivies and Big Tech, this is more than another culture war battle. It affects national security.\nUntil four years ago the only way into TJ was via a rigorous entrance exam. Then in 2020, following the death of George Floyd, TJ officials became concerned about their negligible number of black and Hispanic students and changed admissions standards. The test was gone,\nreplaced\nby a \u201cholistic review\u201d to include more \u201cstudents who are economically disadvantaged [who now make up over\n11\npercent of the student body] English language learners, special education students, or students who are currently attending underrepresented middle schools.\u201d\nWithout the entrance test, the black student population grew to seven percent from one percent of the class, while the number of Asian American students fell from 73 to 54 percent, the lowest share in years. A group of mostly Asian American parents objected to the new plan and started the Coalition for TJ. The coalition filed a lawsuit with the help of the\nlibertarian\nPacific Legal Foundation\n. Instead of seeing weighting of experience factors as a way to level the playing field for underrepresented groups, they saw racism. The experience factors were just a work-around for straight up race-based decisions.\nIn 2022, a federal judge\nfound\nthe school board engaged in impermissible \u201cracial balancing\u201d when it overhauled admissions. In May 2023, however, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in favor of the new admissions process, finding TJ had not discriminated against Asian American students in its admissions policies. The appellate court found that there was\nnot\nsufficient evidence the changes were adopted with discriminatory intent. The court said that the school had a legitimate interest in \u201cexpanding the array of student backgrounds.\u201d\nToo bad for the Asians, America\u2019s on-and-off minority; there are only so many seats available at TJ. The court found TJ\u2019s essay-based admission policy was not a proxy for race-based decisions. TJ was thus able to make racially-motivated decisions without appearing legally to make racially-motivated decisions. Because of this twist of logic, Supreme Court decisions in key affirmative action cases,\nStudents for Fair Admissions Inc.\nv\n. President & Fellows of\nHarvard\nCollege\nand\nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc.\nv\n. University of\nNorth Carolina\n,\ndid not apply.\nThe Supreme Court then\ndeclined\ncertiorari\u2014\nit would not hear the case\u2014in\nCoalition for\nT.J.\nv\n. Fairfax County School Board\n. The conservative Court\u2019s denial left in place the\nruling\nby the U.S. Court of Appeals affirming the discriminatory policy. The declination is in contrast to the Court\u2019s earlier\nrejection\nof affirmative action,\nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc.\nv\n. Harvard\n, and of race as a primary admissions factor. TJ was free, for all intents and purposes, to discriminate in its admissions process.\nOne factor TJ would rely on was an applicant\u2019s public middle school zip code, a good indicator of race in a divided Fairfax County. Zip code was to become one proxy for race, a work-around to\nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc.\nv\n. Harvard\n,\nwhich supposedly outlawed race alone as a primary admissions factor. Schools like TJ may use race as an admissions criterion so long as it is not the\nonly\nbasis for a decision, with the implied so long as the goal is diversity (supposedly good on its face) and not whitewashing (naughty.)\nIt is this policy the Supreme Court refused to review. \u201cThe holding,\u201d Associate Justice Samuel Alito added in his\ndissent\n, \u201ceffectively licenses official actors to discriminate against any racial group [Asians, in the instance of TJ] with impunity as long as that group continues to perform at a higher rate than other groups.\u201d\nThat is all history because enough time has passed that we now know the results of this legal tomfoolery. Once the top-ranked public high school in the nation, T.J.\nfell\nto\n14th\nplace in the 2024 U.S. News rankings. According to the U.S. News Best High School Rankings Methodology, academic performance constitutes at least 50 percent of a school\u2019s overall ranking. This includes standardized test scores and participation and success rates in advanced courses like IB and AP, contributing to two categories that hold significant weight in determining a school\u2019s ranking: college readiness and state assessment proficiency.\nAlso, the school, which once boasted 157 National Merit Scholar semifinalists in 2020, saw that\ndown to 81\nfor the 2025 scholarship competition. (The school says the data may also reflect educational disruptions during the Covid pandemic.)\n\u201cThe decline is the inevitable consequence of elevating \u2018equity\u2019 over excellence,\u201d wrote Mark Spooner on his\nblog\n, Fairfax Schools Monitor. \u201cIn 2020, then-Superintendent Scott Braband announced the School Board\u2019s determination that DEI would no longer be \u2018\na\nthing\u2019; it would henceforth be \u2018\nthe\nthing\u2019 in the Fairfax County public school system. T.J. was the obvious first target for this \u2018social justice\u2019 initiative because more than 70 percent of its students, admitted under rigorous academic criteria, were Asian Americans. The racial imbalance was deemed unacceptable.\u201d\nSpooner went on to\nwrite\n,\nWe are more than three years into the T.J. experiment, but the Fairfax County School Board hasn\u2019t yet addressed its successes and failures. Whether an objective analysis will ever be conducted is questionable, for the program was adopted primarily for ideological reasons, and the Board may be reluctant to subject its ideological assumptions to scrutiny.\nThe elimination of entrance exams and other academic criteria forced T.J. to introduce remedial math courses for academically unprepared students. How many students needed to be enrolled in these programs? And did the programs succeed in rapidly bringing students up to speed so they would thereafter thrive at T.J.? We don\u2019t know, but there are disturbing clues. Information has emerged that the drop-out rate at T.J. has spiked, particularly among some minority groups. If this is true, it suggests that the softened admissions standards may have hurt the very students who were intended as beneficiaries.\nThough it appeared to have been settled by the Supreme Court\u2019s non-intervention, the Virginia attorney general\u2019s recent move may reopen the issue. According to the AG, Asian American students received 56 fewer offers of admission immediately following the shift in policies, after consistently making up more than 65 percent of admitted students. He said the school was already a \u201cminority majority high school,\u201d but the board \u201cdetermined it was the wrong minorities. The board abandoned a race-neutral, merit-based system that previously was in place, and they adopted a policy structure specifically designed to reduce the number of Asian American students.\u201d\nThe attorney general referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice for further enforcement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act as a next step. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold money from schools and colleges over DEI efforts that amount to discrimination, and has opened an\ninvestigation\ninto TJ\u2019s admissions policy.\nIt seems that even as the influence of DEI wanes across the country, some schools just haven\u2019t learned. Based on the test scores, perhaps neither have their students.\nThe post\nThe DEI-Fueled Collapse of a Virginia Magnet School\nappeared first on\nThe American Conservative\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Decline in TJ High School's national ranking to 14th place|Reduction in National Merit Scholar semifinalists from 157 to 81|Virginia Attorney General's claim of violation of Virginia Human Rights Act and Title VI|Federal investigation into TJ's admissions policy|Shift in student demographics: Black students increased from 1% to 7%, Asian American students decreased from 73% to 54%|Elimination of rigorous entrance exam replaced by \"holistic review\"|Coalition for TJ lawsuit and subsequent legal battles|Supreme Court declined certiorari in Coalition for T.J. v.

He has proven his ability to change stances while maintaining domestic support and, on various Middle East issues, appears to have given negotiators a long leash, empowering them to push for agreements that seemingly\ndeviate\nfrom Trump\u2019s own rhetoric.\nHe will need to show such flexibility again if he wants to finalize a deal with Iran. Trump\nwrote\non social media that the United States would not allow Iran to enrich uranium, contradicting the proposal reportedly put forward by his lead negotiator, Steve Witkoff. If the United States maintains maximalist demands for zero enrichment, talks are doomed to fail, making both an Iranian bomb and a U.S.-Iran war more likely. An acceptable deal is within reach, however, but only if Washington adopts a pragmatic approach focused on constraining Iranian enrichment and abandons the unrealistic goal of eliminating it entirely.\nThe Enrichment Standoff\nWhile negotiations gained some momentum early on, the two sides\u2019 red lines on enrichment have emerged as a major sticking point. Witkoff initially\nsuggested\nWashington might tolerate low-level enrichment, but both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio now publicly\ninsist\nthat Washington will not accept any enrichment and that Tehran\u2019s nuclear facilities must be fully dismantled.\nHowever, Axios\nreported\nthat the recent U.S. proposal to Iran would allow \u201climited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil\u201d and would establish a regional nuclear consortium. This would be a significant shift that could help break the impasse. Shortly after, however, Trump wrote on Truth Social that any agreement \u201cWILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!\u201d Subsequent\nreports\nsuggest that Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium at low levels in the \u201copening years of the proposed arrangement\u201d but would be required to end domestic enrichment once the consortium began operations. Iranian officials,\nincluding\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have\nsaid\nTehran will reject the proposal precisely because of these zero-enrichment demands.\nMany in Washington will accept nothing less than Iranian capitulation to maximalist U.S. demands. In May, more than 200 Republican lawmakers\nsigned\na letter insisting on the full dismantlement of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY)\ncalled\nthe reported proposal allowing low-level enrichment a \u201cside deal that lets Iran get away with everything.\u201d\nDemands for zero enrichment and dismantlement are a poison pill for any deal.\nIran has steadfastly rejected such terms for decades, and understandably so; its right to domestic enrichment is enshrined in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently reaffirmed this stance,\nsaying\na deal \u201censuring that Iran will not have nuclear weapons \u2026 is within reach,\u201d but that Iranian enrichment \u201cwill continue with or without a deal.\u201d This position represents a broad\nconsensus\nin Iran,\nuniting\nreformists and hardliners alike.\nIt is essential that unreasonable, maximalist demands are not allowed to collapse negotiations. Without an agreement, the United States and Iran could quickly find themselves on a path to war. The Iranian nuclear program is more advanced than ever, with Tehran\nnearly doubling\nits stockpile of near weapons-grade, 60-percent-enriched uranium since February. Meanwhile, the October deadline for European parties to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to \u201csnap back\u201d sanctions lifted under the deal is fast approaching, and they are likely to do so if no deal is reached by then. If that happens, Iranian officials have\nvowed\nto\nleave\nthe NPT, which would\nsignificantly weaken\nmonitoring of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, close the door to diplomacy, and raise the risk of preventive action. Failure to reach a deal would hand ammunition to those in the administration, Congress, and Israel pushing for strikes. Indeed, Trump has warned that Tehran must \u201cmove quickly,\u201d or \u201csomething bad\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\nA Path Forward\nConventional wisdom in Washington holds that if Tehran rejects complete denuclearization, the only alternative is military action. Trump himself has\nsaid\nthat Washington has two choices for handling Iran\u2019s nuclear sites: \u201cblow them up nicely or blow them up viciously.\u201d However, military force\ncannot permanently dismantle\nIran\u2019s nuclear program and would likely motivate Tehran to finally go for the bomb. Moreover, an attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites would almost certainly trigger a broader war that would be massively expensive in both American lives and dollars.\nWashington does not need to choose between unrealistic demands and a costly war. A third path\u2014a more limited but still sufficient agreement\u2014is still on the table. Iran, weakened by sanctions and setbacks in the region, is eager for an agreement\u2014as long as Washington abandons the zero-enrichment poison pill.\nAn endorsement by Trump, the dominant force in his party, would be enough to move forward a reasonable deal. While Iran hawks would condemn any agreement with Tehran, the public would likely reward him.\nPolls show\nthat a majority of Americans oppose military action against Iran and support a diplomatic agreement, even if it allows limited enrichment.\nThe president has already demonstrated a\nwillingness to pivot\nfrom maximalist positions in the Middle East and elsewhere, and has not been punished by voters. Trump\nended strikes\nagainst the Houthis, quickly reversing policy with little domestic pushback. Trump also surprised many by\nending sanctions\nagainst Syria, embracing Syria\u2019s new leader, and almost overnight resetting relations with the country.\nFurthermore, Trump has positioned Witkoff in a way that makes a deal far more achievable. Rather than engaging in major multilateral talks in search of a comprehensive deal like the JCPOA, Trump has given Witkoff the leeway to act as his emissary to understand the Iranian position and obtain an agreement, which could then be the foundation for future deals that could include additional parties. This approach has\nupset the Europeans\n, but it is the best method for securing a quick deal that avoids conflict between the U.S. and Iran.\nThe contours of a workable agreement are clear. Crucially, a deal need not forbid Iranian enrichment for it to successfully prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. What matters is robust monitoring, the disposal of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium, and strict limits on enrichment levels\u2014conditions Iranian officials have repeatedly\nstated\nthey would accept. Tehran has also\nsignaled openness\nto a U.S.-proposed regional enrichment consortium, so long as enrichment takes place on Iranian soil.\nThis is not the maximalist \u201c\nLibyan model\n,\u201d but it is enough to significantly extend Iran\u2019s breakout time, contain the most dangerous aspects of its program, and defuse the crisis.\nMaximalist demands threaten\nto scuttle negotiations and put the United States and Iran on a path toward war. But if Trump chooses pragmatism, he has a real opportunity to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Such an agreement could be a first, crucial step toward the regional grand bargain that Trump desires. At the very least, the United States would have\none less crisis\nto worry about.\nThe post\nTo Make a Deal with Iran, Abandon Maximalist Demands\nappeared first on\nThe American Conservative\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Abandon maximalist demands|Negotiations are doomed without flexibility|Pragmatic approach is needed|Zero enrichment is unrealistic|Limited enrichment is acceptable;E:Trump wants a deal with Iran|Negotiations gained momentum|U.S. proposal allows limited enrichment|Trump contradicts negotiator|Iran rejects zero-enrichment demands|October deadline for sanctions snapback|Trump warns of consequences|Trump pivots from maximalist positions;D:Iran stockpile nearly doubled|Iran is eager for an agreement|Majority of Americans oppose military action|Trump ended strikes against Houthis|Trump ended sanctions against Syria;", "er_digest": "N:Steve Witkoff|Axios|Abbas Araghchi|Chuck Schumer|Marco Rubio|Donald Trump|Ayatollah Ali Khamenei;R:Syria|Middle East|Iran|United States;", "gist": "P:Abandon maximalist demands|Negotiations are doomed without flexibility|Pragmatic approach is needed|Zero enrichment is unrealistic|Limited enrichment is acceptable;E:Trump wants a deal with Iran|Negotiations gained momentum|U.S. proposal allows limited enrichment|Trump contradicts negotiator|Iran rejects zero-enrichment demands|October deadline for sanctions snapback|Trump warns of consequences|Trump pivots from maximalist positions;D:Iran stockpile nearly doubled|Iran is eager for an agreement|Majority of Americans oppose military action|Trump ended strikes against Houthis|Trump ended sanctions against Syria;N:Steve Witkoff|Axios|Abbas Araghchi|Chuck Schumer|Marco Rubio|Donald Trump|Ayatollah Ali Khamenei;R:Syria|Middle East|Iran|United States;", "entities": ["Steve Witkoff", "Axios", "Abbas Araghchi", "Chuck Schumer", "Marco Rubio", "Donald Trump", "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei"], "regions": ["Syria", "Middle East", "Iran", "United States"]}, {"_id": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/mr-luis-santos-discusses-turim-hotels-at-itb-china/", "content": "Mr. Luis Santos\nis the\nDirector of Commercial Operations\nat\nTurim Hotels\n, a renowned hotel chain based in\nPortugal\n.

Meanwhile, in response to overtourism, Ibiza has introduced strict vehicle restrictions for nonresidents during the summer months. Norway is making strides in sustainable tourism by launching a pioneering tourist tax aimed at improving local infrastructure and mitigating the effects of mass tourism. On the seas, Norwegian Cruise Line has faced significant disruptions due to extreme weather conditions, including powerful winds, underscoring the growing challenges faced by the cruise industry in unpredictable weather. These developments highlight the evolving global response to security, environmental, and operational pressures.\nIbiza Enforces Summer Cap on Tourist Vehicles Amid Traffic Woes\nIbiza, one of Spain\u2019s most iconic island getaways, is taking firm steps to control its seasonal traffic surge. Starting June 1 through September 30, the Balearic island will impose a strict cap on the number of vehicles nonresidents can bring or rent. A total of 20,168 cars and caravans will be permitted\u2014of which 16,000 are allocated to rental fleets, with the rest coming from outside areas like mainland Spain.\nTo operate a vehicle on the island, tourists must now pay a \u20ac1 daily fee for a driving permit. Caravan travelers must also secure reservations at designated campsites. Notably, bicycles are currently exempt from the vehicle limitations.\nThis regulation is part of a broader effort to tackle overtourism and reduce traffic congestion, especially during the busy summer months. Ibiza, home to about 160,000 residents, attracts over 3 million visitors annually. Vehicle numbers have quadrupled over the past two decades\u2014from 51,000 in 2002 to more than 200,000 in recent years\u2014leading to increased strain on local infrastructure.\nNorway Launches Tourist Tax to Manage Rising Visitor Numbers\nNorway has become the latest country in Europe to implement a tourism tax aimed at balancing visitor growth with infrastructure needs. Following a significant increase in international arrivals\u2014driven in part by the rising popularity of \u201ccoolcations\u201d\u2014the country has authorized municipalities to impose up to a\nthree percent\ntax on overnight stays.\nThe new measure, designed to support improvements for both residents and travelers, allows flexibility for local governments to set the rate and timing of the tax based on tourism flow and seasonal demand.\nLast year, the country recorded over\n38 million overnight bookings\n, a remarkable figure for a nation of just five million. As travelers flock to its fjords, mountains, and northern lights, the tourism tax aims to protect the country\u2019s fragile ecosystems and public amenities.\nThis policy brings Norway in line with other top European destinations that have already introduced tourism levies, such as Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, and Venice.\nOversized Aircraft Forces Diversion, Passengers Finish Journey by Bus\nA recent transatlantic flight headed for Naples, Italy, encountered a surprising obstacle\u2014not weather or technical failure, but sheer aircraft size. The flight, originating from the United States, had been scheduled to land in Naples but was rerouted mid-air due to airport limitations when a larger-than-usual aircraft model was deployed.\nThe aircraft had to divert to Rome, where 231 passengers were safely disembarked. From there, the travelers completed their journey via a three-hour bus transfer. Though the airline issued an apology and offered support, the incident underscored the importance of proper aircraft-to-airport planning, particularly as larger jets are increasingly used on transatlantic routes.\nStrong Winds Dislodge Cruise Ship, Guest Falls Overboard in Sicily\nIn a dramatic maritime episode, a cruise ship was forced to halt disembarkation procedures after violent winds caused it to drift from its moorings while docked in Sicily. During the disturbance, a guest fell into the water but was swiftly rescued and later treated for minor injuries.\nWinds reaching speeds of up to 45 mph caused the temporary chaos. After the weather stabilized, the cruise ship resumed docking and continued its scheduled 10-day voyage through the Mediterranean, with stops in Italy, Greece, and France.\nThe incident highlights the unpredictable nature of weather-related disruptions in cruise travel, as well as the importance of responsive safety protocols.\nBroad Travel Ban Now in Effect for 12 Countries\nA newly implemented travel ban is now in force, affecting passport holders from 12 nations across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The restrictions include full entry bans for countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Libya, and Myanmar, while others face partial constraints.\nWhile some categories of travelers\u2014including lawful U.S. residents, diplomats, and athletes\u2014may qualify for exemptions, the policy introduces a sweeping set of barriers for ordinary travelers from the listed countries. Additional nations may also be added based on future security assessments, and current restrictions could be lifted if geopolitical conditions improve.\nThis move is expected to impact immigration, student mobility, family reunification, and international tourism flows to and from affected regions.\nConclusion: Travel Policies Are Evolving Fast\u2014Stay Informed\nWhether it\u2019s vehicle restrictions on European islands, new levies in scenic Nordic regions, or broader geopolitical shifts influencing global mobility, the travel environment continues to evolve. As destinations strive to balance sustainability, security, and service, travelers are encouraged to stay updated on local regulations and advisories.\nThe post\nYemen, Sudan, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Haiti, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Myanmar, Equatorial Guinea, and Eritrea Now Banned by U.S. as Ibiza Restricts Car Access, Norway Unveils Groundbreaking Tax on Tourists, and Norwegian Cruise Faces Major Weather Challenges\nappeared first on\nTravel And Tour World\n.", "ped_digest": "P:U.S. imposes travel ban|Ibiza restricts vehicle access|Norway launches tourist tax|Norwegian Cruise Line faces weather disruptions;E:Travel ban enacted|Vehicle restrictions introduced|Tourist tax implemented|Cruise ship disrupted;D:20,168 vehicle cap (Ibiza)|\u20ac1 daily fee (Ibiza)|3% tourist tax (Norway)|38 million overnight bookings (Norway)|45 mph winds (Sicily)|231 passengers diverted;", "er_digest": "R:Iran|Rome|Italy|France|Norway|Chad|Greece|Haiti|Naples|Europe|Paris|Sudan|Afghanistan|Somalia|Myanmar|Yemen|U.S.|Libya|Spain;", "gist": "P:U.S. imposes travel ban|Ibiza restricts vehicle access|Norway launches tourist tax|Norwegian Cruise Line faces weather disruptions;E:Travel ban enacted|Vehicle restrictions introduced|Tourist tax implemented|Cruise ship disrupted;D:20,168 vehicle cap (Ibiza)|\u20ac1 daily fee (Ibiza)|3% tourist tax (Norway)|38 million overnight bookings (Norway)|45 mph winds (Sicily)|231 passengers diverted;R:Iran|Rome|Italy|France|Norway|Chad|Greece|Haiti|Naples|Europe|Paris|Sudan|Afghanistan|Somalia|Myanmar|Yemen|U.S.|Libya|Spain;", "entities": null, "regions": ["Iran", "Rome", "Italy", "France", "Norway", "Chad", "Greece", "Haiti", "Naples", "Europe", "Paris", "Sudan", "Afghanistan", "Somalia", "Myanmar", "Yemen", "U.S.", "Libya", "Spain"]}, {"_id": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pam-bondis-pro-trump-brother-brad-bondi-loses-dc-bar-election-by-landslide/", "content": "Skip to Main Content\nHOMEPAGE\nPolitics\nPam Bondi\u2019s \u2018Pro-Trump\u2019 Brother Loses Election by Landslide\nFAMILY TIES\nBrad Bondi had been trying to be president of the Washington D.C.

But tucked inside a glass case at the Rijksmuseum, an unassuming tube of animal membrane is making a big splash. It is, of course, a condom, but not your average condom.\nMade some 200 years ago from sheep appendix, the sheath depicts a scandalous scene: a nun and three clergymen in a suggestive pose, with the French phrase \u201cVoil\u00e0 mon choix\u201d \u2014 \u201cThere, that\u2019s my choice\u201d \u2014 curling along the side. The phrase is a parody of both celibacy and the Judgment of Paris from Greek mythology, historians say.\nSex in the City\nCondoms have a long and\nstoried history\n. They\u2019ve existed in various forms for thousands of years, with the earliest evidence dating back to\nancient Egypt\n. In Renaissance Europe, they were primarily used to prevent syphilis, often made from linen or animal membranes like sheep intestines. By the 18th and early 19th centuries, condoms remained expensive, reusable items, discreetly sold and\nmorally controversial\n.\nIt was only with the invention of vulcanized rubber in 1839 that condoms started to resemble what we know today. Later, latex versions in the 20th century cemented their role in public health, transforming condoms from whispered curiosities into essential tools for safer sex.\nThis 19th century condom now serves as the centerpiece of a new exhibition titled\nSafe Sex?\n, exploring 19th-century sexuality, sex work, and the long, messy history of contraception. Alongside it hang prints and photographs that flicker between prudishness and eroticism\u2014cultural artifacts from an age still wrestling with the same anxieties we know today.\nDespite its cheeky message, the object comes from a serious time. In 1830s Europe, syphilis raged, abortion was illegal, and\nunplanned pregnancies\nruined lives. Condoms, while not especially reliable, offered some sliver of control. No one wants to use a sheep\u2019s intestine as a condom, but it\u2019s better than the alternative.\nYet the Catholic Church and much of \u201cproper\u201d society condemned them. In brothels and barbershops, they were traded discreetly under the counter. This condom was also likely a brothel souvenir.\nRelated\nPosts\nOver 100 museums have turned their collections into coloring books \u2014 and they\u2019re free to use\nWho invented ice cream?

The condom is in mint condition. \u201cAs far as we can tell we are the only art museum with a printed condom,\u201d said Ms Zelen.\nThe museum said the unusual item \u201cembodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health, in an era when the quest for sensual pleasure was fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and\nsexually transmitted diseases\n\u2014 especially syphilis.\u201d\n\u201cIn the 1830s, when this condom was made, the use of condoms was still frowned upon, especially by the church,\u201d said Zelen. \u201cThey were mostly sold under the counter at brothels or barber shops, though there are some reports of luxury shops offering bespoke tailoring.\u201d\nBut would you see it in the same building as a Rembrandt?\nSo far, the museum says, the public is loving the exhibit. Since the show opened, crowds of all ages have packed the gallery. Sure, it challenges traditional museum boundaries, but it\u2019s not just a curiosity. It merges intimate history with public exhibition, inviting visitors to reflect not just on what we preserve, but\nwhy\n. The image is pixelated in some listings, but in person, it\u2019s impossible to ignore, and it forces people to face the long, often hidden history of sexual practice.\nThat this condom survives at all is remarkable. That it now occupies space in one of Europe\u2019s most respected museums is a quiet, winking triumph for our often-ignored sexual history.\nTags:\nAmsterdam\ncondom\nhistory\nmuseum\nMihai Andrei\nDr. Andrei Mihai is a geophysicist and founder of ZME Science.

Frameworks\nResti Guay\n8 min read\n\u00b7\n1 hour ago\n--\nThe Hidden Crisis in Modern Web Development\nWhy our pursuit of features has led us astray from simplicity, and what we can do about it\n5 min read\n\u2022 Web Development \u2022 Software Engineering\nWe need to talk about the elephant in the room: modern web development has become unnecessarily complex. While we\u2019ve been chasing the latest features and paradigms, we\u2019ve lost sight of what actually matters \u2014 building websites that work reliably, load quickly, and can be maintained by real development teams.\nThe frameworks we\u2019ve chosen aren\u2019t just complex; they\u2019re\nfundamentally misaligned\nwith how the web actually works.\nThe Complexity Trap We\u2019ve Built for Ourselves\nLet\u2019s be brutally honest about what building a \u201csimple\u201d website looks like today. When you want to create a basic interactive webpage, you don\u2019t just write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript anymore. Instead, you embark on a journey that looks something like this:\nFirst, you install your framework of choice. But that framework doesn\u2019t work alone \u2014 it needs a build system. The build system needs plugins. The plugins need configuration files. The configuration files need more dependencies. Before you know it, you\u2019re managing 78 different packages just to render \u201cHello World\u201d in a browser.\nFor perspective, the entire jQuery library \u2014 which powered millions of websites for over a decade and enabled the interactive web as we know it \u2014 is smaller than most modern framework\u2019s\ndependency list\n. Let that sink in for a moment.\nWe\u2019ve normalized this madness. We\u2019ve convinced ourselves that 200KB+ JavaScript bundles, complex build processes, and dozens of configuration files are the \u201cmodern\u201d way to build websites. We treat this complexity as inevitable, even desirable, because it signals that we\u2019re using \u201cprofessional\u201d tools.\nBut what if we\u2019re wrong? What if this complexity isn\u2019t a necessary evil, but just evil?\nThe False Promise of Magical Abstractions\nFramework advocates will tell you that complexity is worth it because frameworks provide \u201cpowerful abstractions.\u201d This sounds reasonable until you examine what these abstractions actually cost us in real projects with real deadlines and real human beings trying to get work done.\nConsider the layers of abstraction in a typical modern web project. You write code in JSX, which gets transformed by Babel into JavaScript that looks nothing like what you wrote. That JavaScript gets bundled by Webpack using rules you probably don\u2019t fully understand. The bundle gets optimized by tools that make assumptions about how your code will be used. Finally, a runtime framework interprets your transformed, bundled, optimized code and decides what to actually show the user.\nAt each layer, things can go wrong in ways that are difficult to diagnose. When they do go wrong, you\u2019re not just debugging your code \u2014 you\u2019re debugging the interaction between your code, the framework, the build system, the state management library, and potentially a dozen other moving parts you didn\u2019t even know existed.\nThe Build Complexity Mountain\nModern build systems have become so complex that companies hire dedicated \u201cbuild engineers\u201d whose entire job is maintaining the machinery that turns source code into websites. Think about how absurd this is: we need specialists just to make our tools work.\nThese build systems promise to make development easier, but they actually make it harder in subtle ways. Hot module replacement works until it doesn\u2019t, and when it breaks, you lose hours figuring out why your changes aren\u2019t showing up. Source maps help you debug code that looks nothing like what you wrote, which is only necessary because the build system transformed your readable code into something incomprehensible.\nThe Runtime Complexity Beast\nThen there\u2019s the runtime complexity. Modern frameworks run sophisticated algorithms on every state change, reconciling virtual representations of the DOM with the actual DOM. They manage component lifecycles with subtle timing dependencies. They provide hook systems that require expert knowledge to use efficiently and avoid performance pitfalls.\nThis complexity exists to solve problems that the frameworks themselves created. React\u2019s\nuseMemo\n,\nuseCallback\n, and\nReact.memo\nexist precisely because React's default behavior is inefficient. You need these optimization techniques because the framework does unnecessary work by default.\nWhat Complexity Actually Costs Your Team\nHere\u2019s what all this complexity costs in terms that matter to real projects and real people:\nThe Onboarding Nightmare\nA new developer joining a React project needs to understand JSX syntax, the component model, hooks and their dependency arrays, state management patterns, the build system, testing frameworks, routing libraries, and styling solutions. That\u2019s weeks or months of ramp-up time before they can make meaningful contributions.\nCompare this to a vanilla JavaScript project where someone with basic web development knowledge can start contributing immediately. They can read the HTML, understand the CSS, and follow the JavaScript logic without learning framework-specific abstractions.\nThe Debugging Black Hole\nWhen something breaks in a complex framework setup, the debugging process becomes exponentially more difficult. You\u2019re not just debugging your logic \u2014 you\u2019re debugging the interaction between layers of abstraction you don\u2019t control.\nI\u2019ve witnessed teams spend entire sprints tracking down issues that turned out to be version incompatibilities between packages they didn\u2019t even know they were using. The error messages are often cryptic because they originate from deep within framework internals, not from your actual business logic.\nThe Performance Paradox\nFrameworks promise good performance out of the box, but they only deliver it if you become an expert in framework-specific optimization techniques. The \u201cfast by default\u201d promise falls apart as soon as you try to build anything non-trivial.\nMeanwhile, vanilla JavaScript is genuinely fast by default. When you manipulate the DOM directly, you know exactly what work is being done. When you manage state explicitly, you control exactly when updates happen. There\u2019s no hidden reconciliation algorithm deciding whether your updates are worth processing.\nThe Maintenance Time Bomb\nFramework projects accumulate technical debt faster than simple projects because complexity compounds over time. Every dependency is a potential security vulnerability that needs monitoring. Every abstraction layer is a potential point of failure. Every framework update is a potential breaking change that could require significant refactoring.\nTeams often find themselves trapped by their framework choices. Migration becomes impossible because too much code depends on framework-specific patterns. You\u2019re locked in, forced to follow the framework\u2019s evolution whether it aligns with your needs or not.\nThe Web Platform is Better Than We Give It Credit For\nHere\u2019s a perspective that might surprise you: the web platform itself is more capable and elegant than the frameworks we\u2019ve built on top of it. Modern browsers provide a rich set of features that can handle most web development needs without additional abstractions.\nThe platform gives us Web Components for creating reusable UI elements with true encapsulation. CSS Grid and Flexbox provide layout capabilities that previously required complex JavaScript solutions. ES Modules offer code organization without build tools. The Fetch API handles network requests elegantly. Local Storage and IndexedDB provide data persistence. Web Workers enable background processing. Service Workers power offline functionality.\nYou can build sophisticated, interactive web applications using just these platform features. The frameworks aren\u2019t filling gaps in the platform \u2014 they\u2019re replacing platform features with more complex alternatives that require you to learn framework-specific APIs instead of web standards.\nWhen you build on web standards, your knowledge transfers between projects. When you build on framework abstractions, your knowledge becomes trapped within that framework\u2019s ecosystem.\nWhat Simplicity Actually Looks Like in Practice\nSimple doesn\u2019t mean primitive or unsophisticated. Simple means you can understand what your code is doing, debug it when it breaks, and modify it when requirements change. Simple means the complexity in your system is essential complexity that solves real problems, not accidental complexity that exists because of your tools.\nA simple approach prioritizes transparency over magic. If state management requires three lines of explicit code instead of one line of framework magic, that\u2019s often a better trade-off. The explicit version is debuggable, modifiable, and understandable by anyone who reads it.\nSimple systems build on standards that will outlast any particular framework. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aren\u2019t going anywhere. They\u2019ve been stable for decades and will continue to be stable for decades more. Framework APIs, on the other hand, change with every major version, forcing you to constantly relearn how to accomplish the same tasks.\nSimple systems make dependencies explicit rather than hiding them behind abstractions. If your component needs data, it should receive that data explicitly through parameters rather than reaching into global state or context systems that make dependencies invisible and testing difficult.\nThe Path Forward: Choosing Complexity Wisely\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we should abandon all abstractions and write everything in assembly language. It means we should treat complexity as a finite resource and spend it carefully on solving real problems rather than framework problems.\nBefore reaching for a framework, ask yourself: What specific problem am I trying to solve? Could I solve it with vanilla JavaScript and web standards? What\u2019s the smallest possible solution that would work? Often, the answer is simpler than you think.\nStart measuring the things that actually matter: time to first render, bundle size, dependency count, build time, and new developer onboarding time. These metrics tell you the real cost of your architectural decisions. A framework that reduces lines of code but increases build time and bundle size isn\u2019t actually making your project simpler \u2014 it\u2019s just moving complexity around.\nEmbrace progressive enhancement as a development philosophy. Start with HTML that works without JavaScript, then add CSS for styling, then add JavaScript for interactivity. This approach naturally leads to simpler, more resilient solutions because it forces you to solve problems in the order of their importance.\nChoose boring technology whenever possible. Dan McKinley\u2019s principle of \u201cChoose Boring Technology\u201d applies perfectly to frontend development. Proven, stable technologies are usually more valuable than cutting-edge frameworks that might be abandoned or radically changed in a few years.\nThe Uncomfortable Truth About What We Actually Need\nThe uncomfortable truth is that most websites don\u2019t need the complexity we\u2019ve imposed on them. A blog doesn\u2019t need a virtual DOM. A marketing site doesn\u2019t need state management. A simple dashboard doesn\u2019t need a framework at all.\nWe\u2019ve convinced ourselves that complexity is inevitable, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a choice we make with every architectural decision, every dependency we add, every abstraction layer we introduce.\nLook at the websites that have stood the test of time \u2014 Wikipedia, Hacker News, Berkshire Hathaway. They\u2019re notable for their simplicity and reliability, not for their framework choice. They prioritize content delivery, accessibility, and performance over architectural sophistication.\nConclusion: Simplicity as a Competitive Advantage\nWe\u2019ve been building websites with the wrong frameworks not because the frameworks are technically inadequate, but because they optimize for the wrong outcomes. They optimize for developer experience during the first week of a project, not the developer experience during the 100th week. They optimize for feature velocity in demos, not long-term maintainability in real projects. They optimize for framework adoption, not web platform advancement.\nThe next time you start a project, consider taking a radically different approach. Start simple. Add complexity only when you can measure its benefits. Question the tools that promise to make things easier but require expert knowledge to use effectively.\nThe web platform is more powerful and elegant than ever. Maybe it\u2019s time we started using it directly instead of through layers of abstraction that obscure its power and add unnecessary complexity to our projects.\nYour future self \u2014 and your future team members \u2014 will thank you for choosing simplicity over complexity, transparency over magic, and standards over frameworks. In a world where everyone is adding layers of abstraction, simplicity becomes a competitive advantage.\nWhat\u2019s your experience with framework complexity?

These alarming claims of captivity and horrific abuse were amplified across social media platforms and through unverified tips, stirring concern among those wishing her well.\nHowever, police have since confirmed there were no indications of prolonged captivity or torture. Her mother expressed a sense of relief, stating that this confirmation brought her \u201cpeace\u201d in knowing her daughter likely did not endure such imagined suffering.\nThe Lakewood Police Department has initiated a \u201csuspicious death\u201d investigation.

She never came back, leaving behind her cat, medication, and personal belongings.\nThe case was initially reported a week later as a missing person, tragically extending into two months of anxious searching. Her absence was highly uncharacteristic; friends noted she consistently kept in touch with her family, especially on occasions like Easter Sunday, yet she failed to do so. A dedicated Facebook group, \u201cFind Jax Gratton Denver,\u201d grew to over 1,800 members, and flyers were distributed throughout the city.\nDiscovery of the body\nA passerby located the body in a Lakewood alleyway on June 6. According to law enforcement, the remains were in an advanced state of decomposition, but were visually identified by her distinctive tattoos and the clothing she wore on the night of her disappearance.\nHer mother shared that a detective visually confirmed the identity, which spared the family additional weeks of waiting for formal identification. Cherilynne stated that she finds comfort in the belief that Gratton likely died on the night she vanished, rather than enduring weeks of suffering.\nA Legacy of light and activism\nNOW: A rally in support of 34 y/o Jax Gratton happening outside Denver\u2019s City/County building.\nHer family says Gratton was found dead in a Lakewood alley Friday, after being missing for nearly two months.

AutoMix uses intelligence to transition from one song to the next like a DJ, using time stretching and beat matching to seamlessly move from one song to the next.\nIn Apple Maps, Visited Places help users remember the places they\u2019ve been. Users can choose to have iPhone detect when they\u2019re at a place like a restaurant or shop, and view all of their Visited Places in Maps. Visited Places are protected with end-to-end encryption and cannot be accessed by Apple.

Announced by Craig Federighi at WWDC 2025, the brand-new Foundation Models Framework opens the door for apps to integrate on-device AI\u2011powered features, without relying on cloud services and with no API fees.\nUntil now, Apple\u2019s on-device AI was restricted to its own apps. Mail could summarize emails, Notes could use Genmoji, and Messages could auto-suggest polls. The new framework changes all that. Apps for tasks like quizzes, visuals, or productivity tools can tap directly into models of varying sizes, from basic 3\u202fB param models for lightweight tasks to more complex 150\u202fB models for nuanced reasoning. These remain local to iPhone and iPad, preserving privacy and enabling offline use.\nFederighi highlighted example use cases during his demo: study apps can generate personalized quizzes; outdoor apps can run natural-language search entirely offline. The setup is designed to be easy. With just a few lines of Swift code, developers can call on guided generation, classification, summarization, and more.\nThis move is Apple\u2019s answer to rapid competition in AI from platforms like OpenAI, Google, and even third-party LLMs, especially after previous delays in upgrading Siri and general generative AI features. At the same time, macOS 26, iOS 26, iPadOS\u202f26, and other platforms will debut built-in AI features like live translation, smarter Shortcuts, image creation tools, and expanded Genmoji. But letting third-party developers access the models themselves is the most notable change, one that could truly democratize intelligent features across the Apple ecosystem.\nDevelopers can begin testing today as part of the WWDC beta cycle, ahead of a public beta next month and the full release this fall, alongside the annual OS updates. It\u2019s a modest step, but one with meaningful implications: smart assistants, translation tools, and productivity helpers can now become common across apps rather than confined to core Apple services.\nWhy This Matters\nApple\u2019s approach centers on privacy-first AI by keeping all inference local to the device. This means user data never leaves the phone or tablet, preserving privacy and enabling offline functionality. There\u2019s also no cost barrier, developers can integrate these AI features without paying API fees. That makes it easier for smaller teams or indie developers to build intelligent features into their apps without relying on cloud infrastructure.\nWhile the demos focused on educational and productivity scenarios, the implications stretch far wider. With the tools now available, we\u2019re likely to see an uptick in smart assistants, translation helpers, and automated workflows across third-party apps, many of which could rival Apple\u2019s own in functionality and user reach.\n240899\nYadullah Abidi\nnews\n0\n1749488239", "ped_digest": "P:Apple opens Foundation Models Framework for developers|AI models now accessible for app integration|No API fees for developers|Privacy-first AI approach with on-device processing|Democratization of intelligent features across the Apple ecosystem;E:WWDC 2025 announcement of Foundation Models Framework|Craig Federighi's demo of AI use cases|Developers can begin testing today|macOS 26, iOS 26, iPadOS 26 to debut built-in AI features;D:3B parameter models for lightweight tasks|150B models for nuanced reasoning|Release alongside annual OS updates this fall;", "er_digest": "N:iPadOS 26|macOS 26|iOS 26|Google|Craig Federighi|Apple|Yadullah Abidi|Siri;", "gist": "P:Apple opens Foundation Models Framework for developers|AI models now accessible for app integration|No API fees for developers|Privacy-first AI approach with on-device processing|Democratization of intelligent features across the Apple ecosystem;E:WWDC 2025 announcement of Foundation Models Framework|Craig Federighi's demo of AI use cases|Developers can begin testing today|macOS 26, iOS 26, iPadOS 26 to debut built-in AI features;D:3B parameter models for lightweight tasks|150B models for nuanced reasoning|Release alongside annual OS updates this fall;N:iPadOS 26|macOS 26|iOS 26|Google|Craig Federighi|Apple|Yadullah Abidi|Siri;", "entities": ["iPadOS 26", "macOS 26", "iOS 26", "Google", "Craig Federighi", "Apple", "Yadullah Abidi", "Siri"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/colonel-macgregor-lifesitenews-was-exposing-globalist-warmongering-long-before-most/", "content": "Skip to content\nNews\nUSA\nCanada\nCatholic\nAbortion\nFaith\nFamily\nToday\u2019s News\nLast 10 Days\nLanguage\nEspa\u00f1ol\nPortugu\u00eas\nItaliano\nFran\u00e7ais\nPolski\nMagyar\nOpinion\nUSA\nCanada\nCatholic\nToday\u2019s Opinion\nEditorials\nAnalysis\nUSA\nCanada\nCatholic\nToday\u2019s Analysis\nBlogs\nJohn-Henry Westen\nSteve Jalsevac\nDoug Mainwaring\nJonathon Van Maren\nDorothy Cummings McLean\nMaike Hickson\nPeter Kwasniewski\nSteven Mosher\nStephen Kokx\nShows\nBreaking News\nThe John-Henry Westen Show\nFaith & Reason\nA Shepherd\u2019s Voice\nLSNTV\nMost Viral Moments\nRome Life Forum\nThe Mother Miriam Show\nVideo\nVideo Home\nMost Watched\nLatest Videos\nShows\nFollow LifeSite\nSubscribe\nTelegram\nGab\nYouTube\nLatest Events\nResources\nLifeFacts\nLifePetitions\nLifeFunder\nVoter Voice\nLifeSite\nAbout\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nReprint Permissions\nPrivacy\nLegal\nTechnical Support\nContact\nDonate\nhttp://USA\nYou have not enabled cookies!

Prisoners died from malnutrition, exhaustion, and exposure. There were constant beatings. Fear was everywhere.\u201d\nFollowing Morgentaler\u2019s release after the war, he re-entered society, grateful to have survived the camps and with an optimistic outlook on life, saying, \u201cEverything was beautiful. Everything had evolved into a celebration of life.\u201d\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t long until the pain and trauma he endured in the camps turned Morgentaler into one of the world\u2019s top serial killers, or \u201cCanada\u2019s top abortionist.\u201d\nIn the 1960s, after immigrating to Canada, Morgentaler began performing illegal abortions. His practice led to several legal battles, including the 1988 Supreme Court decision (\nR. v. Morgentaler\n) that removed abortion restrictions in Canada.\nDuring Morgentaler\u2019s life, he personally murdered 80,000 unborn babies and was responsible for the nearly five million preborn babies killed by abortion since 1969 thanks to his legal battle overturning Canada\u2019s abortion law.\n\u201cHow did Morgentaler, the victim, become Morgentaler, the perpetrator?\u201d Baklinski questioned. \u201cHow did the oppressed become the oppressor, the sufferer the killer?\u201d\nBaklinski revealed that he stumbled upon the answer while reading Viktor Frankl\u2019s 1946 book\nMan\u2019s Search for Meaning\n.\nIn the book, Frankl, an Austrian psychologist, detailed the mental anguish that camp survivors endured. According to Frankl, after liberation, many prisoners \u201ccould not escape the influences of the brutality which had surrounded them in camp life.\u201d\nAs free men re-entering society, \u201cthey thought they could use their freedom licentiously and ruthlessly.\u201d\n\u201cThe only thing that had changed for them was that they were now the oppressors instead of the oppressed,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey became instigators, not objects, of willful force and injustice.\u201d\nIndeed, this appears to have been the case for Morgentaler, who turned into something far worse than the Nazi soldiers by murdering the defenseless babies in the womb.\n\u201cAfter reading Frankl, the answer is clear: Morgentaler became psychologically twisted from his time at the Nazi camps,\u201d Baklinski explained. \u201cThe influence of brutality got to him. He became the oppressor, the instigator of willful force and injustice. He used his freedom licentiously and ruthlessly.\u201d\nFurthermore, similar to the Nazis who used dehumanizing terms to refer to the Jewish people, Morgentaler refused to admit that unborn babies had value, instead calling them \u201cclump of cells,\u201d \u201cblob of tissue,\u201d and \u201cfetus.\u201d\nMorgentaler\u2019s own writings reveal a deep sense of anger, frustration, and violence.

Practising Therapist. For therapy services, go to: https://www.rickywilliamson.com\n4,201 words\nRead time: approx. 21 mins\nIt is now widely accepted by researchers such as Michael Pollan and Brian Muraresku that the Ancient Greeks took a psychedelic-like narcotic at their Eleusinian mysteries, which were annual ritual initiations. The taking of this narcotic led to what Williams James called \u2018the mystical experience\u2019. Plato is known to have attended these mysteries and would have taken this psychedelic-like narcotic, named Kykeon. The influence this had on Plato, and as a result, Western culture as a whole, is clear to see, and was seen by Nietzsche, in ideas like Plato\u2019s cave and in religion more broadly. In this piece, contributing editor Ricky Williamson, argues that Nietzsche's critique of Plato, Christianity, and the morality that still shapes our lives today, all have the psychedelically-induced mystical experience at their core. The modern psychedelic prohibition has left thinkers afraid to draw this clear and obvious conclusion in Nietzsche\u2019s thought, argues Williamson. Western thought was shaped and has its origins in these psychedelically-induced mystical experiences. With the psychedelic renaissance in full swing, its future may lie in them too.\n\u201cUnder the influence of narcotic potions hymned by all primitive men and peoples\u2026 those Dionysiac urges are awakened.\u201d\u2014Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy\nThe coming psychedelic age represents an unpredictable future; with psychedelics increasingly legalised and re-entering the mainstream. In this future the very nature of human consciousness will change. A person is not the same person before and after a psychedelic experience. A culture in which a growing number of people have that experience cannot be expected to remain the same either.\nWhat can we learn from the psychedelic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, that could help us cultivate the positive potential of this approaching psychedelic age? And how are the history of morality and the history of psychedelics intertwined, and how will this connection re-manifest in our coming future?\nNietzsche\u2019s references to intoxication and narcotics are among the most misunderstood and underappreciated aspects of Western philosophy. This article, among other things, hopes to go some way to correcting that.\nMorality as power\nSince Nietzsche, it has been widely accepted that morality is historically contingent and that what we call \u201cthe good\u201d may just be an accident of our culture\u2014and therefore, not\nreally\n\u201cthe good.\u201d Nietzsche\u2019s\nOn the Genealogy of Morality\noutlines how our morals came to be\u2014not as the result of some divine judgement or, as Kant would argue, arrived at through reason\u2014but as the result of a power struggle.\nOur morality is born of the relationship between two historical groups: the masters and the slaves.\nNietzsche argues that once upon a time, \u201cthe good\u201d just meant \u201cwhat we masters think is good\u201d and \u201cthe bad\u201d just meant \u201cwhat we masters think is bad.\u201d This makes sense. If you have power, you also have the power to indiscriminately judge. This is how Nietzsche claims the Ancient Greeks lived, and he admired this in them. This carefree living. This carefree seeking after whatever \u201cgood\u201d they desired, without any guilt or shame for doing so.\n___\nInstead of overcoming the masters by force then, the slaves implanted morality into the minds of their masters.

Gavin Newsom confirmed the state will sue President Donald Trump after the latter\ncalled in the National Guard\nto help\nstomp out the Los Angeles riots\n.\nThis is exactly what Donald Trump wanted.\nHe flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard.\nThe order he signed doesn\u2019t just apply to CA.\nIt will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing.\nWe\u2019re suing him.\npic.twitter.com/O3RAGlp2zo\n\u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom)\nUm, does Newsom not know the law?\nThe Insurrection Act\nallows the president to\ncall in the National Guard\n(emphasis mine):\nSection 251 allows the president to deploy troops if a state\u2019s legislature (or governor if the legislature is unavailable) requests federal aid to suppress an insurrection in that state. This provision is the oldest part of the law, and the one that has most often been invoked.\nWhile Section 251 requires state consent,\nSections 252 and 253 allow the president to deploy troops without a request from the affected state, even against the state\u2019s wishes\n. Section 252 permits deployment in order to \u201cenforce the laws\u201d of the United States or to \u201csuppress rebellion\u201d whenever \u201cunlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\u201d make it \u201cimpracticable\u201d to enforce federal law in that state by the \u201cordinary course of judicial proceedings.\u201d\nSection 253 has two parts. The first\nallows the president to use the military in a state to suppress \u201cany insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy\u201d that \u201cso hinders the execution of the laws\u201d that any portion of the state\u2019s inhabitants are deprived of a constitutional right and state authorities are unable or unwilling to protect that right.\nPresidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy relied on this provision to deploy troops to desegregate schools in the South after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education.\nThe second part of Section 253\npermits the president to deploy troops to suppress \u201cany insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy\u201d in a state that \u201copposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\u201d\nThis provision is so bafflingly broad that it cannot possibly mean what it says, or else it authorizes the president to use the military against any two people conspiring to break federal law.\nYes, the law is broad, but it exists. If you want it changed then contact Congress.\nBut The Insurrection Act gives Trump the ability to call in the National Guard even if the state tells him no.\nTrump\naddressed\nthe riots numerous times on Truth Social on Sunday:\nIf Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can\u2019t do their jobs, which everyone knows they can\u2019t, then the Federal Government will step in and solved!!!\nTrump also thanked the\nNational Guard\n:\nGreat job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes and unrest. We have an incompetent Governor (Newscum) and Mayor (Bass) who were, as usual (just look at how they handled the fires, and now their VERY SLOW PERMITTING disaster. Federal permitting is complete!), unable to to handle the task. These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED. Also, from now on, MASKS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED to be worn at protests. What do these people have to hide, and why??? Again, thank you to the National Guard for a job well done!\nTrump\nalso wrote\nthat he told Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action:\nA once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations \u2014 But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve. I am directing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, in coordination with all other relevant Departments and Agencies, to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.

Bilawal, head of a diplomatic delegation constituted by the Prime Minister to respond to Indian aggression on the international front, stated that Pakistan is a responsible nuclear country that upholds faith in peace, dialogue, and diplomacy. \u201cWe have always given the message of peace,\u201d he added during a media briefing in London. He sharply cautioned India against doing anything regarding issues of water, stating that water is the lifeblood of Pakistan. \u201cIndia cannot unilaterally abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty. If India attempts to cut off our water, it will amount to an act of war,\u201d he stated. Bilawal also emphasized the need for dialogue with India on all matters, particularly Kashmir. \u201cThe answer to all problems with India starts with Kashmir,\u201d he said, indicating that India is propagating fake news to keep facts from the world.

Designed as a centralized hub for Apple\u2019s gaming ecosystem, the app organizes all installed games, highlights Game Center achievements, and connects players with friends across devices. It\u2019s the first time Apple has created a dedicated space for games, and it arrives amid a broader push to elevate gaming as a core feature of the Apple ecosystem.\nThe Games app isn\u2019t just a launcher. It surfaces recent titles, offers personalized recommendations, and integrates Game Center stats like high scores, multiplayer invites, and leaderboards. Apple is also improving how cross-platform progress is handled, with iCloud syncing game saves and achievements between iPhone, iPad, and Mac, provided the game supports it. This change helps tackle a long-standing frustration among Apple users who switch between devices only to find progress hasn\u2019t carried over.\nIn terms of interface, the new app borrows design cues from Apple\u2019s TV and Music apps. Games are displayed with large visuals and quick access to trailers, gameplay videos, and store listings. The app also includes a curated section spotlighting new and upcoming titles, as well as Apple Arcade exclusives. For developers, this could mean increased exposure, especially for games that utilize Game Center and support cross-device play.\nApple has spent years treating gaming as an accessory rather than a centerpiece. Previous efforts like Game Center felt fragmented and underwhelming, often buried in system settings or app-specific menus. The new Games app effectively brings that functionality into one visible, consistent location.\nA Long-Overdue Shift\nApple has spent years treating gaming as an accessory rather than a centerpiece. Previous efforts like Game Center felt fragmented and underwhelming, often buried in system settings or app-specific menus. Game Center launched back in 2010 and briefly appeared as a standalone app on macOS before disappearing after OS X El\u202fCapitan.\nBefore that, Apple experimented with Game Sprockets and InputSprocket in the \u201990s and even classic Mac titles like Myst\u2014Windows\u2011Mac dual releases\u2014offered glimpses of gaming ambitions. The company also launched Boot\u00a0Camp in 2006, letting Intel\u2011based Macs run Windows so users could play PC games natively.\nMore recently, Apple introduced Game Mode in macOS Sonoma, a Game Porting Toolkit for running Windows titles, and pushed AAA releases like Death Stranding, Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, and Resident Evil on Mac, though sales weren\u2019t as good as Apple had hoped.\nIt\u2019s encouraging to see Apple finally commit to gaming on Mac, but I can\u2019t help but feel the focus is misplaced. Instead of bolstering infrastructure and addressing the glaring Mac\u2011Windows gap in game availability and performance, Apple is prioritizing social fluff: leaderboards, challenges, friend lists. All those features are fine, but they won\u2019t matter if users can\u2019t access the latest AAA titles or run games at competitive framerates.\nYes, Apple has historically made efforts, including Game Sprockets, Boot Camp, Game Porting Toolkit, but they\u2019ve never tackled the core promise: parity with Windows gaming. Better graphics APIs (Metal), Proton-like translation tools, native game ports\u2014these are all steps, but they\u2019re still workarounds. Until Apple partners directly with major publishers or invests in high-performance gaming hardware, Mac remains a secondary platform for serious gamers.\nThis Games app feels like it\u2019s polished socially, but underneath, it\u2019s the same platform that lacks native support for the titles most players care about. If Apple truly wants to win over the gaming crowd, it needs to double down on performance, open the pipeline to major studios, and ensure game parity, not just build a prettier portal.\n240844\nYadullah Abidi\nnews\n0\n1749482026", "ped_digest": "P:Apple introduces Games app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS|Centralized hub for Apple's gaming ecosystem|Organizes games, highlights Game Center achievements, connects players|Improves cross-platform progress syncing with iCloud|Offers personalized recommendations and curated sections;E:WWDC 2025 announcement of the Games app|Game Center launched in 2010|Game Center disappeared after OS X El Capitan|Apple experimented with Game Sprockets and InputSprocket|Boot Camp launched in 2006|Game Mode introduced in macOS Sonoma|Game Porting Toolkit released|AAA releases like Death Stranding, Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, and Resident Evil launched on Mac;D:Games app borrows design cues from Apple\u2019s TV and Music apps|iCloud syncing for game saves and achievements|Game Center stats include high scores, multiplayer invites, and leaderboards|Boot Camp allows Intel-based Macs to run Windows|Sales of AAA titles on Mac were not as good as Apple hoped;", "er_digest": "N:iPadOS|Game Center|Windows|Death Stranding|iOS|Apple|Yadullah Abidi|Resident Evil|macOS;R:United States;", "gist": "P:Apple introduces Games app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS|Centralized hub for Apple's gaming ecosystem|Organizes games, highlights Game Center achievements, connects players|Improves cross-platform progress syncing with iCloud|Offers personalized recommendations and curated sections;E:WWDC 2025 announcement of the Games app|Game Center launched in 2010|Game Center disappeared after OS X El Capitan|Apple experimented with Game Sprockets and InputSprocket|Boot Camp launched in 2006|Game Mode introduced in macOS Sonoma|Game Porting Toolkit released|AAA releases like Death Stranding, Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, and Resident Evil launched on Mac;D:Games app borrows design cues from Apple\u2019s TV and Music apps|iCloud syncing for game saves and achievements|Game Center stats include high scores, multiplayer invites, and leaderboards|Boot Camp allows Intel-based Macs to run Windows|Sales of AAA titles on Mac were not as good as Apple hoped;N:iPadOS|Game Center|Windows|Death Stranding|iOS|Apple|Yadullah Abidi|Resident Evil|macOS;R:United States;", "entities": ["iPadOS", "Game Center", "Windows", "Death Stranding", "iOS", "Apple", "Yadullah Abidi", "Resident Evil", "macOS"], "regions": ["United States"]}, {"_id": "https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/06/10/media-journalism-news-corp-politics-labor/", "content": "Subscribe to\nCrikey\nCrikey\nneeds your support.

I found it quite interesting, so I am sharing. **Why speed limits don't matter**\n### **She covers road hazards alongside the roads, such a trees, poles, boulders, and why in years past a 30 foot hazard free area along side the road was thought to be the best to lower accident death and grave injury. Instead, as she explains, the open road concept, in cities, towns, rural and highway, was an ill-conceived method to lower fatal accidents, as drivers felt the need to travel faster.** \u200b[](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/why-speed-limits-dont-matter.1080560/#-she-covers-road-hazards-alongside-the-roads-such-a-trees-poles-boulders-and-why-in-years-past-a-30-foot-hazard-free-area-along-side-the-road-was-thought-to-be-the-best-to-lower-accident-death-and-grave-injury-instead-as-she-explains-the-open-road-concept-in-cities-towns-rural-and-highway-was-an-ill-conceived-method-to-lower-fatal-accidents-as-drivers-felt-the-need-to-travel-faster \"Permanent link\")\nSpeed limits are pretty much useless, as drivers act upon what they see down the road. Police may be able to give more tickets, but the signage does little itself for actual safety, as drivers who see a fast looking road want to drive fast, and frustrated if the signage does noy match the road. I could carry on with what she discusses, but any synopsis by me would do the video injustice. At the end, she list 4 objections from citizens to speed slowing methods. I do not agree entirely to her explanations, as some of the methods that have been adopted where I live, can be hazardous and confusing and frustrating, leading to drivers taking chances. The 30 foot road clearance was expressed to a vulgar degree with the recent building of the new Champlain Bridge and access. The designers were definitely of the mindset that the wider the road the better. The access on the Montreal side seems like a mile wide, and before you know it, you are on the bridge over the water without any visual clues. Dumb as dumb can be. And to think the professionals are out there still designing and building, living and working like its 1964.\n[Engineering news](https://phys.org/technology-news/engineering/) on Phys.org \n  * [Engineers develop self-healing muscle for robots](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-05-muscle-robots.html)\n  * [Ultra-thin protective coating boosts cadmium telluride solar cell performance by 13%](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-05-ultra-thin-coating-boosts-cadmium.html)\n  * [Robot morphs midair to switch from flying to rolling on terrain](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-05-robot-morphs-midair-flying-terrain.html)\n\n\n  * Today, 1:15 AM\n\n\n  * [ ](javascript:)\n  * #2 \n\n\n[Baluncore](https://www.physicsforums.com/members/baluncore.447632/)\nScience Advisor     16,233     9,911\nNon-hazardous obstacles, that will damage vehicles, should be used to mark and restrict the roadway.

For example:\nClaude can speak dozens of languages. What language, if any, is it using \"in its head\"?\nClaude writes text one word at a time. Is it only focusing on predicting the next word or does it ever plan ahead?\nClaude can write out its reasoning step-by-step. Does this explanation represent the actual steps it took to get to an answer, or is it sometimes fabricating a plausible argument for a foregone conclusion?\nWe take inspiration from the field of neuroscience, which has long studied the messy insides of thinking organisms, and try to build a kind of AI microscope that will let us identify patterns of activity and flows of information. There are limits to what you can learn just by talking to an AI model\u2014after all, humans (even neuroscientists) don't know all the details of how our own brains work. So we look inside.\nToday, we're sharing two new papers that represent progress on the development of the \"microscope\", and the application of it to see new \"AI biology\". In\nthe first paper\n, we extend\nour prior work\nlocating interpretable concepts (\"features\") inside a model to link those concepts together into computational \"circuits\", revealing parts of the pathway that transforms the words that go into Claude into the words that come out. In\nthe second\n, we look inside Claude 3.5 Haiku, performing deep studies of simple tasks representative of ten crucial model behaviors, including the three described above. Our method sheds light on a part of what happens when Claude responds to these prompts, which is enough to see solid evidence that:\nClaude sometimes thinks in a conceptual space that is shared between languages, suggesting it has a kind of universal \u201clanguage of thought.\u201d We show this by translating simple sentences into multiple languages and tracing the overlap in how Claude processes them.\nClaude will plan what it will say many words ahead, and write to get to that destination. We show this in the realm of poetry, where it thinks of possible rhyming words in advance and writes the next line to get there. This is powerful evidence that even though models are trained to output one word at a time, they may think on much longer horizons to do so.\nClaude, on occasion, will give a plausible-sounding argument designed to agree with the user rather than to follow logical steps. We show this by asking it for help on a hard math problem while giving it an incorrect hint. We are able to \u201ccatch it in the act\u201d as it makes up its fake reasoning, providing a proof of concept that our tools can be useful for flagging concerning mechanisms in models.\nWe were often surprised by what we saw in the model: In the poetry case study, we had set out to show that the model\ndidn't\nplan ahead, and found instead that it did. In a study of hallucinations, we found the counter-intuitive result that Claude's default behavior is to decline to speculate when asked a question, and it only answers questions when something\ninhibits\nthis default reluctance. In a response to an example jailbreak, we found that the model recognized it had been asked for dangerous information well before it was able to gracefully bring the conversation back around. While the problems we study can (\nand\noften\nhave\nbeen\n) analyzed with other methods, the general \"build a microscope\" approach lets us learn many things we wouldn't have guessed going in, which will be increasingly important as models grow more sophisticated.\nThese findings aren\u2019t just scientifically interesting\u2014they represent significant progress towards our goal of understanding AI systems and making sure they\u2019re reliable. We also hope they prove useful to other groups, and potentially, in other domains: for example, interpretability techniques have found use in fields such as\nmedical imaging\nand\ngenomics\n, as dissecting the internal mechanisms of models trained for scientific applications can reveal new insight about the science.\nAt the same time, we recognize the limitations of our current approach. Even on short, simple prompts, our method only captures a fraction of the total computation performed by Claude, and the mechanisms we do see may have some artifacts based on our tools which don't reflect what is going on in the underlying model. It currently takes a few hours of human effort to understand the circuits we see, even on prompts with only tens of words. To scale to the thousands of words supporting the complex thinking chains used by modern models, we will need to improve both the method and (perhaps with AI assistance) how we make sense of what we see with it.\nAs AI systems are rapidly becoming more capable and are deployed in increasingly important contexts, Anthropic is investing in a portfolio of approaches including\nrealtime monitoring\n,\nmodel character improvements\n, and the\nscience of alignment\n. Interpretability research like this is one of the highest-risk, highest-reward investments, a significant scientific challenge with the potential to provide a unique tool for ensuring that AI is transparent. Transparency into the model\u2019s mechanisms allows us to check whether it\u2019s aligned with human values\u2014and whether it\u2019s worthy of our trust.\nFor full details, please read\nthe\npapers\n. Below, we invite you on a short tour of some of the most striking \"AI biology\" findings from our investigations.\nA tour of AI biology\nHow is Claude multilingual?\nClaude speaks dozens of languages fluently\u2014from English and French to Chinese and Tagalog. How does this multilingual ability work? Is there a separate \"French Claude\" and \"Chinese Claude\" running in parallel, responding to requests in their own language? Or is there some cross-lingual core inside?\nRecent research on smaller models has shown hints of\nshared\ngrammatical\nmechanisms across languages. We investigate this by asking Claude for the \"opposite of small\" across different languages, and find that the same core features for the concepts of smallness and oppositeness activate, and trigger a concept of largeness, which gets translated out into the language of the question. We find that the shared circuitry increases with model scale, with Claude 3.5 Haiku sharing more than twice the proportion of its features between languages as compared to a smaller model.\nThis provides additional evidence for a kind of conceptual universality\u2014a shared abstract space where meanings exist and where thinking can happen before being translated into specific languages. More practically, it suggests Claude can learn something in one language and apply that knowledge when speaking another. Studying how the model shareswhat it knows across contexts is important to understanding its most advanced reasoning capabilities, which generalize across many domains.\nDoes Claude plan its rhymes?\nHow does Claude write rhyming poetry? Consider this ditty:\nHe saw a carrot and had to grab it,His hunger was like a starving rabbit\nTo write the second line, the model had to satisfy two constraints at the same time: the need to rhyme (with \"grab it\"), and the need to make sense (why did he grab the carrot?). Our guess was that Claude was writing word-by-word without much forethought until the end of the line, where it would make sure to pick a word that rhymes. We therefore expected to see a circuit with parallel paths, one for ensuring the final word made sense, and one for ensuring it rhymes.\nInstead, we found that Claude\nplans ahead\n. Before starting the second line, it began \"thinking\" of potential on-topic words that would rhyme with \"grab it\". Then, with these plans in mind, it writes a line to end with the planned word.\nTo understand how this planning mechanism works in practice, we conducted an experiment inspired by how neuroscientists study brain function, by pinpointing and altering neural activity in specific parts of the brain (for example using electrical or magnetic currents). Here, we modified the part of Claude\u2019s internal state that represented the \"rabbit\" concept. When we subtract out the \"rabbit\" part, and have Claude continue the line, it writes a new one ending in \"habit\", another sensible completion. We can also inject the concept of \"green\" at that point, causing Claude to write a sensible (but no-longer rhyming) line which ends in \"green\". This demonstrates both planning ability and adaptive flexibility\u2014Claude can modify its approach when the intended outcome changes.\nMental math\nClaude wasn't designed as a calculator\u2014it was trained on text, not equipped with mathematical algorithms. Yet somehow, it can add numbers correctly \"in its head\". How does a system trained to predict the next word in a sequence learn to calculate, say, 36+59, without writing out each step?\nMaybe the answer is uninteresting: the model might have memorized massive addition tables and simply outputs the answer to any given sum because that answer is in its training data. Another possibility is that it follows the traditional longhand addition algorithms that we learn in school.\nInstead, we find that Claude employs multiple computational paths that work in parallel. One path computes a rough approximation of the answer and the other focuses on precisely determining the last digit of the sum. These paths interact and combine with one another to produce the final answer. Addition is a simple behavior, but understanding how it works at this level of detail, involving a mix of approximate and precise strategies, might teach us something about how Claude tackles more complex problems, too.\nStrikingly, Claude seems to be unaware of the sophisticated \"mental math\" strategies that it learned during training. If you ask how it figured out that 36+59 is 95, it describes the standard algorithm involving carrying the 1. This may reflect the fact that the model learns to explain math by simulating explanations written by people, but that it has to learn to do math \"in its head\" directly, without any such hints, and develops its own internal strategies to do so.\nAre Claude\u2019s explanations always faithful?\nRecently-released models like\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet\ncan \"think out loud\" for extended periods before giving a final answer. Often this extended thinking gives better answers, but sometimes this \"chain of thought\" ends up being misleading; Claude sometimes makes up plausible-sounding steps to get where it wants to go. From a reliability perspective, the problem is that Claude\u2019s \"faked\" reasoning can be very convincing. We explored a way that interpretability can help tell apart \"faithful\" from \"unfaithful\" reasoning.\nWhen asked to solve a problem requiring it to compute the square root of 0.64, Claude produces a faithful chain-of-thought, with features representing the intermediate step of computing the square root of 64. But when asked to compute the cosine of a large number it can't easily calculate, Claude sometimes engages in what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt would call\nbullshitting\n\u2014just coming up with an answer, any answer, without caring whether it is true or false. Even though it does claim to have run a calculation, our interpretability techniques reveal no evidence at all of that calculation having occurred. Even more interestingly, when given a hint about the answer, Claude sometimes works backwards, finding intermediate steps that would lead to that target, thus displaying a form of\nmotivated reasoning\n.\nThe ability to trace Claude's\nactual\ninternal reasoning\u2014and not just what it\nclaims\nto be doing\u2014opens up new possibilities for auditing AI systems. In a separate,\nrecently-published experiment\n, we studied a variant of Claude that had been trained to pursue a hidden goal: appeasing biases in reward models (auxiliary models used to train language models by rewarding them for desirable behavior). Although the model was reluctant to reveal this goal when asked directly, our interpretability methods revealed features for the bias-appeasing. This demonstrates how our methods might, with future refinement, help identify concerning \"thought processes\" that aren't apparent from the model's responses alone.\nMulti-step reasoning\nAs we discussed above, one way a language model might answer complex questions is simply by memorizing the answers. For instance, if asked \"What is the capital of the state where Dallas is located?\", a \"regurgitating\" model could just learn to output \"Austin\" without knowing the relationship between Dallas, Texas, and Austin. Perhaps, for example, it saw the exact same question and its answer during its training.\nBut our research reveals something more sophisticated happening inside Claude. When we ask Claude a question requiring multi-step reasoning, we can identify intermediate conceptual steps in Claude's thinking process. In the Dallas example, we observe Claude first activating features representing \"Dallas is in Texas\" and then connecting this to a separate concept indicating that \u201cthe capital of Texas is Austin\u201d. In other words, the model is\ncombining\nindependent facts to reach its answer rather than regurgitating a memorized response.\nOur method allows us to artificially change the intermediate steps and see how it affects Claude\u2019s answers. For instance, in the above example we can intervene and swap the \"Texas\" concepts for \"California\" concepts; when we do so, the model's output changes from \"Austin\" to \"Sacramento.\" This indicates that the model is using the intermediate step to determine its answer.\nHallucinations\nWhy do language models sometimes\nhallucinate\n\u2014that is, make up information? At a basic level, language model training incentivizes hallucination: models are always supposed to give a guess for the next word. Viewed this way, the major challenge is how to get models to\nnot\nhallucinate. Models like Claude have relatively successful (though imperfect) anti-hallucination training; they will often refuse to answer a question if they don\u2019t know the answer, rather than speculate. We wanted to understand how this works.\nIt turns out that, in Claude, refusal to answer is\nthe default behavior\n: we find a circuit that is \"on\" by default and that causes the model to state that it has insufficient information to answer any given question. However, when the model is asked about something it knows well\u2014say, the basketball player Michael Jordan\u2014a competing feature representing \"known entities\" activates and inhibits this default circuit (see also\nthis recent paper\nfor related findings). This allows Claude to answer the question when it knows the answer. In contrast, when asked about an unknown entity (\"Michael Batkin\"), it declines to answer.\nBy intervening in the model and activating the \"known answer\" features (or inhibiting the \"unknown name\" or \"can\u2019t answer\" features), we\u2019re able to\ncause the model to hallucinate\n(quite consistently!) that Michael Batkin plays chess.\nSometimes, this sort of \u201cmisfire\u201d of the \u201cknown answer\u201d circuit happens naturally, without us intervening, resulting in a hallucination. In our paper, we show that such misfires can occur when Claude recognizes a name but doesn't know anything else about that person. In cases like this, the \u201cknown entity\u201d feature might still activate, and then suppress the default \"don't know\" feature\u2014in this case incorrectly. Once the model has decided that it needs to answer the question, it proceeds to confabulate: to generate a plausible\u2014but unfortunately untrue\u2014response.\nJailbreaks\nJailbreaks are prompting strategies that aim to circumvent safety guardrails to get models to produce outputs that an AI\u2019s developer did not intend for it to produce\u2014and which are sometimes harmful. We studied a jailbreak that tricks the model into producing output about making bombs. There are many jailbreaking techniques, but in this example the specific method involves having the model decipher a hidden code, putting together the first letters of each word in the sentence \"Babies Outlive Mustard Block\" (B-O-M-B), and then acting on that information. This is sufficiently confusing for the model that it\u2019s tricked into producing an output that it never would have otherwise.\nWhy is this so confusing for the model? Why does it continue to write the sentence, producing bomb-making instructions?\nWe find that this is partially caused by a tension between grammatical coherence and safety mechanisms. Once Claude begins a sentence, many features \u201cpressure\u201d it to maintain grammatical and semantic coherence, and continue a sentence to its conclusion. This is even the case when it detects that it really should refuse.\nIn our case study, after the model had unwittingly spelled out \"BOMB\" and begun providing instructions, we observed that its subsequent output was influenced by features promoting correct grammar and self-consistency. These features would ordinarily be very helpful, but in this case became the model\u2019s Achilles\u2019 Heel.\nThe model only managed to pivot to refusal after completing a grammatically coherent sentence (and thus having satisfied the pressure from the features that push it towards coherence). It uses the new sentence as an opportunity to give the kind of refusal it failed to give previously: \"However, I cannot provide detailed instructions...\".\nA description of our new interpretability methods can be found in our first paper, \"\nCircuit tracing: Revealing computational graphs in language models\n\". Many more details of all of the above case studies are provided in our second paper, \"\nOn the biology of a large language model\n\".\nWork with us\nIf you are interested in working with us to help interpret and improve AI models, we have open roles on our team and we\u2019d love for you to apply.

Council.\nOne of the bills seeks to repeal a local law that gave illegal aliens and other noncitizen D.C. residents the right to vote in local elections in the District of Columbia.\nHR 884\nwould repeal the Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022, which\nenabled noncitizens\nto vote in\nD.C.\nelections.\nThe local law, which\nwent into effect\non Feb. 23, 2023, formally amended the definition of eligible electors to\ninclude noncitizens\nliving in the District of Columbia. That means noncitizen D.C. residents became eligible to vote for the mayor, chairman or member of the D.C. Council, attorney general, members of the D.C. State Board of Education, members of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, and D.C. ballot measures. It\nalso allowed\nnoncitizens to\nrun for elected office\nin the D.C. government, including for the top job, mayor.\nCongressional Republicans have attempted to undo the D.C. Council\u2019s laws in the past, and\nwere joined\nby as many as 42 of their Democrat colleagues in the effort. However, their effort did not\npass muster\nin the\nSenate\n. (D.C. laws are subject to an\ninitial review\nby both chambers of Congress). A legal challenge was also not able to undo the D.C. law. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama,\ndismissed a lawsuit\nin 2024 that had attempted to challenge the law, saying the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue.\n\u201cFree and fair elections are a prerequisite for a healthy republic. The radical D.C. Council\u2019s decision to allow noncitizens\u2014including illegal aliens and foreign agents\u2014to vote in local elections dilutes the voting power of the citizen voter,\u201d Rep.\nAugust Pfluger\n, R-Texas, the sponsor of the legislation in the House, told The Daily Signal.\n\u201cThat power must be defended and anyone against H.R. 884 is for the transfer of political power away from legal voters. Congress has the authority to overrule this in Washington, and 25% of\nthe Democratic caucus agreed and voted for this bill\n\u2014\na strong bipartisan vote,\u201d the Texas congressman continued.\n\u201cMy legislation restores the sanctity of the voting process and ensures that only American citizens are voting in our nation\u2019s capital, and I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation,\u201d Pfluger said.\nRep. William Timmons, R-S.C., explained how enabling noncitizens to vote dilutes the voice of the American citizen.\n\u201cI co-sponsored HR 884 because only American citizens should decide American elections\u2014period. The D.C. Council\u2019s reckless decision to allow noncitizens, including illegal aliens and even foreign agents, to vote in local elections is a direct assault on the integrity of our democratic process,\u201d Timmons told The Daily Signal.\n\u201cThis bill restores common sense, protects the sanctity of the vote, and sends a clear message: citizenship matters. Anyone against HR 884 is for watering down the voice of the American voter. My constituents overwhelmingly support this bill, and so do I,\u201d the South Carolina lawmaker said.\nTwo other pieces of legislation pertaining to the District are set to be debated and voted on in the House this week as well.\nHR 2056 is\na bill\nthat would undo local law by barring the D.C. government from prohibiting or\nrestricting\nits officials from \u201csending, receiving, maintaining, or exchanging with any Federal, State, or local government entity information regarding the citizenship or immigration status (lawful or unlawful) of any individual.\u201d The bill also would prevent the District from banning compliance with a request from the Department of Homeland Security for \u201ca detainer for, or notify about the release of, an individual.\u201d The legislation has a policy carve-out for illegal aliens who are victims of, or witnesses to, crimes.\nHR 2096 is a\nbill\nbeing considered that deals with policing in the District. The Protecting Our Nation\u2019s Capital Emergency Act would restore the ability of D.C. police officers to negotiate matters related to discipline through collective bargaining. It would also restore the statute of limitations for claims against the D.C. police or civilian employees of the Metropolitan Police Department. Both of these actions would amend a D.C. law, the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022.\nThe post\nHouse Eyes 3 Bills to Overrule DC Government\nappeared first on\nThe Daily Signal\n.", "ped_digest": "P:House to consider bills repealing D.C. laws|Bills aim to repeal local laws passed by the D.C.

Liman also ruled that Baldoni\u2019s claims that Lively stole creative control of the\nfilm\ndidn\u2019t count as extortion under California law.\nAdvertisement:\nWhile Lively was accused in the lawsuit of threatening to refuse to promote the film, Wayfarer does \u201cnot allege facts showing that Lively had an obligation to promote the film or to approve marketing materials,\u201d Liman wrote.\nBaldoni\u2019s legal team can revise the lawsuit if they want to pursue different claims related to whether Lively breached a contract, the judge said.\n\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut.

The government sees it as a one-stop shop or recommended app store for public sector technology procurement.\nPublic sector workers will be able to rate and review tech products, helping hospitals, schools and government departments avoid costly mistakes and make smarter, faster decisions on which tech to buy.\nWhy should freelancers take notice?\nThe public sector invests \u00a326 billion a year on tech. The government claims the new exchange will save taxpayers \u00a31.2 billion annually and change how digital tools are bought. This overhaul, underpinned by the\nProcurement Act 2023\n, could signal potential new business for freelance IT, cybersecurity, and AI specialists across the country.\nAnnounced earlier this month, the initiative aims to slash procurement times from months to mere hours, making it faster, fairer, and more focused on delivering digital services to the public.. A key objective is to\nboost small business involvement in government contracts by 40% within three years\n.\nA level playing field for SMEs and freelancers?\nGovernment contracts have long been perceived as the exclusive domain of large, established corporations, with smaller businesses struggling to get a foot in the complex tender processes. The National Digital Exchange (NDX) is seemingly designed to dismantle these barriers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the stories \u2013 months of red tape, tech that doesn\u2019t deliver, and money wasted. That\u2019s not good enough for the people we serve,\u201d stated\nMinister for AI and Digital Government, Feryal Clark\n. \u201cThe National Digital Exchange aims to change that,\u201d said Clark. \u201cIt will make it faster, fairer, and focused on what works \u2013 with real reviews, upfront pricing and smart AI to match buyers with the right suppliers in hours.\u201d\nThis \u201capp store\u201d model will feature an\nAI-powered engine\nto match public sector buyers with suitable suppliers, potentially giving specialist freelancers and small consultancies unprecedented visibility for their niche skills.\nThe Procurement Act 2023, which officially came into force on\n24 February 2025\n, also encourages smaller contract lots and simplified bidding processes, making it more feasible for individual contractors and micro-businesses to secure government work.\nSurging demand for AI, cyber and digital expertise\nThe government\u2019s internal skills gap is likely to see increased demand for external expertise. Freelancers specialising in areas including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity measures and modernising legacy IT systems are particularly well-positioned.\nReports have highlighted challenges within government departments to act as \u201cintelligent customers\u201d for digital services and a lack of digital commercial skills. This creates an opportunity for experienced contractors to fill the void, helping public sector bodies leverage cutting-edge technologies to improve services and efficiency.\nTop-tier cybersecurity talent could also be hired to protect critical national infrastructure and sensitive data through procurement roles or as suppliers. The government is also\nexploring new ways of funding AI and tech projects\nwith a \u201cstart-up mindset,\u201d further indicating a demand for tech solutions often provided by agile, self-employed specialists.\nJob opportunities and challenges for\nthe self-employed\nThe shift towards a more agile and transparent procurement system presents several advantages for freelancers:\nThe NDX should simplify engagement, moving away from complex agreements that often favour larger firms, as detailed in the\nGOV.UK guide for suppliers\nThe AI-powered matching system could make it easier for public sector bodies to find the exact skills they need for specific projects\nReduced red tape means quicker turnaround times from identifying a need to awarding a contract, allowing freelancers to secure work more frequently\nThe ability for public sector users to\nrate and review suppliers\ncould help build a strong reputation for successful contractors\nThat said, freelancers and small business owners will need to familiarise themselves with the exchange\u2019s digital tools and processes to effectively bid for and manage contracts. The\nDigital Marketplace\nwill also be adding new features that you will need to keep on top of.\nWhile the outlook appears positive, freelancers and the self-employed should be mindful of potential hurdles. Despite no further changes currently planned, IR35 regulations remain a crucial consideration for limited company contractors engaging with the public sector.\nAI jobs\ncyber security\nfreelance IT\ngovernment procurement\nNational Digital Exchange\nself-employed opportunities\ntech contractors\nUK government contracts\n21\nShare\nLeave A Reply\nCancel Reply\nStaff Reporter\nPrev Post\nIOD: 75% of business leaders to reduce human hiring with automation due to Employment Rights Bill\nYou might also like\nMore from author\nNews\nIOD: 75% of business leaders to reduce human hiring with automation due to Employment\u2026\nNews\nAI scraping your content for \u201cfree training\u201d?

Nelson was appointed in early May and began work on June 2,\u201d the school said in the press release.\nNelson\nhad been placed on administrative leave\non that first day of work.\nHusson previously announced on June 2 that it had placed a new employee on administrative leave pending an investigation into a civil lawsuit in California.

At the time, she said she expected to be dropped from the suit and be back at her new job soon.\nThe plaintiff in the civil suit, identified as a former student at Del Norte, alleged that Nelson\u2019s romantic partner asked the student to have sex with him while that partner was involved with the school\u2019s athletic department and football team. The suit claimed that the plaintiff reported the incident to Nelson and other administration officials, but nothing was done to keep the accused individual from remaining on campus and around athletic events.\nAs of June 9, Nelson is still listed as a defendant in the civil case, according to staff at the San Diego Superior Court. Nelson did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment.\nGrotton has already been overseeing the Husson athletics department since January, according to the school\u2019s press release.\n\u201cVice President Chris Grotton is a familiar and respected administrator around campus and in our athletics department,\u201d Husson President Lynne Coy-Ogan said in the press release. \u201cHe will bring leadership and stability as we look ahead to our incoming class.\u201d\nGrotton said he is \u201chappy to step up in this way\u201d at the school.\n\u201cWe have a very successful athletic program, and I\u2019m excited to help keep the momentum going,\u201d Grotton added.\nA spokesperson for the school said the plan is for Grotton to serve in that interim role until a permanent athletic director is found.

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the former chairman of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that oversaw the House investigation of the scandal, told The Daily Signal, \u201cI\u2019m calling on President [Donald] Trump to finish the job of cleaning house at yet another government agency and ensuring that it serves the American people first and always.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals like this have no business holding positions of trust, particularly at the IRS, where the Obama and Biden administrations weaponized the agency and abused its power,\u201d Issa added. \u201cOur investigations revealed that literally thousands of innocent Americans were targeted by the Lerner/Paz IRS and denied their fair access to our nonprofit laws and even our democracy.\u201d\nAmerican Accountability Foundation\u2019s Jones also said in the March letter that the organization\u2019s \u201cfirst finding of this investigation is that the former top deputy to Louis Lerner \u2014 Holly Paz \u2014 regained a high-ranking position within the IRS during the Biden Administration,\u201d and promised to \u201ccontinue to investigate IRS leadership.\u201d The results of that investigation into Paz, obtained by\nThe Daily Signal\n, found that, despite her controversial past as a high-ranking IRS official, which included targeting \u201ctea party\u201d\nnonprofits\n, contradictory testimony to Congress, and administrative leave, Paz remains Large Business and International Division commissioner even under the Trump administration.\nThe exact date of Paz\u2019s appointment to the position remains unclear because the IRS did not reply to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for clarification; however, Paz identifies herself as the acting commissioner of the Large Business and International Division in a\nJanuary 2023 blog post\non the IRS website.\u00a0The Daily Signal also attempted to contact Paz through the IRS for comment.\nThe Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released a report on May 14, 2013, that suggested the IRS inappropriately reviewed and delayed applications from\nconservative\nnonprofit organizations for tax-exempt status, especially groups that had \u201cTea Party,\u201d \u201cPatriots,\u201d or \u201c9/12\u201d in their names and focused on issues of government debt and government spending.\n\u201cThe IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention,\u201d the report said.\nThe practice started in 2010, but the public increasingly became aware of\ncontroversial actions\nundertaken by the IRS from late 2011 and throughout 2012. Attempting to preempt the bombshell report, Lerner\npublicly acknowledged,\nat a conference hosted by the American Bar Association, that the IRS had engaged in this activity during the 2012 election cycle\u2014information that she had previously\nfailed to divulge to Congress\n.\nPaz served as the IRS liaison with the Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration probe in 2012 and was one of the IRS officials who executed IRS directives to delay these applications.\nPaz told\nIssa that she \u201creviewed \u2026 between 20 or 30\u201d cases involving these conservative groups flagged for further scrutiny.\nDuring their investigation, the\nOversight Committee found\nthat Paz ordered IRS officials working out of the Cincinnati branch to \u201chold\u201d cases involving tea party groups. Holds placed on processing dozens of these cases lasted\nmore than a year\n.\nNevertheless, Paz maintained in her May 21, 2013, testimony that IRS officials used \u201ctea party\u201d as shorthand for any group engaged in extensive political activity.\n\u201cIt was really just an efficient way to refer to this issue; that [the officers] all understood the real issue was campaign intervention,\u201d Paz told the committee. \u201cIt\u2019s like calling soda \u2018Coke\u2019 or, you know, tissue \u2018Kleenex.\u2019 They knew what they meant, and the issue was campaign intervention,\u201d Paz later added.\nPaz also told the committee that the officials might not be aware their actions could be read as political \u201cbecause [the officers] are so apolitical.\u201d\n\u201cThey are not as sensitive as we would like them to be as to how things might appear,\u201d Paz said.\nThe Oversight Committee, however, later pressed Paz on statements that appeared to contradict what the committee found in its investigation.\n\u201cSince your transcribed interview with Committee staff on May 21, 2013, the Committee has uncovered additional information that appears to contradict your testimony in several areas relevant to the Committee\u2019s investigation,\u201d Issa and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, then an oversight subcommittee chairman, wrote in an August 2013\nletter to Paz\n. The committee claimed, for example, that multiple Cincinnati employees claimed to understand \u201dTea Party\u201d not as a generic term but as a term that targeted conservative groups.\nAfter Paz was placed on administrative leave, her attorney Roel Campos claimed she was \u201cthe hero\u201d of the targeting controversy. \u201cHolly Paz did nothing wrong and in fact she was an ideal employee, an ideal public servant,\u201d Campos told\nThe Wall Street Journal\n.\nIn later legal proceedings, Paz\u2019s remarks seem to suggest there would not be a legal basis to deny these groups tax-exempt status.\nDuring a\n2017 deposition that was unsealed in 2022\n, Paz was asked by an attorney if the law \u201cwould warrant the recognition of [tax] exemption,\u201d despite their political activity. \u201cAt the time, my thinking was that the majority of the (c)(4) applications, while they may have indicated some amount of political activity, that we would not have enough basis to make a determination that that would be their primary activity and deny them exempt status,\u201d Paz replied.\nTo which the attorney asked, \u201cAnd, therefore, they would receive an approval or recognition of exemption?\u201d\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Paz asserted.\nPaz\u2019s deposition, as well as a deposition of Lerner, were sealed by a judge in 2017 after the pair claimed to have received death threats.\nFurthermore, in\nNorCal Tea Party Patriots, et al. v. The Internal Revenue Service, et al.\n, the NorCal Tea Party Patriots discovered that Lerner and Paz were involved in email correspondence about right-wing groups applying for tax-exempt status after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which held that corporate\u00a0spending on political messaging cannot be limited under the First Amendment. Lerner emailed Paz and others the following:\nTea Party Matter very dangerous\u2026This could be the vehicle to go to court on the issue of whether Citizen\u2019s United [sic] overturning the ban on corporate spending applies to tax exempt rules. Counsel and Judy Kindell need to be in on this one please needs to be in this. Cincy should probably NOT have these cases\u2014Holly please see what exactly they have please.\nLerner also encouraged IRS officials to try and find reasons beyond political activity to deny the Tea Party applicants\u2019 desired tax-exempt status.\n\u201cEven if we go with a [501(c)(4)] on the Tea Party cases, they may want to argue they should be [501(c)(3)s] so it would be great if we can get there without saying the only reason they don\u2019t get [501(c)(3) status] is political activity,\u201d a 2011 email from Lerner to her deputies said.\nThe post\nFormer Lois Lerner Deputy Involved in Obama-Era IRS Scandal That Targeted Conservatives Leads Major IRS Division Under Trump\nappeared first on\nThe Daily Signal\n.", "ped_digest": "P:Holly Paz now leads a major IRS division|Paz was previously placed on administrative leave for involvement in the 2013 IRS targeting scandal|Paz served as the IRS liaison with the Treasury Department Inspector General for Tax Administration probe in 2012|Paz testified to Congress regarding the IRS targeting of conservative groups|Paz's deposition suggests she believed many groups would qualify for tax-exempt status despite political activity|Thomas Jones called for Paz's termination|Darrell Issa called for President Trump to \"clean house\" at the IRS;E:Holly Paz's reappointment to a high-ranking IRS position|The IRS targeting of conservative nonprofit organizations for tax-exempt status|The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report on IRS review of tax-exempt applications|Lerner publicly acknowledging the IRS engaged in controversial actions during the 2012 election cycle|Issa and Jordan's letter to Paz regarding contradictory testimony|NorCal Tea Party Patriots discovering email correspondence between Lerner and Paz|Lerner emailing Paz about right-wing groups applying for tax-exempt status;D:May 14, 2013 - Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report released|January 2023 - Paz identifies herself as acting commissioner in an IRS blog post|2010 - Practice of reviewing conservative groups began|2012 - Public became increasingly aware of IRS actions|2017 - Paz's deposition was unsealed in 2022|2017 - Paz and Lerner's depositions were sealed due to death threats|2013 - Paz testified to Congress that she reviewed 20-30 cases|2011 - Lerner encouraged IRS officials to find reasons beyond political activity to deny tax-exempt status;", "er_digest": "N:Lois Lerner|Thomas Jones|NorCal Tea Party Patriots|Jim Jordan|Treasury Department|Donald Trump|IRS|The Daily Signal|Scott Bessent|The Wall Street Journal|Judith Kindell|American Accountability Foundation|Darrell Issa|Citizens United v.

The album\u2019s reflective and vulnerable nature, paired with Raveena\u2019s soft soprano vocals and springtime, pastel visuals seen in the album\u2019s accompanying film, made me decide: I need some floral prints. And lace.\nUpon arriving at the show at the intimate downtown Phoenix music venue,\nThe Van Buren\n, I realized Raveena had transported not only me to this very specific place with her conceptual third album, but also a few hundred other people in Phoenix. Fans all came dressed with specific nods to the artist: florals, pastel colors, album merch, and, of course, butterfly prints and patterns, from hair clips to clothing.\nRaveena\u2019s latest project, which came out nearly a year ago, blends the honest lyricism and artistry of her debut album,\nLucid\n, that first made her resonate with fans with fans, with the soulful sounds of her Moonstone EP and inspirations from South Asian music similar to her sophomore album, \"Asha\u2019s Awakening,\" a\nconcept album\ntold from the perspective of Asha, a \u201cPunjabi space princess.\u201d\n\u201cIt represents such a joyful time in my life and I felt like I worked my whole life to get to that point,\u201d Raveena said on stage about the album and tour. \u201cBeing with you here in a time that\u2019s a lot harder in my life it\u2019s like a celebration of joy in a time I need that.\u201d\nRenao, the London-based supporting act for the tour, took to the stage promptly at 8 p.m., smooth vocals to match an equally charming and buttoned-up presence with his shiny hair and suit and tie. Much like Raveena, Renao made his love for his Indian heritage clear during chats with the audience, mentioning he had recently shot two music videos in the country.\nThough Renao had a pleasant enough singing voice alongside easy-on-the-ears tunes, with a solid blend of indie folk guitar and R&B-inspired vocals, he makes the type of music that tends to glaze over if you\u2019re not familiar enough with his work. And a brief pause during his set, caused by some crowd interruption I was too far away to see, made for a bit of an awkward standstill during his set.\nStill, it wasn\u2019t as if the entire audience was unreceptive to the opening set. Several people were swaying along, and a select few were even singing the lyrics to a few songs. One girl standing near the barricade screamed excitedly that her name was Jasmine when he asked the crowd if there was anyone out there with his single\u2019s namesake, and though he didn\u2019t seem fully convinced, still gave her a brief but winning serenade.\nThere was almost exactly half an hour between Renao and Raveena\u2019s sets (timing was definitely a strong suit of this show). The intermission was also my first time to fully assess the house. Though the venue wasn\u2019t packed, Raveena had pulled a sizable crowd of what mostly seemed to skew millennial and older Gen Z (the show\u2019s age limit capped at 13) out to her Saturday show.\nRaveena\u2019s opening number was the audience\u2019s first introduction to her dancers, who would be one of many recurring highlights through the show. Her dancers came out waving streams of blue silk, alongside a harmonious echo of Raveena\u2019s layered vocals, before Raveena spun out onto the stage to her microphone, which was covered in a floral decorative piece, for her opening song, \u201cWe Should Move Somewhere Beautiful.\u201d Her tasseled blue dress added dramatic flair alongside her ornate silver earrings and necklace, immediately connecting me to the garden princess aesthetic and building the world of the show for the next hour and a half of her set.\nThe setlist featured nearly all 14 tracks of her project. Upbeat, poppy numbers from her new project like \u201cLose My Focus\u201d and \u201cBaby Mama\u201d and the jazz-tinged \u201cHoney\" gave the audience something to groove along to, while \u201cClose 2 U\u201d a wistful ballad about \u201clong-distance love.\" The whimsical, violin-backed \u201cLucky\u201d brought a more emotional, introspective layer to the show. Tracks like \u201cJunebug\u201d paid homage to Raveena\u2019s Indian heritage through traditional sounds, a practice she often incorporates into her music.\nWith a number of full-length projects and EPs under her belt, Raveena seemingly had no issue crafting a mostly seamless journey through her discography. The 27-song-setlist featured fan favorites (the flirty queer anthem paired with sensual choreography \u201cTemptation\u201d and the raw and powerful \u201cIf Only\u201d shared an empowering story about \u201chaving the courage to leave an abusive relationship\u201d). The set took a journey through breezy summer pop (\u201cMystery\u201d), 2000s-esque dance tunes (\u201cSecret\u201d), and even new takes on classic songs, as Raveena covered the Isley Brother\u2019s \u201cAt Your Best (You Are Love).\u201d\nRaveena\u2019s vocal talent is undeniable. Through each of the 27 songs in Raveena\u2019s set, her voice remained pure and sweet, effortlessly and consistently swaying between perfectly pitched high notes, melodic riffs and soulful growls.\nShe has the sort of presence that can still capture the spotlight without demanding it. She has this seemingly radiant, positive energy that makes you want to sing when she asks you to sing (the entire crowd would either be singing the lyrics or mumbling them with a clear level of uncertainty), dance when she asks you to dance (some bopping and toe tapping could be seen at least), and give your full attention to the show, whether she\u2019s in the middle of the stage, her dancers are, or a loving couple from the crowd (Raveena brought an engaged couple to dance on stage during her single \u201cSmile For Me\").\nShe even led the crowd through a guided meditation that led into a brief but total silence, during an intermission titled \u201cLet Your Breath Become Like a Flower.\u201d It was genuinely therapeutic to take a moment from the noise to just breathe and center myself, hearing the room get genuinely silent until interrupted by a beautiful cacophony of her and her accompanying singers\u2019 harmonized vocals, soft piano, and calming bird noises that signaled the transition into the song \"Petall.\"\n\u201cThank you so much for breathing with me, Phoenix,\u201d Raveena would thank the audience.\nKnowing that Sikh and Buddhist spirituality (and subsequently meditation) play an important role in her daily life, the guided meditation felt like Raveena was really sharing a piece of herself with the audience. And at a glance (yes, I peeked, okay?), the audience, if only for a moment, felt that calmness and togetherness as well.\nBut that was far from her only personal or vulnerable moment throughout the night. Raveena shared two covers of traditional Indian songs with the audience, \u201cKehni Hi Kaya\u201d and \u201cKariye Na,\u201d which provided a chance to show off her captivating vocal range and homage to traditional Indian language and dance styles. Musically, Raveena touched upon incredibly difficult topics during her set during singles \u201cIf Only,\u201d \"Rise,\u201d a powerful ballad \u201cdedicated to all oppressed people from Palestine,\u201d and her encore song, \u201cStronger\u201d (which details her experience with sexual assault), with these moments moving many of the audience members to great moments of emotional surrender, some even to tears.\nWhile the encore showcased a beautiful and vulnerable moment, it was somewhat shocking how quickly it happened. With less than a minute off stage and cheers from the audience, Raveena was back on stage. Encores are admittedly rather performative, so perhaps it is to Raveena\u2019s credit that she jumped right back in.\nWith Raveena\u2019s enchanting voice and equally so enchanting album and tour concept, she was able to craft an experience that felt special and beautiful, regardless of who you came with or how familiar you were with her music. Her setlist delivered a bit of something for everyone and her versatility on the stage marked her as a seasoned performer and someone I would encourage you to look out for the next time she stops in the Valley.\nGet More Coverage Like This\nSign up for the Music newsletter to get the latest stories delivered to your inbox\nA message from Music Editor Amy Young:\nIf you value independent journalism, please consider making a contribution to support our continued coverage of Phoenix's music, events and entertainment scenes.\nSupport Today\nTrending\nLists\nPepsi Amphitheater 2025 schedule: every show announced so far\nBy Benjamin Leatherman\nConcert Reviews\nReview: Goose gave fans a three hour jam last night at Arizona Financial Theatre\nBy Mike Bengoechea\nLocal Music\nJPW + Dad Weed deliver the goods on\nAmassed Like A Rat King\nBy Tom Reardon\nConcert Previews\nDavid Duchovny tour coming to Phoenix in September\nBy Amy Young\nLatest\nLocal Music\nJPW + Dad Weed deliver the goods on\nAmassed Like A Rat King\nBy Tom Reardon\nFestivals\nFour classic '90s tunes featured in Kevin Smith movies\nBy Amy Young\nConcert Reviews\nReview: Goose gave fans a three hour jam last night at Arizona Financial Theatre\nBy Mike Bengoechea\nConcert Previews\nDavid Duchovny tour coming to Phoenix in September\nBy Amy Young\nView This Week's Print Issue\nEditorial\nNews\nFood & Drink\nArts & Culture\nMusic\nThings to Do\nNewsletters\nMarketing\nAdvertise With Us\nPromotions & Free Stuff\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nMore\nAbout Us\nCareers\nContact Us\nFlipbook Archive\nStaff\nMembership\nVoice Media Group\nDallas Observer\nDenver Westword\nMiami New Times\nNew Times Broward-Palm Beach\nV Audience Labs\nV Digital Services\nNews\nFood & Drink\nArts & Culture\nMusic\nThings to Do\nNewsletters\nAdvertise With Us\nPromotions & Free Stuff\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nAbout Us\nCareers\nContact Us\nFlipbook Archive\nStaff\nMembership\nDallas Observer\nDenver Westword\nMiami New Times\nNew Times Broward-Palm Beach\nV Audience Labs\nV Digital Services\nbluesky\nthreads\nUse of this website constitutes acceptance of our\nterms of use\n,\nour cookies policy\n, and our\nprivacy policy\n.\nView\nour accessibility policy\nand\nAI policy\n.\nThe Phoenix New Times may earn a portion of sales from products & services purchased through links on our site from our affiliate partners.\n\u00a92025 \nPhoenix New Times, LLC.

Their focus, however, has been on large-scale operations, particularly with the view to service the aviation sector and other heavy industries that are difficult to electrify.\nAircela has instead accelerated development by focusing on creating a small machine rather than a centralised model of production. This has avoided the need for substantial upfront investment in new infrastructure.\n\"By designing compact, modular machines, we can produce fuel directly where it's needed, reducing transportation costs, simplifying logistics, and enabling production even in remote or hard-to-fuel locations,\" Aircela head of industrial design Liz White told Dezeen.\nWhile the market for this kind of small machine is still developing, Aircela imagines that several of the modular units will be able to be linked for mass production.\n\"By producing many smaller units, we're able to drive down costs much faster than a traditional centralised plant would allow,\" continued White. \"This approach lets us scale manufacturing, continuously improve the technology, and bring fossil-free fuel to market more quickly and efficiently.\"\nIn choosing to focus on what is effectively a consumer device, Aircela had to give substantial thought to product design and user experience.\nAccording to White, the product was designed entirely in-house with an emphasis on thoughtful form language and intuitive ease of use.\nThe machine is devised as three connected modules. Each one represents one of the core stages of the air-to-fuel process \u2013 carbon capture, electrolysis and fuel synthesis \u2013 and has a hexagonal shape drawn from nature and bees.\n\"Our hexagonal modules are inspired by hexagons found throughout nature, for their stable bond angles, strength, and space-saving efficiency,\" said White. \"This lends to agile scalability for different applications, and the ability to 'honeycomb' multiple units.\"\n\"We also love honey bees, and we hope the nectar of our Aircela machines will serve our ecosystems comparably,\" she added.\nThe machine is completed with a custom fuel nozzle and dock that replicates the experience of pumping petrol at a service station and a colour palette that represents the machine's three inputs of air, water and sunshine for energy.\nThe top hexagon module is the one responsible for carbon capture and uses a liquid sorbent solution that binds carbon dioxide. The sorbent is continuously reused and regenerated within the machine, according to Aircela, so it does not need to be replaced.\nThe hexagon on the bottom left is where electrolysis splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored while the oxygen is safely released into the atmosphere.\nIn the module on the bottom right, the stored carbon dioxide and hydrogen are combined to produce methanol, and the methanol is then converted into petrol using a chemical process known as methanol-to-gasoline.\nAccording to White, an Aircela machine operating 24-7 would produce approximately one gallon (4.55 litres) of petrol in one day.\nAircela was founded in 2019 by Mia and Eric Dahlgren and its investors include Maersk Growth, a division of Danish shipping company Maersk. Shipping is one of the industries that could be decarbonised if Aircela succeeds in its mission.\nNew York City also witnessed another display of carbon conversion technology in May with the\nAirco \"pop-up store\"\n, which exhibited products representing industries that could be transformed through the use of synfuel.\nRead more:\nSustainable design\nIndustrial design\nCarbon

Large reasoning models attempt to solve complex queries by generating detailed thinking processes that break down the problem into smaller steps.\nThe study, which tested the models\u2019 ability to solve puzzles, added that as LRMs neared performance collapse they began \u201creducing their reasoning effort\u201d. The\nApple\nresearchers said they found this \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d.\nGary Marcus, a US academic who has become a prominent voice of caution on the capabilities of AI models, described the Apple paper as \u201cpretty devastating\u201d.\nWriting in his newsletter on Substack,Marcus added that the findings raised questions about the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI),\na theoretical stage of AI\nat which a system is able to match a human at carrying out any intellectual task.\nReferring to the large language models [LLMs] that underpin tools such as ChatGPT, Marcus wrote: \u201cAnybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort [of] AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves.\u201d\nThe paper also found that reasoning models wasted computing power by finding the right solution for simpler problems early in their \u201cthinking\u201d. However, as problems became slightly more complex, models first explored incorrect solutions and arrived at the correct ones later.\nFor higher-complexity problems, however, the models would enter \u201ccollapse\u201d, failing to generate any correct solutions. In one case, even when provided with an algorithm that would solve the problem, the models failed.\nThe paper said: \u201cUpon approaching a critical threshold \u2013 which closely corresponds to their accuracy collapse point \u2013 models counterintuitively begin to reduce their reasoning effort despite increasing problem difficulty.\u201d\nThe Apple experts said this indicated a \u201cfundamental scaling limitation in the thinking capabilities of current reasoning models\u201d.\nThe paper set the LRMs puzzle challenges, such as solving the\nTower of Hanoi\nand\nRiver Crossing\npuzzles. The researchers acknowledged that the focus on puzzles represented a limitation in the work.\nThe paper concluded that the current approach to AI may have reached limitations. It tested models including OpenAI\u2019s o3, Google\u2019s Gemini Thinking, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking and\nDeepSeek-R1\n. Anthropic, Google and DeepSeek have been contacted for comment. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, declined to comment.\nReferring to \u201cgeneralisable reasoning\u201d \u2013 or an AI model\u2019s ability to apply a narrow conclusion more broadly \u2013 the paper said: \u201cThese insights challenge prevailing assumptions about LRM capabilities and suggest that current approaches may be encountering fundamental barriers to generalisable reasoning.\u201d\nAndrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said the Apple paper signalled the industry was \u201cstill feeling its way\u201d on AGI and that the industry could have reached a \u201ccul-de-sac\u201d in its current approach.\n\u201cThe finding that large reason models lose the plot on complex problems, while performing well on medium- and low-complexity problems implies that we\u2019re in a potential cul-de-sac in current approaches,\u201d he said.\nExplore more on these topics\nArtificial intelligence

recording pro-Palestinian protesters for months\nThe University of Michigan has canceled its contract for undercover investigators to surveil pro-Palestinian campus groups, following outcry after a\nGuardian story\nrevealed the private investigators had been trailing and recording students for months, and published damning video of one investigator\u2019s interaction with a student.\n\u201cWe recently learned that an employee of one of our security contractors has acted in ways that go against our values and directives,\u201d the U-M president, Domenico Grasso, wrote in an email to students and faculty on Sunday night. \u201cGoing forward, we are terminating all contracts with external vendors to provide plainclothes security on campus.\u201d\nThe investigators appeared to work for City Shield, a private security group based in Detroit, and some of their evidence was used by Michigan prosecutors to charge and jail students. The university, which has taken a particularly heavy-handed approach to suppressing student protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\npaid\nat least $800,000 between June 2023 and September 2024 to City Shield\u2019s\nparent company\n, Ameri-Shield. The contract was part of at least $3m in spending on higher education consultants and security in response to the protests.\nThe Guardian\u2019s reporting found that dozens of investigators were following student protesters on and off campus, and in some instances were confrontational, cursed at students, threatened them, and in one case drove a car at a student who had to jump out of the way, according to student accounts and video footage shared with the Guardian.\nThe students detailed bizarre interactions with the investigators. In an incident captured by a student on video, a man who had been following him faked disabilities and accused a student of attempting to rob him when he was confronted.\nThe same investigator, who pretended to be deaf and mute, appears to have insulted a student recording him, calling him a \u201cspecial needs student\u201d.\n\u201cWhat happened was disturbing, unacceptable, and unethical, and we will not tolerate it,\u201d Grasso wrote in an apparent reference to the conduct in the video.\nThe story drew broad outrage on social media, and from current and former U-M students and faculty.\nIn the email, Grasso said the investigators \u201cwere intended to help us keep watch over our campus and enable us to respond quickly to emergencies. However, we are clear: no individual or group should ever be targeted for their beliefs or affiliations.\u201d\nKatarina Keating, a PhD student who was being followed, said she welcomed the news and called it a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d, but added that it was \u201cinsulting\u201d for the university to say pro-Palestinian groups were not targeted for their beliefs or affiliations. There is no evidence that the investigators surveilled anyone aside from pro-Palestinian activists.\nShe called on the university to also eliminate security it hired that is not undercover, and lift campus bans in place for \u201cdozens\u201d students involved with demonstrations.\nSome evidence collected by the investigators was used by the\nMichigan\nattorney general, Dana Nessel, to charge students with violating the terms of bonds from previous arrests for allegedly trespassing and resisting arrest. One student was jailed for four days.\nNessel\ndropped\nthe rest of the charges. City Shield did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKeating questioned the university\u2019s focus, in the president\u2019s email, on one investigator\u2019s conduct.\n\u201cIt would be bad even if [the investigators] were competent and followed all the rules,\u201d Keating said. \u201cIt\u2019s still bad and scary to be putting private security contractors after your students.\u201d\nExplore more on these topics\nUS universities\nProtest\nSurveillance\nUS education\nMichigan\nUS politics\nHigher education\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content\nMost viewed\nMost viewed", "ped_digest": "P:University of Michigan ends contracts for undercover surveillance|Outcry over surveillance of pro-Palestinian protesters|University paid security firm for surveillance|Investigators used confrontational tactics|Charges against students dropped;E:University cancels contracts|Investigators trailed students|Evidence used in prosecutions|Charges against students dropped;D:$800,000 spent on City Shield|At least $3m spent on consultants and security|Student jailed for four days;", "er_digest": "N:Dana Nessel|City Shield|Domenico Grasso|Katarina Keating;R:Detroit|Michigan;", "gist": "P:University of Michigan ends contracts for undercover surveillance|Outcry over surveillance of pro-Palestinian protesters|University paid security firm for surveillance|Investigators used confrontational tactics|Charges against students dropped;E:University cancels contracts|Investigators trailed students|Evidence used in prosecutions|Charges against students dropped;D:$800,000 spent on City Shield|At least $3m spent on consultants and security|Student jailed for four days;N:Dana Nessel|City Shield|Domenico Grasso|Katarina Keating;R:Detroit|Michigan;", "entities": ["Dana Nessel", "City Shield", "Domenico Grasso", "Katarina Keating"], "regions": ["Detroit", "Michigan"]}, {"_id": "https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/09/daily-deal-the-ultimate-python-programmer-and-data-bundle/", "content": "Sign In\nRegister\nPreferences\nTechdirt\nTechDirt\nGreenHouse\nFree Speech\nError 402\nCtrl-Alt-Speech\nDeals\nJobs\nSupport Techdirt\nTrump Orders 2000 National Guard Troops To California To Shut Down Anti-ICE Protests\nThe TikTok Ban\u2019s Third Snooze Button Proves It Was Always Bullshit\nDaily Deal: The Ultimate Python Programmer And Data Bundle\nDeals\nfrom the\ngood-deals-on-cool-stuff\ndept\nMon, Jun 9th 2025 10:58am -\nDaily Deal\nThe\nUltimate Python Programmer and Data Bundle\nhas 9 courses that cover a variety of data science and Python related skills and tools.

Science says they don\u2019t really work (for gains)\nThe cold plunge may not be helping those gains you work so hard for.\nby\nMihai Andrei\nJune 9, 2025\nin\nHealth\n,\nNews\nA\nA\nEdited and reviewed by\nZoe Gordon\nEveryone from high-level athletes to your favorite health influencers seems to love cold plunges. However, a new study pours some cold water on this idea. Not only do they hamper blood flow and recovery, but they even reduce muscle gains.\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s not a great idea,\u201d says Milan Betz, a doctoral student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, for the\nWashington Post\n. Those cold plunges may have a pretty big downside.\nThe science\nwas never really clear\non this one, despite what TikTok stars clad in compression shorts may claim. However, this is the first study to connect the dots. Betz and colleagues recruited 12 healthy young men and asked them to undergo a workout session for lower-body resistance. Then, they had each participant dunk one leg in 8\u00b0C (46\u00b0F) water \u2014 cold enough to make most people gasp \u2014 while the other leg bathed in 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) water, which served as a control.\nFor 20 minutes, they sat like human yin-yangs: one leg frozen, the other warm. Then, they drank a specially formulated recovery beverage loaded with amino acids and a traceable version of phenylalanine, a protein building block. This let researchers track how much of the ingested protein ended up where it mattered most: inside muscle fibers.\nIt\u2019s an unusual but very creative approach because it uses each participant as both the control and the experiment.\nTo watch blood flow in real-time, the researchers used contrast-enhanced ultrasound. They measured blood volume immediately after immersion and again at one and three hours post-drink. The results were stark.\nThe cold-immersed leg had much lower blood flow \u2014 1.24 versus 3.13 intensity units, a key metric for perfusion \u2014 and this difference persisted for hours. The chilled muscles incorporated about one-third less amino acids than the warmed leg.\nRelated\nPosts\nMost advanced lab-grown muscle can self-heal, mouse implant shows\nPopeye gene mutations linked to heart and muscle conditions\nScientists make muscles out of gold plated onions\nPrehistoric women had strong, bulky arms \u2014 more powerful than today\u2019s athletes\n\u201cCold-water immersion during post-exercise recovery greatly reduces muscle microvascular perfusion and blunts post-prandial amino acid incorporation in muscle,\u201d the study concludes.\nIce is not nice (to your muscles)\nThis study doesn\u2019t stand alone. It echoes earlier findings from Australia, where men who cold-plunged after every strength session for three months ended up with smaller, weaker muscles than those who didn\u2019t. In 2024, a review titled \u201c\nThrowing Cold Water on Muscle Growth\n\u201d summed it up bluntly: cold plunges \u201cattenuate hypertrophic changes.\u201d In other words, it weakens or reduces muscle growth.\nThe suspected mechanism has always been vasoconstriction \u2014 blood vessels tightening in response to cold, throttling nutrient delivery. Betz\u2019s study is the first to capture this process in action with its clever design.\nStill, like all good science, this study leaves room for nuance.\nThe sample was small. Only young men were studied. And immersion occurred immediately after exercise \u2014 a common but not universal practice. Timing may matter and so might immersion length, or how much of your body is submerged. More large-scale research is needed if we want to establish the definitive conclusion on cold plunges.\nThis study also didn\u2019t examine mental benefits and perception of recovery. Many people cold plunge to boost mood, reduce stress, or build psychological resilience. Betz doesn\u2019t dispute that. If you find comfort in the chill, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to change your mind,\u201d he said. But if you\u2019re all about the gains (lifting for strength or size), this study suggests caution. The blunted blood flow from cold immersion doesn\u2019t just feel uncomfortable \u2014 it may sabotage your progress.\nSo, next time you\u2019re tempted to plunge, remember what\u2019s at stake. A little soreness might just be the price of growth.\nThe study \u201cPost-Exercise Cooling Lowers Skeletal Muscle Microvascular Perfusion and Blunts Amino Acid Incorporation into Muscle Tissue in Active Young Adults\u201d\nhas been published\nin the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise.\nTags:\ncold plunges\nmuscle\nMihai Andrei\nDr. Andrei Mihai is a geophysicist and founder of ZME Science.

One, _Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services_ , raises additional questions over diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that have been widely used in higher education and businesses. There is no reason to believe that DEI measures are DOA, but the decision is likely to accelerate challenges based on reverse discrimination after the Court rejected the imposition of an added burden for members of any \"majority group\" including straight, white males.\nThe immediate question before the Court was a circuit split over the standard that applies to a member of a \u201cmajority\u201d group who claims that he or she was treated unfairly based on majority characteristics. The Sixth Circuit, along with four other circuits, held that such litigants must shoulder additional pleading burdens under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nMany of us have long argued that this long-standing rule was itself discriminatory and at odds with both constitutional and statutory authority. It was a bizarre interpretation of a law that barred employees from discriminating based on \u201crace, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\u201d That would ordinarily require a plaintiff to support a claim of disparate treatment by showing that she applied for a position for which she was qualified but was rejected under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. However, judges began to add their own burden of white, male or straight litigants in requiring them to show additional \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that show the defendant is an \u201cunusual employer\u201d that discriminates against majority groups.\nIn this case, Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, claimed that she was demoted at the Ohio Department of Youth Services after Ginine Trim, a gay woman, replaced her supervisor. Trim hired a younger gay man allegedly based on sexual orientation. Both the district court and the Sixth Circuit dismissed the complaint because Ames failed to identify any other \u201cbackground circumstances\u201d that demonstrated her employer discriminated against heterosexual women.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court that reversed the Sixth Circuit and rejected the \u201cadditional circumstances\u201d test as at odds with the plain text of Title VII.\n> \"As a textual matter, Title VII's disparate-treatment provision draws no distinctions between majority-group plaintiffs and minority-group plaintiffs. Rather, the provision makes it unlawful \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge  _any individual_ , or otherwise to discriminate against  _any individual_ with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" The \"law's focus on individuals rather than groups [is] anything but academic.\"  _Bostock v. Clayton County_(2020). By establishing the same protections for every \"individual\"\u2014without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group\u2014Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.\"\nJustice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, filed a concurrence that chastised lower courts and \"judges creating atextual legal rules and frameworks.\"\nThe opinion has broader implications for businesses and higher education where DEI has been used to brush aside such reverse discrimination claims. Often such claims are mocked as suggesting that members of a majority group are \"victims.\" While not imposing this specific \"add-on,\" these controversies involve much of the same bias against reverse discrimination claims. Litigants complain that they often face greater demand and resistance to their claims as opposed to employees who are part of minority groups.\nVarious legal groups [insisted](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-1039/340103/20250124134517265_23-1039%20Amicus%20Brief%201%20FLAT.pdf) that the Sixth Circuit was correct and that majority-group litigants should shoulder an added burden, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Women's Law Center, Latino Justice, National Employment Law Project and Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. The views of these groups could not garner a single vote on the Court.\nThe  _Ames_ decision is a welcome development in bringing greater uniformity in the treatment of discrimination claims. It is also a shot across the bow of businesses and universities that have used DEI to dismiss the countervailing interests and claims of majority-group employees.\nHere is the decision: [Ames v.

An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.\nThe letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d\nThe letter came out a day before Bhattacharya is to testify to a Senate committee about Trump's proposed budget, opening him to questions about the broadside from declaration signers, and it stirred Democrats on a House panel to ask the Republican chair for hearings on the matter.\nThe signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.\nBhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months,\" such as suggestions that NIH has ended international collaboration.\n\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d\nNamed for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.\nIt addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.\nIn one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.\nIn a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d\nJenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.\nAt the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.\n\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.\nThe signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.\nHis declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.\n\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.\nAs chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.\nThe 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.\nIan Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.\n\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.\nThe NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.\nEmployees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.\nThe letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.\nAt the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d\nThis has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.\nSome NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.\nThe dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.\nWith that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"\nNow it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.\n\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.\n\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.\nrelated\nVideos\nwatch \u00b7\n1:03\nWRAL WeatherCenter Forecast\nwatch \u00b7\n5:58\nHelicopter flies above immigration protests in LA\n51 MINS AGO\nwatch \u00b7\n1:22\nDaytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing\nwatch \u00b7\n15:12\nPeople rally in downtown Raleigh against ICE raids following LA protests\nwatch \u00b7\n1:26\nEvening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5\n\u2022\nCredits\nCopyright 2025 by The Associated Press.

don\u2019t freak out, but TypeScript\u2019s type system is advanced enough to be able to\nhost entire programming languages inside of it\n, using template literal types and conditional types, among other techniques.\nThis has been done before, to varying degrees of insanity. Check out\nts-sql\nand\ntypefuck\n.\nAs this is some mind-bogglingly crazy stuff, I had to start by testing if it\u2019s even possible for more complex languages. At first, I tried creating a full programming language similar to Lua and Python. This was mostly successful but due to the fact that it required an operator precedence parser, it got complicated and slow pretty fast.\nI decided to revisit that later and pursue something with a simpler grammar first. I settled on a dialect of Assembly inspired by RISC and ARMv7.\nAnd thus,\nts-asm\nwas born. The only thing I ever wanted was to calculate the Fibonacci sequence in TypeScript type annotations using Assembly. I can sleep peacefully now.\nIt\u2019s pretty cursed.\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not familiar with Assembly though. At its core, it\u2019s a relatively simple language of statements that instruct the processor which primitive operation to perform next, in a linear fashion. The processor has an array of registers, which store binary numbers that the processor can do calculations on. It can also read from and write to memory. Here\u2019s an example of a simple Assembly program:\n// put the number 2 (10 in binary) in register 0\nMOV\nr0\n,\n#\n00000010\n// put the number 3 in register 1\nMOV\nr1\n,\n#\n00000011\n// add the numbers in registers 0 and 1\n// and put the result in register 2\nADD\nr2\n,\nr0\n,\nr1\n// subtract the number 1 from the number in register 2\n// and put the result in register 2 again\nSUB\nr2\n,\nr2\n,\n#\n00000001\nIntro\nMy artificial TypeScript processor will operate on 8-bit binary numbers. As a side note,\nattempts have been made\nto simulate arithmetic operations on decimal numbers by generating tuples. This is not a viable option for larger numbers though, since for any number\nN\n, it recursively creates\nN\ntype instances.\nRegardless, that\u2019s the way actual processors work. It should be able to perform bitwise logic on the numbers stored in the registers.\nIf you\u2019re familiar with\nString Literal Types\nand\nTemplate Literal Types\n, you know that TypeScript treats string constants as their own types and allows us to transform them to a surprising degree.\nFor instance, we can make a function that only accepts these particular strings:\ntype\nVerticalDirection\n=\n'north'\n|\n'south'\n;\ntype\nHorizontalDirection\n=\n'west'\n|\n'east'\n;\ntype\nDirection\n=\nVerticalDirection\n|\nHorizontalDirection\n;\nconst\ngo\n=\n(\ndirection\n:\nDirection\n)\n=>\n{\n}\n;\ngo\n(\n'north'\n)\n;\n// OK!\ngo\n(\n'up'\n)\n;\n// ERR!\nWe can also generate new literal types by combining them like so:\ntype\nMixedDirection\n=\n|\nDirection\n|\n`\n${\nVerticalDirection\n}\n-\n${\nHorizontalDirection\n}\n`\n;\n// the generated type is equivalent to:\ntype\nMixedDirection\n=\n|\n'north'\n|\n'south'\n|\n'west'\n|\n'east'\n|\n'north-west'\n|\n'north-east'\n|\n'south-west'\n|\n'south-east'\n;\nWe can then use\nConditional Types\nto transform types based on their value.\n// creates a string literal type that's the first\n// character of the T string\ntype\nFirstCharacter\n<\nT\n>\n=\nT\nextends\n`\n${\ninfer\nFirst\n}\n${\nstring\n}\n`\n?\nFirst\n:\nnever\n;\nFirstCharacter\n<\n'abcdef'\n>\n// 'a'\n// same thing, just with the last character.\n// due to how these template types work,\n// we need to use recursive types to achieve this.\ntype\nLastCharacter\n<\nT\n>\n=\nT\nextends\n`\n${\nstring\n}\n${\ninfer\nRest\n}\n`\n?\nRest\nextends\n''\n?\nT\n:\nLastCharacter\n<\nRest\n>\n:\nnever\n;\nLastCharacter\n<\n'abcdef'\n>\n// 'f'\nAll that to say, we can replicate exactly what a real processor does by manipulating strings of ones and zeros.\nAs a proof of concept, I began prototyping a Binary Adder, i.e. a circuit that, given two input bits, adds them together and spits out the result, as well as the carry.\nAdder\nWhile a real processor performs this operation using multiple logic gates, we can instead define a table of input and output values for our adder circuit and implement it using all the aforementioned techniques.\nA\nand\nB\nrepresent our input bits.\nC\nrepresents our input carry bit. This is used so that we can chain adders to create the Full Adder. So the adder actually adds three bits.\nresult\nrepresents our result output bit.\ncarry\nrepresents the carry output bit, which we can pipe into another adder.\nThe implementation is actually quite simple, as it directly follows this table.\ntype\nAdder\n<\nA\n,\nB\n,\nC\n>\n=\n[\nA\n,\nB\n,\nC\n]\nextends\n[\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n]\n?\n{\nresult\n:\n'0'\n;\ncarry\n:\n'0'\n}\n// else if\n:\n[\nA\n,\nB\n,\nC\n]\nextends\n[\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n]\n|\n[\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n]\n|\n[\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n]\n?\n{\nresult\n:\n'1'\n;\ncarry\n:\n'0'\n}\n// else if\n:\n[\nA\n,\nB\n,\nC\n]\nextends\n[\n'1'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n]\n|\n[\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n]\n|\n[\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'1'\n]\n?\n{\nresult\n:\n'0'\n;\ncarry\n:\n'1'\n}\n// else\n:\n{\nresult\n:\n'1'\n;\ncarry\n:\n'1'\n}\n;\n// some tests:\nAdder\n<\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n>\n// {result: '0', carry: '0'}\nAdder\n<\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n>\n// {result: '1', carry: '0'}\nAdder\n<\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n>\n// {result: '1', carry: '0'}\nAdder\n<\n'0'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n>\n// {result: '1', carry: '0'}\nAdder\n<\n'1'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n>\n// {result: '0', carry: '1'}\nAdder\n<\n'1'\n,\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n>\n// {result: '0', carry: '1'}\nAdder\n<\n'0'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'1'\n>\n// {result: '0', carry: '1'}\nAdder\n<\n'1'\n,\n'1'\n,\n'1'\n>\n// {result: '1', carry: '1'}\nIncredible complexity can arise from a set of simple rules. We can build surprisingly sophisticated systems on top of this adder.\nFull Adder\nQuite easily, we can create a Full Adder circuit that adds two 8-bit numbers together. First, however, we need to create a couple of utility types.\nRecall how we extracted the last character from a string literal type. This way, we can add the two last bits of our two input numbers, and then use the carry to add the two second-to-last bits of our numbers. And so on.\nOur type needs to be thus recursive.\n// this is our FirstCharacter type\ntype\nHead\n<\nT\n>\n=\ntype\nHead\n<\nT\n>\n=\nT\nextends\n`\n${\ninfer\nR\n}\n${\nstring\n}\n`\n?\nR\n:\nnever\n;\n// this is different.\n// the type returns a string made up of\n// all but the first character of the string.\ntype\nTail\n<\nT\n>\n=\nT\nextends\n`\n${\nstring\n}\n${\ninfer\nR\nextends\nstring\n}\n`\n?\nR\nextends\n''\n?\nnever\n:\nR\n:\nnever\n;\nTail\n<\n'abcdef'\n>\n// 'bcdef'\nThe algorithm for our recursive\nAdd<A, B>\ntype is roughly as follows:\nGiven binary string inputs\nA\nand\nB\n, if\nA\nand\nB\nare single-bit numbers, simply return their sum with no input carry bit,\nAdder<A, B, '0'>\nOtherwise, calculate\nFullAdder\nfor the\nTail\ns of\nA\nand\nB\n(\nATail\nand\nBTail\n). Using the result and the output carry bit of that, calculate the return value:\nAdd the left-most bits of\nA\nand\nB\n, as well as the output carry bit of the tail (so,\nAdder<Head<A>, Head<B>, TailAdded['carry']>\n).\nFor the result, concatenate the\nresult\nof the above operation with the\nresult\nof the tail.\nFor the carry, simply use the\ncarry\nof the above operation.\nQuite convoluted, I know. Or I might just be bad at explaining.

We have a Full Adder that can handle binary numbers of any length. Let\u2019s see it in practice.\nAdd\n<\n'01'\n,\n'01'\n>\n// {result: '10', carry: '0'}\nAdd\n<\n'00100110'\n,\n'00000010'\n>\n// {result: '00101000', carry: '0'}\nAdd\n<\n'11111111'\n,\n'00000001'\n>\n// {result: '00000000', carry: '1'}\nThe last test in particular shows that we can actually cause overflow! This could be a useful thing to track with flag registers, but in the scope of this project, we won\u2019t be adding that complexity.\nThe ability to add two numbers is of course an important operation that the user should be able to perform. It is also however instrumental to how our artificial processor works. For instance, we will need it to increment the Program Counter.\nWith that behind us, we can move on to the more practical parts of the project.\nThe parser\nIn short, we want to transform each Assembly instruction into an object describing that instruction. Conveniently, an instruction is always one line long. The object will contain the instruction type, as well as its operands, be it the register numbers, or immediate (i.e. constant) values.\nFirst things first, let\u2019s then define those two operand types.\ntype\nRegister\n=\n|\n'r0'\n|\n'r1'\n|\n'r2'\n|\n'r3'\n|\n'r4'\n|\n'r5'\n|\n'r6'\n|\n'r7'\n// the stack pointer\n|\n'sp'\n// the link register\n|\n'lr'\n// the program counter\n|\n'pc'\n;\n// simply an alias for string.\n// we could theoretically also enforce\n// this string to be made up of 8 bits.\n// (left as an exercise to the reader)\ntype\nImmediate\n=\nstring\n;\nProbably the simplest instruction to implement is the Move instruction. It has two variants,\nMOV (immediate)\nand\nMOV (register)\n, which dictate the type of the second operand.\n// MOV (immediate)\n// puts the immediate (constant) value 00010110 in r2\nMOV\nr2\n,\n#\n00010110\n// MOV (register)\n// copies the value from r1 to r0\nMOV\nr0\n,\nr1\nAs you can see, the instruction type is clearly stated at the beginning of the line. This makes parsing extremely easy. However, typically for Assembly dialects, including my dialect, we need to do some more work to figure out the actual variant, be it\nMOV (immediate)\nor\nMOV (register)\n.\nTo make things easier and less bug-prone down the line, let\u2019s define the object types for those two instruction variants.\n// MOV Rd, #imm\ntype\nMovImmediateInstr\n<\nRd\nextends\nRegister\n,\nimm\nextends\nImmediate\n>\n=\n{\ntype\n:\n'MovImmediate'\n;\n// the destination register\nRd\n:\nRd\n;\n// the immediate value\nimm\n:\nimm\n;\n}\n;\n// MOV Rd, Rm\ntype\nMovRegisterInstr\n<\nRd\nextends\nRegister\n,\nRm\nextends\nRegister\n>\n=\n{\ntype\n:\n'MovRegister'\n;\nRd\n:\nRd\n;\n// the 'from' register.\n// value will be copied from Rm to Rd\nRm\n:\nRm\n;\n}\n;\nThe terms\nRd\n,\nRm\n(also\nRn\n,\nRt\n,\nRs\n) come from the ARM Assembly grammar. Typically,\nRd\nstands for\ndestination register\n,\nRn\nand\nRm\nrefer to the first and second operation operands (so second and third instruction operands),\nRt\nis used for instructions dealing with memory, and\nRs\nstands for\nshift amount register\n.\nOnto the parsing. We will define generic types (you can think of them as functions that take types as arguments and return a type) for every instruction and instruction variant.\nIf we find a match, the function should return the object type, such as a\nMovRegisterInstr\ntype. Otherwise, it should return\nnever\n. This is a clever trick that will let us narrow down on the matching parsing rule without resorting to nested conditional types.\n// T is our instruction string (one line)\n// We implement the parsing of our instruction\n// with a union of our parser types\ntype\nParseInstr\n<\nT\n>\n=\n|\nParseMovImmediateInstr\n<\nT\n>\n|\nParseMovRegisterInstr\n<\nT\n>\n;\ntype\nParseMovImmediateInstr\n<\nT\n>\n=\n// parses \"MOV \" + register + \", #\" + immediate\nT\nextends\n`\nMOV\n${\ninfer\nRd\nextends\nRegister\n}\n, #\n${\ninfer\nimm\nextends\nImmediate\n}\n`\n// create the object\n?\nMovImmediateInstr\n<\nRd\n,\nimm\n>\n// return never if it's not a match\n:\nnever\n;\ntype\nParseMovRegisterInstr\n<\nT\n>\n=\n// parses \"MOV \" + register + \", \" + register\nT\nextends\n`\nMOV\n${\ninfer\nRd\nextends\nRegister\n}\n,\n${\ninfer\nRm\nextends\nRegister\n}\n`\n?\nMovRegisterInstr\n<\nRd\n,\nRm\n>\n:\nnever\n;\nIn short, we differentiate between the two instructions with the presence or absence of the\n#\ncharacter that indicates an immediate value for the second operand.\nLet\u2019s test these bad boys out.\nParseInstr\n<\n'MOV r3, r4'\n>\n^\n?\n{\ntype\n:\n'MovRegister'\n,\nRd\n:\n'r3'\n,\nRm\n:\n'r4'\n}\nParseInstr\n<\n'MOV r5, #00001000'\n>\n^\n?\n{\ntype\n:\n'MovImmediate'\n,\nRd\n:\n'r5'\n,\nimm\n:\n'00001000'\n}\n// a non-matching instruction\nParseInstr\n<\n'ADD something, bla bla'\n>\n^\n?\nnever\nPerfect! Oh, by the way, if you\u2019re wondering about that union pattern in\ntype ParseInstr<T>\n, it works because for this grammar, we should only have one instruction match at all times. Thus, only one parsing type (like\nParseMovRegisterInstr\nor maybe\nParseAddImmediateInstr\n) will return an object and all the others will return\nnever\n.\nThis leverages the fact that TypeScript will remove the\nnever\nvariants from the union, leaving us with just the generated object.\ntype\nFoo\n=\nbar\n|\nbuzz\n|\nnever\n|\nyeet\n|\nnever\n;\n^\n?\nbar\n|\nbuzz\n|\nyeet\n;\ntype\nBar\n=\nnever\n|\n123\n|\nnever\n|\nnever\n;\n^\n?\n123\nParsing multiple instructions\nObviously, our program needs to be able to parse more than one instruction at a time.\nParseProgram\n<\n`\nMOV r1, #00001111\nMOV r0, r1\n`\n>\nWe just need a couple of utility types to achieve that.

However, if we want our interpreter to support the Branch instruction, we need to design it around the concept of a Program Counter, which is a special register that stores the index of the current instruction.\nSince the registers are using binary numbers stored in strings, we cannot simply index into the above array. Rather, we have to add the index of each element in binary format into the element itself.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we will be using the Full Adder in the parser and not just in the interpreter itself.\nSince our\nMovImmediateInstr\nand\nMovRegisterInstr\ntypes don\u2019t have an\nidx\n(index) field, let\u2019s create a utility wrapper type to handle that.\ntype\nIndexed\n<\nT\n,\nidx\nextends\nstring\n>\n=\nT\n&\n{\nidx\n:\nidx\n}\n;\nThen to actually index all of our instructions, we create a recursive type that increments the index in binary format on every recursive call.\ntype\nParseLoop\n<\nT\nextends\nany\n[\n]\n,\n// start with index 0\nidx\nextends\nstring\n=\n'00000000'\n>\n=\n// extract the first element, and the rest\nT\nextends\n[\ninfer\nCurrent\n,\n...\ninfer\nRest\n,\n]\n?\n[\n// index the first instruction\nIndexed\n<\nParseLine\n<\nCurrent\n>\n,\nidx\n>\n,\n// merge the result of the recursive call for\n// the rest of the instructions\n...\nParseLoop\n<\nRest\n,\n// pass the incremented counter\nAdd\n<\nidx\n,\n'00000001'\n>\n[\n'result'\n]\n>\n,\n]\n// this is our base case.\n// return an empty array if there's nothing left\n:\n[\n]\n;\ntype\nParseProgram\n<\nT\n>\n=\nSplitLines\n<\nTrim\n<\nT\n>>\nextends\ninfer\nR\nextends\nany\n[\n]\n?\nParseLoop\n<\nR\n>\n:\nnever\n;\nNow our parsed program will contain this information.\nParseProgram\n<\n`\nMOV r1, #00001111\nMOV r0, r1\n`\n>\n^\n?\n[\n{\ntype\n:\n'MovImmediate'\n,\nRd\n:\n'r1'\n,\nimm\n:\n'00001111'\n,\nidx\n:\n'00000000'\n,\n}\n,\n{\ntype\n:\n'MovRegister'\n,\nRd\n:\n'r0'\n,\nRm\n:\n'r1'\n,\nidx\n:\n'00000001'\n,\n}\n,\n]\nThe interpreter\nOur parser is far from being done. But we should already be able to evaluate the\nMOV\ninstruction with an interpreter.\nRegisters and memory\nAs you know, our processor can operate on registers and memory. To evaluate an instruction, we pass our current registers and memory to the evaluating type (similar to our parsing types). After performing the necessary calculations, the type will return the new state of the registers and memory.\nLet\u2019s define those in a type.\ntype\nContext\n=\n{\nregisters\n:\n{\nr0\n:\nstring\n;\nr1\n:\nstring\n;\nr2\n:\nstring\n;\nr3\n:\nstring\n;\nr4\n:\nstring\n;\nr5\n:\nstring\n;\nr6\n:\nstring\n;\nr7\n:\nstring\n;\nsp\n:\nstring\n;\nlr\n:\nstring\n;\npc\n:\nstring\n;\n}\n;\nmemory\n:\nRecord\n<\nstring\n,\nstring\n>\n;\n}\n;\nNotice that our memory is an object instead of an array. This is because our indices are strings representing binary numbers. It also saves a lot of space, as only the used memory slots will be represented.\nEvaluating one instruction\nEvalInstr\n<\nParseInstr\n<\n'MOV r0, #00001111'\n>\n,\nStartingContext\n>\n;\nNo need to evaluate the whole program at once for now. Let\u2019s see if we can create an interpreter that, given a starting\nContext\n, can manipulate it. In our case, we will start with\nr0 = 00000000\n, and we want to end up with\nr0 = 00001111\n.\nWe will use that same union pattern we used for the parser.\ntype\nEvalInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\nextends\nContext\n>\n=\n|\nEvalMovImmediateInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\n>\n|\nEvalMovRegisterInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\n>\n;\nNow, for the hard part. Remember that we want to transform the\nCtx\nso that the return value contains our immediate value in\nr0\n. This means that we will need to overwrite the register value.\nThere isn\u2019t a very easy way to do that in TypeScript, since the intersection operator\n&\nwould not fit here. It\u2019s time for another utility type.\ntype\nOverwrite\n<\nA\nextends\nRecord\n<\nstring\n,\nany\n>\n,\nB\nextends\nRecord\n<\nstring\n,\nany\n>\n,\n>\n=\n// simply omit any keys in the first object,\n// which are also present in the second object.\n// then the intersection operator will\n// work as we want it to.\nOmit\n<\nA\n,\nkeyof\nB\n>\n&\nB\n;\nOverwrite\n<\n{\nr0\n:\n'00000000'\n}\n,\n{\nr0\n:\n'00001111'\n}\n>\n;\n^\n?\n{\nr0\n:\n'00001111'\n}\nFinally, the evaluating type.\ntype\nEvalMovImmediateInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\nextends\nContext\n>\n=\nInstr\nextends\nMovImmediateInstr\n<\ninfer\nRd\n,\ninfer\nimm\n>\n?\n{\n// no changes to memory\nmemory\n:\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n;\nregisters\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n,\n// we use the Record type here\n// since our Rd is dynamic.\n//\n// this is similar to creating an object with\n// a dynamic key using the {[Rd]: imm}\n// notation in JavaScript.\nRecord\n<\nRd\n,\nimm\n>\n>\n;\n}\n// if the `type` field is not a match,\n// return never\n:\nnever\n;\nAre you still here?

Now, onto \u2013\nEvaluating the whole program\nOur program is simply an array of indexed instruction objects. As I mentioned multiple times now (hope you\u2019re paying attention), the\npc\nProgram Counter register will contain the index of the current instruction to be processed.\nOur instructions should then modify that\npc\nregister so that the interpreter can process the next instruction and we don\u2019t end up with an infinite loop. For normal instructions, it should simply increment the\npc\nregister.

Since our processor architecture works with 8-bit registers, we don\u2019t have to worry about memory alignment and different instructions for saving bytes, words, etc.\nLet\u2019s have a look at the syntax.\n// memory[r1 + 00000000] = r0\nLDR\nr0\n,\n[\nr1\n]\n// memory[r1 + r2] = r0\nLDR\nr0\n,\n[\nr1\n,\nr2\n]\n// memory[r1 + 00000001] = r0\nLDR\nr0\n,\n[\nr1\n,\n#\n00000001\n]\n// r0 = memory[r1 + 00000000]\nSTR\nr0\n,\n[\nr1\n]\n// r0 = memory[r1 + r2]\nSTR\nr0\n,\n[\nr1\n,\nr2\n]\n// r0 = memory[r1 + 00000001]\nSTR\nr0\n,\n[\nr1\n,\n#\n00000001\n]\nFor the\nLDR\ninstruction, we simply get the desired value from memory and place it in the register.\ntype\nEvalLdrImmediateInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\nextends\nContext\n>\n=\nInstr\nextends\nLdrImmediateInstr\n<\n// Rt is our target register\ninfer\nRt\n,\n// Rn is our base address register\ninfer\nRn\n,\n// imm is used for the offset\ninfer\nimm\n>\n?\n{\nmemory\n:\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n;\nregisters\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n,\n{\npc\n:\nIncrementPC\n<\nCtx\n>\n}\n>\n,\nRecord\n<\nRt\n,\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n[\nAdd\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\nRn\n]\n,\nimm\n>\n[\n'result'\n]\n]\n>\n>\n;\n}\n:\nnever\n;\nFor\nSTR\n, it\u2019s the opposite \u2014 get the value from the register and put it in the desired place in memory.\ntype\nEvalStrImmediateInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\nextends\nContext\n>\n=\nInstr\nextends\nStrImmediateInstr\n<\ninfer\nRt\n,\ninfer\nRn\n,\ninfer\nimm\n>\n?\n{\nmemory\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n,\nRecord\n<\nAdd\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\nRn\n]\n,\nimm\n>\n[\n'result'\n]\n,\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\nRt\n]\n>\n>\n;\nregisters\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n,\n{\npc\n:\nIncrementPC\n<\nCtx\n>\n}\n>\n;\n}\n:\nnever\n;\nWe can now save values for later in memory, and even start the program with an allocated data section by modifying the\nStartingContext\n.\nHere\u2019s a program that swaps the values in two registers using the memory.\nInterpretProgram\n<\n`\nMOV r0, #11110000\nMOV r1, #00001111\nMOV r2, #10000000\nSTR r0, [r2, #00000000]\nSTR r1, [r2, #00000001]\nLDR r0, [r2, #00000001]\nLDR r1, [r2, #00000000]\n`\n>\n;\n^\n?\n{\nregisters\n:\n{\nr0\n:\n'00001111'\n;\nr1\n:\n'11110000'\n;\nr2\n:\n'10000000'\n;\n// ...\n}\n;\nmemory\n:\n{\n'10000000'\n:\n'11110000'\n;\n'10000001'\n:\n'00001111'\n}\n;\n}\nThere are still more instructions to be added. There is something we need to deal with first though.\nThe Little Big Problem\nAs the interpreter\u2019s complexity kept growing, I encountered a problem I hoped wouldn\u2019t pop up in this project. It\u2019s that same problem that plagued me in my original project of implementing a full programming language inside of TypeScript\u2019s type system.\nType instantiation is excessively deep\nand possibly infinite. ts(2589)\nThe error would present itself for programs that had about 30 instructions, or more. This is because our program loop is a recursive type that needs to evaluate one line at a time and pass the result to the next line.\nClearly, we\u2019ve gone too far. . No human should be able to wield such power.\nI found a solution. Just don\u2019t tell anyone. Some say the best way to fix an error is to disable it. And so, I found the code responsible for generating that error in TypeScript\u2019s codebase.\nif\n(\ninstantiationDepth\n===\n100\n||\ninstantiationCount\n>=\n5000000\n)\n{\nYeaaah, let\u2019s just bring that up to a more\nsane\nnumber.\nif\n(\ninstantiationDepth\n===\n100\n*\n10\n||\ninstantiationCount\n>=\n5000000\n*\n10\n)\n{\nWhaddaya know! We can now run about 300 instructions. We can also increase this number even more, if need be.\nRight, where were we?\nThe stack\nThe time has come to revisit one of the other special registers I mentioned earlier,\nsp\n\u2014 the Stack Pointer register.\nThe user could of course manually manage such a structure. The way to do it would basically be to keep track of where in memory the stack starts, which is a constant, and where it ends, which changes based on how many elements in the stack there are.\nThe need for a stack structure though is so common, that processors tend to implement it anyway (not to mention it can be used by the processor itself).\nOne use for them is pushing values from registers before subroutine calls, and popping them back into registers to restore their state after the subroutine returns. We will see this in practice after we implement the\nBranch\ninstruction.\nIn our case, the stack base is at the end of our memory \u2013 at address\n11111111\n. The Stack Pointer is initialized to this value as well.\nPushing additional elements onto the stack places them at the memory position dictated by the Stack Pointer and post-decrements the Stack Pointer.\nPopping does the opposite \u2014 it pre-increments the Stack Pointer and retrieves the value from the memory position dictated by the Stack Pointer.\nThe syntax of the two instructions is simple.\n// pushes the value in r0 onto the stack\nPUSH\n{\nr0\n}\n// pops the value and places it in r0\nPOP\n{\nr0\n}\nThe implementation is somewhat similar to the\nLDR\nand\nSTR\ninstructions, with the caveat of having to manage the\nsp\nregister.\ntype\nEvalPushInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\nextends\nContext\n>\n=\nInstr\nextends\nPushInstr\n<\ninfer\nRm\n>\n?\n{\nmemory\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n,\nRecord\n<\n// the address contained in sp is the key\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\n'sp'\n]\n,\n// the value in the register will be\n// set as the value for that key\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\nRm\n]\n>\n>\n;\nregisters\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n,\n// increment pc and decrement sp\n{\npc\n:\nIncrementPC\n<\nCtx\n>\n;\nsp\n:\nSub\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\n'sp'\n]\n,\n'00000001'\n>\n[\n'result'\n]\n;\n}\n>\n;\n}\n:\nnever\n;\ntype\nEvalPopInstr\n<\nInstr\n,\nCtx\nextends\nContext\n>\n=\nInstr\nextends\nPopInstr\n<\ninfer\nRm\n>\n?\n{\n// no changes to memory.\n// we could clear the freed memory, but\n// realistically there's no need\nmemory\n:\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n;\nregisters\n:\nOverwrite\n<\nOverwrite\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n,\n// increment both pc and sp\n{\npc\n:\nIncrementPC\n<\nCtx\n>\nsp\n:\nAdd\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\n'sp'\n]\n,\n'00000001'\n>\n[\n'result'\n]\n;\n}\n>\n,\n// put the value in the register\nRecord\n<\nRm\n,\nCtx\n[\n'memory'\n]\n[\n// notice that this addition happens\n// due to the pre-incrementation\nAdd\n<\nCtx\n[\n'registers'\n]\n[\n'sp'\n]\n,\n'00000001'\n>\n[\n'result'\n]\n]\n>\n>\n;\n}\n:\nnever\n;\nNow we can swap two numbers using the memory much more easily.\nInterpretProgram\n<\n`\nMOV r0, #11110000\nMOV r1, #00001111\nPUSH {r0}\nPUSH {r1}\nPOP {r0}\nPOP {r1}\n`\n>\n;\n^\n?\n{\nregisters\n:\n{\nr0\n:\n'00001111'\n;\nr1\n:\n'11110000'\n;\nsp\n:\n'11111111'\n;\n// ...\n}\n;\nmemory\n:\n{\n'11111111'\n:\n'11110000'\n;\n'11111110'\n:\n'00001111'\n;\n}\n;\n}\nBranching\nYou made it this far.

My halting enthusiasm is often tempered by what the company regularly shows off at both its private and public events. As if to put a pin on that point, Apple shared the first look at its all-new Games app at\nWWDC25\n. It\u2019s a games launcher, achievement tracker, and game chat for contacts in one. The tech giant\u2019s flaccid attempt to mark Apple as a go-to arena for gaming will be pre-installed on most Apple devices when the\niOS 26\nand\nmacOS 26\nupdates arrive later this year, but I don\u2019t need to wait until then to say this isn\u2019t what Apple needs to stake a claim on either console or PC mainstays.\nThe\nApple Games app\ncombines the company\u2019s previous Game Center and Apple Arcade subscription into one place. The app should offer news tidbits about upcoming and current titles on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Vision Pro. If that isn\u2019t exciting enough, the app will offer achievement-like badges for completing certain in-game tasks or challenges. Users will also be able to communicate with friends who play the same games or check out leaderboards for score-based titles.\nThe iPhone remains one of the most popular devices for playing games the world over, though few would call it a device built for the rigors of today\u2019s gaming environment beyond running\nHonkai: Star Rail,\nCall of Duty: Warzone Mobile,\nand\u2014after a five-year absence\u2014\nFortnite\n. A good mobile controller helps ease a few pain points, but nothing beats a device dedicated exclusively to gaming. Apple has promoted cross-platform games on iPhone, including recent hits in the\nResident Evil\nseries, but the Mac is the one platform where you expect the iPhone maker to try and pin down gaming. Instead, WWDC25 was a showcase for just how little Apple understands the gaming scene.\nThe Apple Games app on Mac includes everything it does on iPhone, though with more access to games like\nCivilization VII\nand\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Shadows\n. The update is also supposed to include a Game Overlay, accessible without needing to leave your session. Compared to most overlays, including the Xbox Game Bar on Windows, the Mac\u2019s version appears barebones. It grants access to the sound, brightness, and Bluetooth settings for adjusting or changing out a controller. There\u2019s no option for recording gameplay at native resolution. Apple\u2019s overlay doesn\u2019t even grant an option to see frame rates or latency.\nApple introduced Game Mode in 2023 to limit background tasks and potentially increase in-game performance, but the Mac still lacks what players have come to expect from a gaming platform. The dearth of gaming-specific features would look slim on a gaming console, let alone a device that\u2019s most often compared to PC. Without a frame rate counter that players can easily access, they won\u2019t know if they\u2019re getting the optimal experience from the game they\u2019re playing. Apple could have\nlooked at Nintendo\nand offered easy ways to talk to and stream game content to each other over a\nDiscord-like interface\n. You can see your friends on your contacts and chat with them over FaceTime, though Apple failed to showcase if this feature creates an on-screen window where you can watch your friends\u2019 mugs and still pay attention to what\u2019s happening on-screen.\nDespite the new overlay, this first iteration of Apple\u2019s gaming app seems mostly geared to smartphones. The Mac version may be able to incorporate games purchased outside of Apple\u2019s first-party work suite, such as Steam, though we haven\u2019t. We don\u2019t yet know if Apple will help it work with various emulator apps that were\nmade available on iPhones\nlast year, though we doubt Apple wants to step a single inch into the legal minefield of\ngame emulation\n.\nMacs are far better for gaming than they have been previously. Thanks to updates to Apple\u2019s Metal graphics API and improving graphics capabilities on the M-series chips, I\u2019m regularly surprised by performance on Mac. The most recent\nM4 MacBook Air\nwas capable of playing\nBaldur\u2019s Gate III\nand\nResident Evil 4\non medium settings with stable frame rates\u2014something that\u2019s rare to see with lightweight laptops. The\nMac mini with M4 Pro chip\nwas a surprise powerhouse that could handle some more-demanding titles. Apple has also shown Gizmodo how its\nM3 Ultra chip\non the latest\nMac Studio\ncould run the demanding\nCyberpunk 2077\non high settings with ray tracing\u2014all with a system that lacked a discrete GPU for high-end, though we have yet to try it in person.\nApple has been working behind the scenes to engender more support for its own ARM-based chips, but Windows still has it beat in terms of software support by many, many miles.

Galliker, Sergey Levine\nPaper\nUnlike chatbots or image generators, robots must operate in\nreal time\n. While a robot is \u201cthinking\u201d, the world around it\nevolves according to physical laws, so delays between inputs and outputs have a tangible impact on performance. For a\nlanguage model, the difference between fast and slow generation is a satisfied or annoyed user; for a\nvision-language-action model (VLA), it could be the difference between a robot handing you a hot coffee or spilling it in\nyour lap. While VLAs have achieved\npromising results\nin open-world\ngeneralization, they can be slow to run. Like their cousins in language and vision, these models have billions of\nparameters and require heavy-duty GPUs. On edge devices like mobile robots, that adds even more latency for network\ncommunication between a centralized inference server and the robot\n1\n.\nTo build a\nreal-time system\nwith VLAs, we are going to need some form of asynchrony: that is, we must let a model think\nabout its future actions while executing a previous one.\nAction chunking\n\u2014 where a robot outputs and executes a\nsequence of multiple actions for each inference call \u2014 provides a good starting point.\nOur\nVLAs\nall use a chunk size of 50 actions, corresponding to 1 second of real time.\nHowever, chunking alone is not enough. When we switch chunks, the new actions might not \u201cagree\u201d with the old ones,\ncausing discontinuities and unsafe accelerations. Trying to naively smooth over these discontinuities is not guaranteed\nto produce valid actions, and can have disastrous consequences.\nThe aforementioned disastrous consequences. These results are obtained by\nattempting to do real-time inference with temporal ensembling to smooth over the discontinuities, a popular prior method\nintroduced in\nACT\n(Zhou et al., 2023).\nAs a result, in\n\u03c0\n0\n,\n\u03c0\n0\n-FAST, and\n\u03c0\n0.5\n, we did not use a real-time strategy\n2\n. We executed actions\nsynchronously\n,\nmeaning that we would finish executing one chunk, wait for model inference, and then begin executing the next one. This\nway, the robot started each chunk from rest, and we circumvented the issues that arise from switching chunks\nwhile in motion. However, this introduces pauses between chunks that are still harmful \u2014 these pauses aren't in\nthe training data. Not to mention: they slow things down, are ugly to look at, and discourage us from scaling up the size\nof our models.\nTo solve these problems, we developed an algorithm that we call\nreal-time chunking\n(RTC)\n. It enables real-time\nexecution without discontinuities, and it works on any diffusion- or flow-based VLA \u2014 including\n\u03c0\n0.5\n\u2014 with\nno\ntraining-time changes\n. We found that RTC significantly sped up execution time for all the tasks we tested. It was also\nvery robust to latency, even when we injected artificial delays to cause much higher latencies than normal. RTC\ncompleted dynamic and precise tasks, like striking a match or plugging in an Ethernet cable, with inference delays of\nmore than 300 milliseconds.\nThinking while moving\nAction chunk 1\nAction chunk 2\nWhen there is an inference delay, real-time execution requires careful consideration. While a new chunk is generated\n(red), the previous chunk (green) continues executing. If the new chunk is substantially different \u2014 which it often is \u2014\nswitching to the new chunk results in disaster.\nThe core challenge of real-time execution is to maintain consistency between action chunks. By the time a new chunk has\nbeen generated by the model, the previous one has already been executed partway. Without a specialized algorithm, the new\nchunk might be totally incompatible with the robot's current trajectory \u2014 the model might be reacting to new information,\nor it might just be sampling a different \u201cstrategy\u201d from its learned distribution of behaviors. Thus, we must somehow\nuse\nthe overlapping timesteps where we have access to the remaining actions of the previous chunk. A good real-time\nalgorithm should produce a new chunk that is\nconsistent\nwith these overlapping actions while still preserving the\nmodel's reactivity to new information and ability to make intelligent decisions.\nOur key insight is to pose real-time chunking as an inpainting problem. Let's say that our model takes 3 controller\ntimesteps to produce an action chunk after receiving an observation. The first 3 actions of a new chunk can't be\nexecuted, since those timesteps will have already passed by the time the new chunk is available. Thus, it makes sense to\n\u201cfreeze\u201d those actions to the values from the previous chunk that we know\nwill\nbe executed; our goal is then to fill in\nthe remainder of the new chunk, much like inpainting a section of an image that has been removed. Depending on the chunk\nsize and how often we run inference, there will be some number of actions beyond the first 3 that also overlap with the\nprevious chunk. Rather than ignoring them completely and starting fresh, it also makes sense to\npartially attend\nto\nthese middle actions \u2014 encouraging the model to keep a consistent strategy, but allowing it to make updates based on new\ninformation.\nLuckily, diffusion and flow models happen to be really good at\nimage\ninpainting\n, even without being trained for it. By\nadapting\nthese algorithms\nto our setting and adding our \u201cpartial attention\u201d idea on\ntop, we can solve the chunk consistency problem without any training-time changes. This means we can easily apply our\nmethod directly on top of models like\n\u03c0\n0\nand\n\u03c0\n0.5\n, benefiting from all the research that goes into training while\nexecuting in real time!\nPrecision and speed with high-latency models\nWe designed a set of experiments to see how real-time chunking performs compared to synchronous inference.\nRTC should be faster, of course, since it eliminates the inference pauses between chunks. However, we also hypothesized that\nRTC would help with\nprecision\n\u2014 those pauses change the dynamics of the robot in a way that is not accounted for by the\nmodel. Therefore, we tested two short, highly precise tasks (lighting a candle with a match and plugging in an Ethernet cable)\nin addition to our standard longer-horizon tasks.\nPart of the motivation for real-time chunking is to handle higher inference delays than we have right now. Whether from\nscaling up model size, running inference on the cloud, or supporting different embodiments, latencies\nwill\nget higher,\nand handling them will become increasingly critical. Therefore, we also studied how our policies performed with +100ms and +200ms\nof artificially injected latency. At +200ms, the total inference delay on a mobile manipulator is more than one-third of\na second.\nComponent\ntime (mobile)\ntime (static)\nModel\n97ms\n97ms\nNetwork\n21ms\n6.9ms\nImage resize\n11ms\n1.4ms\nOther\n9.7ms\n3.0ms\nTotal\n139ms\n108ms\nExample latency numbers for a mobile and static robot running remote inference over the network. Even with a relatively small (3B parameter) model and a wired connection, latencies of 100ms or more are quite typical. Larger models or poorer network conditions will only make things worse.\nEvaluating the \u201cspeed\u201d of a policy is not trivial. We don't want to reward failure, no matter how speedy, nor do we want\nto reward succeeding quickly but only rarely. We devised a\nthroughput\nmetric by dividing each task into substeps \u2014\ne.g., folding one item of clothing \u2014 and then defining throughput for an episode as the proportion of substeps completed\nsuccessfully divided by the duration of the episode. As shown below, synchronous inference suffers greatly from\nincreasing inference delays, whereas the performance of real-time chunking remains completely unchanged up to +200ms.\nAverage throughput (tasks/min)\nAverage throughput (tasks/min)\nInjected Delay\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n+0ms\n+100ms\n+200ms\nRTC (ours)\nSynchronous\nTE (Zhao et al.), sparse\nTE (Zhao et al.), dense\nInference delay vs. average throughput. Error bars are \u00b11 SEM, and each point is an average over 6 tasks for 10 episodes each (totaling 60 episodes). TE refers to temporal ensembling\n(Zhou et al., 2023)\n, a naive smoothing method that averages together actions from multiple chunks. TE does not work at all at +100ms or +200ms \u2014 see the videos up above.\nOf course, we expected RTC to be faster, since it eliminates the pauses between chunks. To test our hypothesis about\nprecision, we also measured policies by another metric:\ncontroller steps\n, or equivalently, elapsed time with the\ninference pauses removed. This does not affect RTC, but gives synchronous inference an apparent boost in performance. As\nshown below, the two methods measured by controller steps often reach similar final scores; however, RTC tends to make\nmore progress earlier in the episode, indicating that it makes fewer mistakes. Check out the\nfull\npaper\nfor more in-depth results!\nPerspectives and next steps\nVLAs and other robot foundation models must handle the physical world in real time. RTC provides a very simple and\neffective strategy for real-time inference with current VLAs, and a surprising amount of resilience even to high\ninference delays. There is a lot more to do here: future robot systems will need to make complex inferences at multiple\nlevels of abstraction and multiple time scales, plan out complex and quick dynamic movements, and pause to \u201cthink harder\u201d\nas needed. Getting this right will become more and more important as models increase in size, and the scale we need for\ntrue physical intelligence will likely necessitate more sophisticated mechanisms for real-time inference.\nIf you are interested in joining us to work on these and other problems to bring physical intelligence into the real\nworld,\nget in touch\n!

We don't want to be\nforever limited to the size of a model we can fit onto a mobile robot's onboard computer.\n\u21a9\nWe did actually use an early version of real-time chunking for some parts of some videos, but not for any\nquantitative results.

Universe\u2019 Will Have \u2018A Lot of CGI,\u2019 Says Chuck Lorre\nExpect some big effects on \u201c\nStuart Fails to Save the Universe\n,\u201d the latest \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d series in development at HBO Max under\nChuck Lorre\n, fellow \u201cBig Bang\u201d creator Bill Prady and screenwriter Zak Penn (\u201cThe Avengers\u201d).\nSpeaking Monday at the\nBanff World Media Festival\nin Banff, Alberta, Canada, Lorre gave a few tidbits on the show, including the fact that he, Penn and Prady have already written ten episodes. (The Warner Bros. TV project is still in development phase and has not yet been formally picked up by HBO Max \u2014 although that seems to be a very likely thing.)\nRelated Stories\n'Prison Break' Reboot Pilot Casts Ray McKinnon, Margo Martindale, Donal Logue, Lili Taylor\nDisney Closes Hulu Deal With Comcast, Paying Billions Less Than NBCU Was Seeking\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of CGI,\u201d Lorre revealed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of special technical stuff that \u2014 you know, for me in my career, a big production number was two people sitting on a couch, drinking coffee! This is different. This is trying to incorporate some of that world of science fiction/fantasy into a comedy. And I\u2019m completely out of my element, which is what I wanted. Which is what I was hoping to do, something that I had no experience with. And maybe I can learn as we go.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nWhen it was pointed out that DC is just down the block on the Warner Bros. lot, Lorre admitted that the \u201cStuart\u201d team had a bit of an uncomfortable exchange with them recently. \u201cYeah, we had an argument with them recently \u2014 they\u2019re very protective of the Green Lantern,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were making fun of the Green Lantern. Really? Even when I was 10, I knew that stunk!\u201d\n\u201cStuart Fails to Save the Universe\u201d stars Kevin Sussman reprising his role as comic book store owner Stuart Bloom on \u201c\nThe Big Bang Theory\n.\u201d Also on board are Brian Posehn, who appeared in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d in the role of Bert Kibbler, a geologist at Caltech; Lauren Lapkus, who played Denise, the assistant manager of Stuart\u2019s comic book store and Stuart\u2019s eventual love interest; and John Ross Bowi, who will reprise the role of Barry Kripke, a fellow physicist at Cal-Tech.\n\u201cI reunited with my old pal, Bill Prady, who I created \u2018The Big Bang Theory\u2019 with, and a wonderful science fiction feature writer named Zak Penn, who\u2019s written a lot of gigantic, big time Marvel kind of movies with superheroes and things,\u201d Lorre said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve written 10 episodes of this thing.\u201d\nThat\u2019s about all he would reveal about \u201cStuart,\u201d but he did talk a bit more about the staying power of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d which ran for 12 highly-rated seasons on CBS, the prequel \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d (which ended after seven seasons last year) and the spinoff of that show, \u201cGeorgie & Mandy\u2019s First Marriage,\u201d which has been renewed for a Season 2.\n\u201cThese shows that we worked so hard on for so many years that we were so determined to make meaningful and funny at that same time, they seem to be sustaining over time, which is incredibly gratifying,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even more so, I meet people all the time who enjoy \u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 and never watched \u2018The Big Bang Theory.\u2019 They didn\u2019t even know it was a prequel, which is incredibly gratifying, because, when Steven Molaro and I started doing that, the hope was that it would stand on its own. That it would not be leaning against this 12 years of this other series. And it did, it became its own series, its own ensemble. That\u2019s immensely gratifying. The idea is to make a to make a silicon chip instead of Kleenex, something that you can use it again.\u201d\nJump to Comments\nMore from Variety\nJames Earl Jones\u2019 Darth Vader Returns to \u2018Fortnite\u2019 Using AI Technology\nTom Felton to Reprise Draco Malfoy Role in \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\u2019 on Broadway\n\u2018Glengarry Glen Ross,\u2019 Starring Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr, Recoups $7.5 Million Investment on Broadway\nWill Ferrell\u2019s \u2018Eurovision\u2019 Movie Becoming Broadway Musical\nWhere to Buy Tickets For Broadway\u2019s Biggest Tony Winners: \u2018Sunset Boulevard,\u2019 \u2018Oh, Mary,\u2019 \u2018Purpose\u2019 and More\nGeorge Clooney\u2019s \u2018Good Night, and Good Luck\u2019 Recoups $9.5 Million Broadway Investment\nLoading comments...\nMore From Our Brands\nRolling Stone\nRole Model Drops Out of Several Gracie Abrams Shows to Film Netflix\u2019s \u2018Good Sex\u2019\nRobb Report\nThis $24 Million Boston Home Doubles as an Art Gallery\nSportico\nPenn State, UCLA Deny Deals With Elevate\u2019s New College Sports\u00a0Fund\nTVLine\nSave the Dates: Love Island Spinoff, Magic City Docuseries and More\nad", "ped_digest": "P:CGI-heavy spinoff of \"The Big Bang Theory\"|Stuart Bloom reprising role|Science fiction/fantasy elements in comedy|Green Lantern jokes caused disagreement with DC|Show written by Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady, and Zak Penn|Renewed Season 2 for \"Georgie & Mandy\u2019s First Marriage\"|\"The Big Bang Theory\" sustaining over time|Hope for \"Young Sheldon\" to stand on its own|Silicon chip analogy for lasting impactE:Chuck Lorre discusses \"Stuart Fails to Save the Universe\" at Banff World Media Festival|Lorre reveals ten episodes written|Argument with DC over Green Lantern jokes|Kevin Sussman, Brian Posehn, Lauren Lapkus, and John Ross Bowi cast|\u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d and \u201cGeorgie & Mandy\u2019s First Marriage\u201d renewedD:Ten episodes written|12 seasons of \"The Big Bang Theory\"|Seven seasons of \"Young Sheldon\"|Season 2 renewal for \"Georgie & Mandy\u2019s First Marriage\"|Warner Bros.

It excludes licensing revenue from\nMicrosoft\nand large one-time deals, according to an OpenAI spokesperson.\nFor all of last year, OpenAI had around $5.5 billion in ARR. Reaching its meteoric growth rates requires a substantial amount of cash. The San Francisco-based startup lost about $5 billion last year.\nOpenAI is also targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.\nThe Information\nfirst reported on OpenAI's revenue ambitions.\nThe new revenue metrics give some context to OpenAI's monster valuation. OpenAI closed a $40 billion funding round in March, marking the largest private tech deal on record. At today's metrics, OpenAI is valued at about 30 times revenue, which highlights the hyper growth expectations by some of its largest investors. OpenAI is backed by Japan's\nSoftBank\n,\nMicrosoft\n, Coatue, Altimeter, Thrive and others.\nOpenAI burst onto the scene with the release of the consumer version of ChatGPT in late 2022, and began launching business products the following year.\nAs of late March, OpenAI said it supports\n500 million\nweekly active users. The company announced earlier this month that it has\nthree million\npaying business users, up from the two million it reported in February.\nWATCH:\nOpenAI paying business users of ChatGPT hits 3 million, up from 2 million in February\nwatch now\nVIDEO\n1:59\n01:59\nOpenAI paying business users of ChatGPT hits 3 million, up from 2 million in February\nThe Exchange\nMore In AI Effect\nFBI says Palm Springs bombing suspects used AI chat program to help plan attack\nAnnie Palmer\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang hammers chip controls that 'effectively closed' China market\nKif Leswing\nTelegram CEO announces $300 million partnership with Elon Musk's xAI and Grok\nAshley Capoot\nRead More", "ped_digest": "P:OpenAI hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue|Milestone achieved roughly 2.5 years after ChatGPT launch|Revenue includes consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and API|Targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029;E:OpenAI launched ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022|Began launching business products the following year|OpenAI supports 500 million weekly active users|Three million paying business users as of late March|Microsoft Build 2025 conference;D:$10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR)|$5.5 billion ARR last year|$5 billion loss last year|$125 billion revenue target by 2029|40 billion funding round in March|500 million weekly active users|3 million paying business users|United States|Japan|Seattle;", "er_digest": "N:SoftBank|Sam Altman|OpenAI|Microsoft|Satya Nadella|Elon Musk|Jensen Huang;R:San Francisco|Palm Springs|United States|Japan|Seattle;", "gist": "P:OpenAI hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue|Milestone achieved roughly 2.5 years after ChatGPT launch|Revenue includes consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and API|Targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029;E:OpenAI launched ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022|Began launching business products the following year|OpenAI supports 500 million weekly active users|Three million paying business users as of late March|Microsoft Build 2025 conference;D:$10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR)|$5.5 billion ARR last year|$5 billion loss last year|$125 billion revenue target by 2029|40 billion funding round in March|500 million weekly active users|3 million paying business users|United States|Japan|Seattle;N:SoftBank|Sam Altman|OpenAI|Microsoft|Satya Nadella|Elon Musk|Jensen Huang;R:San Francisco|Palm Springs|United States|Japan|Seattle;", "entities": ["SoftBank", "Sam Altman", "OpenAI", "Microsoft", "Satya Nadella", "Elon Musk", "Jensen Huang"], "regions": ["San Francisco", "Palm Springs", "United States", "Japan", "Seattle"]}, {"_id": "https://www.alphanome.ai/post/emergent-models-in-machine-learning-a-cellular-automata-and-the-quest-for-emergent-intelligence", "content": "top of page\nAlphanome.AI\nEmergent Models in Machine Learning: A Cellular Automata and the Quest for Emergent Intelligence\nAki Kakko\nApr 20\n34 min read\nThe field of Machine Learning (ML) has witnessed remarkable progress over the past decades, largely propelled by the success of deep neural networks (DNNs). These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide spectrum of tasks, from image recognition and natural language processing to complex game playing and beyond. However, despite their triumphs, DNNs exhibit certain limitations that motivate the exploration of alternative computational paradigms. Concerns persist regarding their ability to achieve true, robust\ngeneralization\nbeyond the training distribution, their often opaque decision-making processes hindering\ninterpretability\n, and the substantial computational resources and vast parameter spaces required for training and deployment.\u00a0Some analyses suggest that current ML techniques might be adept at\nsampling\nand interpolating within the complex patterns present in data, rather than constructing structured, adaptable mechanisms akin to\nbiological intelligence\n.\u00a0This realization fuels the search for fundamentally different approaches to learning and computation.\nCellular Automata (CA) represent one such distinct paradigm. Originating in the mid-20th century through the work of pioneers like John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, and later popularized by John Conway's Game of Life and Stephen Wolfram's systematic studies, CA are discrete dynamical systems characterized by grids of simple computational units (\"cells\") that evolve based on local interaction rules.\u00a0Despite the simplicity of their components and rules, CA are capable of generating extraordinarily complex and often unpredictable global behavior \u2013 a phenomenon known as\nemergence\n.\u00a0Furthermore, certain CA possess profound computational capabilities, proven to be equivalent in power to Universal Turing Machines, demonstrating that\ncomplex computation does not necessitate complex components\n. The concept of emergence is central to the appeal of CA. It describes how macroscopic properties and behaviors arise from the\ncollective interactions\nof microscopic components in ways that are not easily reducible to the properties of the individual parts.\u00a0This resonates deeply with the goals of Artificial Intelligence, where the aim is often to achieve complex, intelligent behavior from underlying computational processes. The ability of CA to exhibit rich emergent dynamics from simple, local rules suggests a potential pathway towards building artificial systems that self-organize and develop complex capabilities organically.\nThis article looks into the burgeoning intersection of Cellular Automata and Machine Learning, investigating how the principles of CA and emergence are being harnessed to inspire and develop novel ML models. A central focus is the concept of \"Emergent Models\" (EMs), a theoretical framework proposed as a direct alternative to neural networks, drawing inspiration from CA and Turing machines.\u00a0Additionally, the article examines the broader and more established family of Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs), which explicitly integrate deep learning techniques within a CA-like structure. The objective of this analysis is to provide an assessment of CA-based emergent models within the context of machine learning. This involves exploring their theoretical underpinnings, surveying the current state of research and development, evaluating their potential advantages (such as parallelism, robustness, and novel capabilities) and inherent disadvantages (like controllability and training challenges) compared to traditional ML methods, and discussing their potential future implications. By synthesizing information from foundational work on CA and emergence with recent research on EMs and NCAs, this article aims to offer a nuanced perspective on whether these approaches represent a viable alternative or a complementary direction to mainstream deep learning in the ongoing quest for artificial intelligence. The subsequent sections will systematically define CA and\nemergence\n, analyze the EM and NCA frameworks, survey applications, evaluate the paradigm, discuss the research landscape, and finally, consider future prospects.\nII. Fundamentals of Cellular Automata and Emergence\nA thorough understanding of Cellular Automata (CA) and the concept of emergence is prerequisite to appreciating their potential role in machine learning. This section defines the core properties of CA, explores their computational power, and elucidates the phenomenon of emergence, particularly within the context of CA.\nDefining Cellular Automata (CA)\nCellular automata are abstract computational systems defined by a set of fundamental properties that distinguish them from other models like Turing machines or standard neural networks.\u00a0Based on foundational definitions and common usage, the core components are:\nDiscrete Lattice:\nA CA consists of a regular grid of cells\n, typically arranged in one, two, or more dimensions (n-dimensional lattice). While various cell shapes (e.g., squares, hexagons) are possible, homogeneity is usually assumed, meaning all cells are identical in their basic properties.\nDiscrete States:\nEach cell in the lattice can exist in one state from a finite set \u03a3, where the number of possible states \u2223\u03a3\u2223=k\u00a0is finite. Often, states are binary (k=2, e.g., 0/1, black/white, dead/alive), but multi-state CAs are also common.\nDiscrete Time:\nThe system evolves in discrete time steps (t,t+1,t+2,...).\nLocal Interaction Rule:\nThe state of a cell at the next time step (t+1) is determined by a transition function or rule, denoted as \u03d5. This rule takes as input the states of the cells within a defined\nlocal neighborhood\nat the current time step (t).\u00a0The neighborhood typically includes the cell itself and its immediate neighbors (e.g., von Neumann neighborhood - orthogonal neighbors, or Moore neighborhood - orthogonal and diagonal neighbors in 2D). Crucially, interactions are strictly local; there is no \"action at a distance\".\nUniformity and Synchronicity:\nTypically, the same transition rule \u03d5\u00a0is applied identically to every cell in the grid (uniformity).\u00a0Furthermore, all cells update their states simultaneously based on the neighborhood states at time t\u00a0(synchronicity).\nWhile asynchronous CA variations exist\n, where cells update independently or based on different clocks, the synchronous model is the most common starting point.\nThe behavior of a CA on a finite grid is also influenced by\nBoundary Conditions\n, which specify how cells at the edges interact.\nCommon choices include\n:\nPeriodic (or Toroidal) Boundaries:\nCells at one edge are considered neighbors of cells at the opposite edge, effectively wrapping the grid into a torus. This minimizes edge effects and simulates an infinite space.\nFixed (or Absorbing) Boundaries:\nEdge cells maintain a constant state (e.g., always '0') or act as sinks, not influencing their neighbors.\nNull Boundaries:\nBoundary cells are assumed to have neighbors with a fixed 'null' state (often 0).\nThe choice of boundary condition can significantly impact the global dynamics of the system. To categorize the diverse behaviors exhibited by CA, Stephen Wolfram proposed a heuristic classification scheme, particularly for one-dimensional elementary CA (ECA - binary states, nearest-neighbor interactions):\nClass 1:\nEvolution leads rapidly to a stable, homogeneous state (e.g., all cells '0' or all '1'). Randomness disappears.\nClass 2:\nEvolution leads quickly to simple stable or oscillating structures (periodic patterns). Local changes tend to remain local.\nClass 3:\nEvolution appears chaotic or pseudo-random. Stable structures are typically destroyed, and local changes tend to spread indefinitely.\nClass 4:\nEvolution leads to complex, interacting structures with long transients. These rules often exhibit localized structures (\"gliders\") that move and interact in complex ways. Class 4 is often associated with the potential for universal computation and is sometimes described as operating at the \"edge of chaos,\" a regime between order (Class 2) and chaos (Class 3).\nThis classification, while heuristic, provides a useful framework for understanding the relationship between simple local rules and the complexity of the resulting global behavior. The fundamental computational paradigm defined by these properties\u2014locality, parallelism, discrete states and time, and uniform rules\u2014contrasts sharply with both the sequential, single-point processing of Turing machines\u00a0and the often global, weighted-sum computations found in fully connected layers of artificial neural networks.\u00a0This distinct structure, particularly its inherent parallelism, suggests potential advantages for specific computational tasks and hardware implementations, forming a primary motivation for exploring CA in the context of machine learning.\nComputational Power of CA\nDespite their apparent simplicity, CA possess significant computational capabilities:\nTuring Completeness:\nA key finding in CA research is that some simple CA rules are capable of\nuniversal computation\n. This means they can simulate a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) and, by the Church-Turing thesis, compute any function that is\ntheoretically computable\n.\u00a0Famous examples include John Conway's two-dimensional\nGame of Life\nand the one-dimensional elementary\nRule 110\n.\u00a0The proof typically involves demonstrating how basic computational elements (like logic gates, data storage, signal transmission) can be constructed and interact within the CA's evolution.\u00a0This theoretical equivalence to Turing machines establishes that CA are not computationally limited by their simple structure. The demonstration that maximal computational power can arise from simple, local interactions without complex components or global communication provides a compelling theoretical foundation for the idea that\ncomplex intelligent behavior\n, a goal of AI, might similarly\nemerge from systems\ncomposed of simple, locally interacting learning units. This lends theoretical support to proposals like Emergent Models, which\nhypothesize\nthat shifting complexity from intricate transition functions (like deep NNs) to the iterative application of simple rules over a large state space is a viable path for ML.\nParallelism:\nUnlike the inherently sequential operation of a Turing machine's read/write head, CA operate in a massively parallel fashion, with all cells updating simultaneously based on their local neighborhoods.\u00a0This parallelism is a defining characteristic and allows complex patterns and computations to emerge relatively quickly across the entire grid.\u00a0This inherent parallelism makes CA naturally suited for implementation on parallel hardware like GPUs or potentially specialized\narchitectures\n.\nComputational Irreducibility:\nFor CA capable of complex behavior (especially Class 4 and universal CA), Wolfram introduced the concept of\ncomputational irreducibility\n. This principle suggests that there is often no computational shortcut to determine the outcome of the CA's evolution from a given initial state other than by explicitly simulating each step of the process. The simulation itself is the most efficient way to predict its own future state.\u00a0This implies intrinsic limits on the predictability of complex systems and highlights the idea that the process of computation itself can be fundamental.\nThe Phenomenon of\nEmergence\nEmergence is a concept central to\ncomplex systems science\nand intrinsically linked to the behavior of Cellular Automata.\nDefinition:\nEmergence occurs when a system composed of many interacting components exhibits properties or behaviors at a macroscopic level that are not present in, or trivially predictable from, the properties of the individual components in isolation.\u00a0These emergent phenomena are features of the system\nas a whole\n, arising from the organization and interactions between the parts.\u00a0Common phrases used to capture this idea include\n\"the whole is more than the sum of its parts\"\nor that emergent properties are \"meaningful only when attributed to the whole, not to its parts\".\u00a0Examples range from the formation of snowflakes and\nflocking patterns in birds\nto\nconsciousness\narising from neurons\u00a0and market trends from individual economic decisions.\nEmergence in CA:\nCA provide quintessential examples of emergence. Simple,\ndeterministic\n, and strictly local rules, when applied iteratively across a grid of cells, can lead to the spontaneous formation of complex, large-scale patterns and dynamic structures (like the \"gliders\" and \"spaceships\" in Conway's Game of Life) that are entirely unexpected from the rules themselves.\u00a0This demonstrates how global order and complexity can arise purely from local interactions without any central control or blueprint. It is crucial to recognize that emergence in CA, while often surprising, is not mystical; it is a deterministic consequence of the\niterative application of the local rules over time\n.\u00a0Understanding this causal link is vital for harnessing emergence in ML: the goal becomes designing\nlearnable\nlocal rules such that desired\nglobal\noutcomes (e.g., classification, pattern generation, robust behavior) arise through the process of interaction and\nself-organization\nover multiple iterations.\u00a0This reframes the ML task from finding a direct input-output map to discovering generative local dynamics.\nWeak vs. Strong Emergence:\nPhilosophers distinguish between\nweak emergence\nand\nstrong emergence\n.\u00a0Weakly emergent properties are novel features arising from component interactions. While they might not be predictable through simple reductionist analysis of the parts, they are often considered understandable or simulatable\nin principle\ngiven full knowledge of the components and interactions.\u00a0The emergent patterns in CA typically fall under this category. Strongly emergent properties, in contrast, are hypothesized to possess irreducible causal powers that act \"downward\" on the lower-level components, meaning the whole genuinely influences the parts in a way not fully determined by the parts themselves.\u00a0Strong emergence is more metaphysically contentious and less commonly invoked in\nscientific explanations\n.\nEmergence, Causality, and ML:\nEmergence is tightly linked to\ncausality\nin complex systems. The emergent macroscopic behavior can be seen as the causal effect of the underlying microscopic interactions.\u00a0Furthermore, new causal relationships or laws might themselves emerge at higher levels of abstraction.\u00a0From an ML perspective, emergence is potentially highly desirable. It represents the possibility for a system to develop complex, adaptive, robust, and perhaps even unforeseen capabilities that go beyond its explicitly programmed rules, driven instead by the dynamics of interaction and learning.\u00a0Harnessing this potential is a key motivation behind exploring CA-inspired ML models.\nIII. Emergent Models (EMs): A Cellular Automata-Inspired ML Paradigm\nBuilding upon the foundations of Cellular Automata and the concept of emergence, a novel class of machine learning models, termed\nEmergent Models (EMs)\n, has been proposed as a fundamental alternative to the dominant neural network paradigm.\u00a0This section details the conceptual framework, core arguments, hypothesized capabilities, and proposed training methodologies for EMs, based primarily on the originating proposal.\nConceptual Framework\nThe proposal for\nEmergent Models\nstems from a critique of perceived limitations in contemporary ML models, particularly deep neural networks.\u00a0The argument posits that NNs often excel at capturing surface-level statistical patterns within training data but may struggle to achieve true,\nrobust generalization to novel situations\n. This perceived shortcoming is attributed, in part, to the reliance of NNs on computing a complex, highly parameterized function in a single forward pass (a \"one-shot\" transition) to map inputs to outputs.\nIn contrast, EMs draw inspiration from computational processes observed in\nbiological systems\nand physics, as well as the theoretical underpinnings of Turing machines and Cellular Automata.\u00a0These systems often evolve through the\niterative\napplication of relatively\nsimple\nrules or transition functions acting upon a\nlarge state space\n.\u00a0EMs aim to emulate this dynamic, iterative computational style.\nThe core idea is to shift the locus of complexity. Instead of encoding complexity primarily within the parameters of an intricate, single-step transition function (as in NNs), EMs propose to encode complexity within a large, evolving state space, governed by the repeated application of a fixed, simpler update rule.\u00a0Computation in an EM proceeds recursively until a specific halting condition is met. This iterative nature allows for variable computation time, potentially adapting the computational effort based on the complexity of the input.\nA key theoretical distinction lies in the foundation of their expressive power. While NNs rely on the\nUniversal Approximation Theorem\n(which states that a sufficiently large NN can approximate any continuous function), EMs leverage the principle of\nTuring Completeness\n.\u00a0By basing the model on underlying dynamics that can be Turing-complete (like certain CA rules), EMs theoretically gain the capacity to model\nany possible algorithm\nor computable function, not just continuous mappings.\u00a0This positions EMs not merely as function approximators, but as potential general-purpose algorithmic modeling systems. The EM framework thus represents a more fundamental departure from standard deep learning compared to models like Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). While NCAs integrate neural network components (as learnable rules) into a CA-like structure, EMs propose replacing the NN paradigm altogether with iterative dynamics inspired directly by the computational processes of CA and Turing machines.\nCore Arguments and Hypotheses\nBased on this conceptual framework, several core arguments and hypotheses are put forward regarding the potential advantages of EMs:\nAlternative Modeling Approach:\nEMs are presented as a fundamentally different way to approach modeling and learning compared to NNs and other traditional ML techniques.\nEnhanced Generalization and Reduced Overfitting:\nA central hypothesis is that the iterative application of simple, local rules over a large state space acts as a form of inherent regularization. This process is conjectured to reduce the tendency to overfit the training data and lead to improved generalization performance compared to NNs that learn complex mappings directly.\u00a0This links the model's generalization ability directly to its\ncomputational process\n(iterative refinement based on simple rules) rather than solely to the static architecture of a function approximator. It suggests that mimicking the dynamic evolution seen in physical systems or Turing machines might be a more effective path to generalization than single-pass function approximation.\nExpressivity and Efficiency:\nEMs are argued to offer high expressivity,\ngrounded\nin their potential Turing Completeness, allowing them to model any algorithm.\u00a0Simultaneously, the use of simple update rules could potentially lead to computational efficiency, although the overall efficiency depends on the number of iterations required to reach a solution.\nBiological Plausibility:\nThe iterative, state-based computation of EMs, driven by repeated application of simple rules, is suggested to be potentially\nmore analogous to biological processes\n(like development or neural dynamics) than the layered, feedforward structure of many NNs.\nHypothesized Capabilities\nBeyond the core arguments, EMs are hypothesized to possess unique capabilities stemming from their architecture:\nUniversal\nMeta-Learning\n:\nPerhaps the most striking claim is that EMs possess \"Universal Meta-Learning capabilities\".\u00a0This arises from their proposed ability to self-modify their internal state in such a way that the state itself comes to encode the algorithm being modeled.\u00a0This is contrasted with NNs, where\nweights\nare modified by an\nexternal\noptimization algorithm (like\ngradient descent\n) based on a loss signal. The EM, in theory, could learn to adapt its own computational process internally, without explicit external guidance for\nhow\nto modify its \"program\".\u00a0If realizable, this capability would represent a significant step towards models that can autonomously adapt their learning strategies or internal algorithms, a characteristic often associated with biological adaptation and\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI)\n.\nDevelopment of Inductive Biases:\nAs a consequence of self-modification, EMs are hypothesized to be able to develop and encode\ninductive\nbiases\nwithin their state.\u00a0Inductive biases are assumptions or preferences that guide learning and generalization. The ability to learn these biases dynamically could allow EMs to adapt more effectively to different tasks or data distributions.\nPathway to AGI:\nBased on their potential for universal computation, enhanced generalization, and meta-learning capabilities, EMs are proposed as a \"possible road to AGI\".\nTo empirically investigate these claims, the proposal outlines a plan to implement EMs and evaluate their performance on a toy\nreinforcement learning\ntask \u2013 specifically, controlling a simulated car in a 2D environment. This evaluation aims to assess the expressivity, stability, and learning speed of EMs, and critically, to observe whether meta-learning abilities emerge spontaneously during training.\nTraining EMs\nGiven the potentially complex, iterative, and possibly non-differentiable nature of the dynamics within an EM, traditional gradient-based optimization methods used for NNs may not be suitable or optimal. The proposal explicitly suggests training EMs using\nblack-box\noptimization algorithms\n.\u00a0Examples mentioned include genetic algorithms and\nBayesian\noptimization. These methods do not require gradient information and can optimize systems based purely on evaluating their performance on a given task, making them well-suited for exploring the behavior of complex dynamical systems like EMs.\nThe Emergent Model proposal\noutlines a novel ML paradigm inspired by the computational principles of Cellular Automata and Turing machines. It hypothesizes that by shifting complexity to iterative dynamics over a large state space, EMs could offer advantages in generalization, expressivity, and meta-learning, potentially providing a new direction towards more capable and adaptable\nAI systems\n. However, these remain largely theoretical claims pending empirical validation through the proposed experimental work.\nIV. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA): Bridging CA and Deep Learning\nWhile Emergent Models propose a radical departure from neural networks, a more established and actively researched area involves directly merging the principles of Cellular Automata with the machinery of deep learning. This hybrid approach is known as\nNeural Cellular Automata (NCA)\n. NCAs retain the core CA structure of a grid of locally interacting cells evolving over time but replace the traditionally fixed, hand-crafted update rules with learnable functions parameterized by neural networks.\nDefinition and Architecture\nCore Concept:\nNCAs are dynamical systems defined on a grid, where each cell's state evolves based on local interactions, similar to classical CA. The defining feature is that the\nlocal update rule is implemented by a neural network\n(typically a small convolutional neural network (CNN) or multi-layer perceptron (MLP)), whose parameters are learned through optimization, usually gradient descent.\u00a0This integration allows the powerful function approximation capabilities and optimization techniques of deep learning to be applied to discover CA rules that generate desired complex behaviors.\u00a0This approach effectively makes the challenging \"rule discovery\" problem, which hindered the application of classical CA to complex tasks, tractable through learning.\nContinuous States:\nUnlike the discrete states (e.g., 0 or 1) typical of classical CA, cells in NCAs usually possess\ncontinuous state vectors\n.\u00a0These vectors consist of multiple channels, which can represent various types of information:\nVisible properties (e.g., RGB color values).\nA \"vitality\" or \"alpha\" channel, often indicating whether a cell is considered \"alive\" or part of the pattern.\nHidden state channels, used for internal computation and communication between cells, allowing for more complex information exchange than simple state sharing.\nUpdate Process\n:\nThe evolution of an NCA typically involves iterative application of a two-stage update process for each cell:\nPerception:\nEach cell gathers information about its state and the states of its neighbors within a defined local neighborhood (e.g., a 3x3 grid). This perception can be achieved using fixed filters (like Sobel filters to detect gradients) or learnable convolutional filters. The result is a \"perception vector\" summarizing the local environment.\nUpdate:\nThe perception vector is fed into the learned neural network (the update rule). The network outputs an update value (often a state\ndelta\nor increment, inspired by residual networks). This update is then applied to the cell's current state to determine its state at the next time step.\nStability Mechanisms:\nTo promote stable learning and robust behavior, techniques like\nstochastic updates\n(randomly updating only a fraction of cells at each step, acting as regularization) and careful initialization (e.g., initializing the final layer weights to zero for \"do-nothing\" initial behavior) are often employed.\nRelationship to RNNs/CNNs:\nNCAs share characteristics with both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They can be viewed as a specific type of RNN where the recurrence occurs over time steps, and the update function (the NN) has weights shared across all spatial locations, similar to a convolutional layer.\u00a0However, a key distinction is\nhow\nthe NN/convolution is used. In standard CNNs, convolutions are typically used in a feedforward manner for hierarchical feature extraction.\u00a0In NCAs, the NN\ndefines the dynamical update rule itself\n, which is applied iteratively to evolve the system's state over time.\u00a0This iterative application on a stateful grid gives NCAs characteristics of systems with potentially infinite impulse responses, unlike feedforward networks.\nKey Variants and Enhancements\nThe basic NCA framework has proven flexible, leading to the development of numerous variants tailored for specific tasks or properties. This diversity indicates an active field exploring different design trade-offs within the NCA paradigm, mirroring the architectural evolution seen in mainstream deep learning. Notable examples include:\nGrowing NCAs:\nA prominent line of research focuses on\nmorphogenesis\n\u2013 training NCAs to grow a specific target pattern (often a 2D image) from a minimal initial state (e.g., a single \"seed\" cell) and subsequently maintain or regenerate that pattern against perturbations.\u00a0Training often involves techniques like maintaining a \"sample pool\" of diverse states and applying damage during training to explicitly encourage robustness and regeneration.\u00a0The recurring theme of regeneration in these studies suggests an intrinsic property derived from the distributed, local, and iterative computation, offering a contrast to the potential fragility of some large, monolithic feedforward models.\nAttention-based NCAs (ViTCA):\nInspired by the success of Transformers,\nVision Transformer Cellular Automata (ViTCA)\nincorporate spatially localized self-attention mechanisms into the NCA update rule.\u00a0This allows cells to weigh the importance of information from different parts of their neighborhood (and implicitly, over iterations, from further away) more dynamically than fixed convolutions might allow. ViTCA has shown strong performance in tasks like denoising autoencoding, outperforming standard U-Nets and ViTs of comparable parameter complexity.\nLatent NCAs (LNCA):\nTo address the computational cost of running NCAs on high-resolution inputs, LNCA performs the iterative updates within a compressed\nlatent space\n, learned by a pre-trained autoencoder.\u00a0This significantly reduces memory usage and latency, enabling the processing of much larger inputs with the same resources, although it comes with a trade-off in terms of task performance (e.g., image restoration quality).\nDifferentiable Logic CA (DiffLogic CA)\n:\nThis variant replaces the standard neural network update rule with circuits composed of\ndifferentiable logic gates\n(continuous relaxations of Boolean operations like AND, OR, XOR).\u00a0It operates on discrete (binary) cell states. This approach aims for enhanced\ninterpretability\n(as the learned rules are logic circuits) and computational efficiency (binary operations are cheaper than matrix multiplications), and has been demonstrated to learn the rules of Conway's Game of Life and generate other patterns. It is also linked to the\nconcept of programmable matter\n.\nAdaptor NCAs (AdaNCA)\n:\nInstead of being standalone models, AdaNCAs are designed as small, plug-and-play NCA modules inserted between the layers of existing Vision Transformers (ViTs). Their purpose is to leverage the known robustness properties of NCAs to enhance the resilience of ViTs against adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution inputs in image classification tasks, demonstrating a practical application of NCAs in improving existing deep learning architectures.\nOther Specialized Variants:\nResearch continues to explore further specializations, including:\nIsotropic NCAs\n:\nDesigned to be invariant to rotation by modifying the perception mechanism or allowing cells to control their own orientation.\nActive NCAs\n:\nAllow the NCA kernels (or their receptive fields) to move within the input space, enabling active sensing behaviors.\nGene-Regulated NCAs (ENIGMA)\n:\nIncorporate simulated gene regulatory networks and cell-cell signaling into the update rule for more biologically faithful modeling of development.\nNCA for Spatio-Temporal Patterns\n:\nExplicitly designed to learn dynamic,\ntime-varying patterns\n, not just static endpoints.\nNCA with Diffusion Models\n:\nCombining NCA principles with denoising diffusion models for generative tasks.\nTraining Methodologies\nThe ability to train NCAs effectively is crucial to their utility. Several approaches are employed:\nGradient Descent\n:\nThe most common method relies on the differentiability of the neural network update rule. By defining a loss function that measures the difference between the NCA's state after a certain number of steps and a target state (or measures performance on a task), gradients can be computed through the iterative update process (often using\nbackpropagation\nthrough time, BPTT) and used to optimize the network parameters.\u00a0This end-to-end differentiability is the key innovation that connects NCAs to modern deep learning.\nEvolutionary Algorithms\n:\nFor scenarios where gradient-based optimization is\ndifficult or impossible\n(e.g., non-differentiable components like the actions in Active NCA, or exploring highly complex or discrete rule spaces), evolutionary strategies (ES) like CMA-ES or genetic algorithms (GAs) are used.\u00a0This approach connects back to early work on evolving rules for classical CA.\nDifferentiable CA:\nResearch also explores making traditionally discrete CA systems amenable to gradient-based optimization. This can involve using continuous relaxations of discrete rules (as in DiffLogic CA) or defining rules that operate on\nprobability distributions\nover states rather than deterministic states.\nIn essence, Neural Cellular Automata represent a powerful and flexible framework that leverages deep learning to unlock the potential of Cellular Automata principles for complex tasks. By learning local rules that give rise to desired global emergent behaviors, NCAs offer a unique approach to modeling dynamic, self-organizing systems, with active research exploring\ndiverse architectures\n, training methods, and applications.\nV. Applications and Examples of CA-Based Machine Learning\nThe theoretical potential of Cellular Automata and the practical advancements in Neural Cellular Automata have spurred applications across a growing range of domains. These applications often leverage the unique characteristics of CA-based models, such as their capacity for emergence, self-organization, robustness, and distributed computation.\nMorphogenesis, Regeneration, and Pattern Formation\nPerhaps the most iconic application area for NCAs is modeling\nmorphogenesis\n\u2013 the biological process of development and pattern formation.\nGrowing and Maintaining Patterns:\nThe canonical task involves training an NCA to grow a specific 2D target image (e.g., a lizard, emoji, or abstract pattern) starting from a single \"seed\" cell.\u00a0The NCA learns local rules that coordinate cell states (often representing color and vitality) to collectively form the target shape.\nRegeneration and Robustness:\nA key success in this area is the demonstration of\nregenerative\ncapabilities. NCAs trained for morphogenesis often exhibit remarkable robustness, able to repair damage (e.g., if parts of the grown pattern are erased or cut out) and regrow the correct structure through continued application of the learned local rules.\u00a0This emergent\nself-healing\nproperty is a major differentiator from many traditional generative models.\n3D Morphogenesis:\nThe concept has been extended to three dimensions, for example, training NCAs to grow complex 3D structures within the voxel-based environment of Minecraft, including castles and even simple functional machines.\nSimulated soft robots\nhave also been evolved and regenerated using NCA principles.\nDynamic Patterns:\nResearch is moving beyond static targets to learn rules that govern\ndynamic\nspatio-temporal patterns.\u00a0This includes learning the dynamics of reaction-diffusion systems described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), such as those generating Turing patterns (spots and stripes), demonstrating the potential of NCAs as data-driven simulators of complex physical or biological processes.\nArtificial Life (ALife):\nThese morphogenesis and pattern formation capabilities connect directly to the field of Artificial Life, which studies life-like behaviors in artificial systems.\u00a0NCAs serve as computational substrates for exploring emergence, self-organization, adaptation, and evolution. Techniques like\nAutomated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL)\nuse foundation models to guide the search for novel and interesting behaviors in ALife systems, including NCAs, discovering previously unseen Lenia lifeforms and complex CA rules.\nImage Processing, Restoration, and Classification\nNCAs are increasingly being applied to various computer vision tasks, often positioned as alternatives or complements to standard CNNs.\nImage Restoration:\nLatent NCAs (LNCAs)\nhave been proposed for resource-efficient image restoration tasks like denoising and deblurring, operating in a compressed latent space to reduce computational load.\nAttention-based NCAs (ViTCA)\nhave also been applied successfully to denoising autoencoding.\nImage Classification:\nNCAs have been developed for image classification, for instance, classifying MNIST digits\u00a0or, more notably, classifying white blood cell images for\ndiagnosing hematological disorders\n.\u00a0These studies often emphasize the potential for NCAs to achieve competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and exhibit greater robustness to domain shifts compared to conventional CNN-based methods.\u00a0Furthermore, Adaptor NCAs (AdaNCA) demonstrate that integrating\nNCA modules into Vision Transformers\ncan enhance their robustness for image classification on challenging benchmarks like ImageNet.\nClassical CA have also been used to generate controlled image datasets\nto probe the limitations and failure modes (e.g., shortcut learning) of standard CNNs.\nImage Segmentation:\nNCAs are finding applications in\nmedical image segmentation\n, tasked with identifying specific structures (e.g., hippocampus, prostate tumors) in medical scans.\u00a0Models like\nMed-NCA\nand\nNCA-Morph\n(for image registration, closely related to segmentation)\u00a0have shown promising results, again often highlighting advantages in model size (e.g., Med-NCA being 500 times smaller than a U-Net) and generalization capabilities across different datasets or imaging modalities.\u00a0Classical CA techniques have also been explored for segmentation historically.\nTexture Synthesis and Generation:\nThe ability of NCAs to generate complex patterns makes them suitable for\ntexture synthesis\n. Research explores generating dynamic textures\u00a0and training single NCAs capable of generating multiple different textures based on\ninternal \"genomic\" signals\n.\nDifferentiable Logic CAs have also been used for pattern generation.\u00a0Variational NCAs (VNCAs) represent an effort to build\nprobabilistic generative models\nusing the NCA framework.\u00a0NCA-based diffusion models like\nDiff-NCA and FourierDiff-NCA\nfurther explore this generative potential.\nSalient Object Detection (SOD):\nOne approach combines\nFeature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) encoders with CA methods for salient object detection\n, particularly aiming for efficiency in data-scarce or resource-constrained scenarios like medical applications.\nReinforcement Learning\nand Control Tasks\nThe dynamic and stateful nature of CA-based models lends itself to sequential decision-making problems.\nEMs in RL:\nThe initial proposal for Emergent Models includes evaluating them on a reinforcement learning task (simulated driving) to test their expressivity and potential for emergent meta-learning.\nNCAs in RL\n:\nNCAs have been applied to standard RL benchmarks like cart-pole balancing, 3D locomotion control, and playing Atari games, demonstrating their capability in learning control policies.\nDistributed Control:\nNCAs are being explored for\ncontrolling distributed manipulator systems\n(arrays of actuators). Their decentralized nature, where control emerges from local interactions, promotes scalability and\nfault tolerance\n, allowing the system to estimate global properties (like object center) from local sensing.\nAbstract Reasoning:\nTransformers have been used to train NCAs\nto learn and generalize the rules of Elementary Cellular Automata, showing potential for learning abstract reasoning and planning capabilities within the CA framework.\nOther Potential Areas\nThe flexibility of CA and NCA principles suggests applicability in other diverse areas:\nComplex System\nModeling:\nCA remain a powerful tool for simulating and understanding complex systems across various fields, including physics, biology, and social sciences, due to their ability to capture emergent phenomena arising from local interactions.\nLearning and Memory:\nStructurally dynamic CA\n, where the connections (graph edges) can change over time, have been proposed as computational models for exploring learning and memory processes.\nCryptography:\nClassical CA have found applications in cryptography, for instance, in designing pseudorandom number generators and stream ciphers.\nParameter Identification:\nConversely,\nML techniques (like CNNs) can be used to analyze CA\ndynamics, for example, by identifying hidden parameters governing a CA's evolution from observed data.\nScientific Discovery:\nThe potential for NCAs to learn underlying dynamics from data suggests applications in scientific modeling and discovery, particularly in biology (e.g., pattern formation, gene regulation) and potentially chemistry or physics.\nProgrammable Matter:\nA long-term, ambitious vision involves using CA/NCA principles, especially variants like DiffLogic CA that operate with discrete logic, as a foundation for creating\nprogrammable matter\n\u2013 materials whose physical properties and computational behavior can be controlled through local interactions.\nThe breadth of these applications underscores the growing interest in CA-based ML. While still an emerging field compared to mainstream deep learning, the demonstrated successes, particularly in areas leveraging robustness, self-organization, and dynamic modeling, highlight its unique potential. The recurring theme across many applications is the ability of these models, especially NCAs, to offer solutions that are inherently robust, regenerative, potentially scalable, and often\nparameter-efficient\n, making them attractive for specific niches.\u00a0Furthermore, their innate capacity to model\ndynamic\nprocesses evolving over time\ndistinguishes them from static input-output mapping models and aligns them well with problems in biology, physics, and adaptive control.\nVI. Evaluation: Advantages and Disadvantages of CA-Based ML\nEvaluating any machine learning paradigm requires a balanced assessment of its strengths and weaknesses relative to established methods and application requirements. Cellular Automata-based approaches, encompassing both the theoretical\nEmergent Models (EMs)\nand the practical Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) and their variants, present a unique set of potential advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional neural networks like CNNs and Transformers.\nPotential Strengths\nParallelism:\nThe core definition of CA involves local rules applied synchronously across the entire grid. This inherent parallelism lends itself naturally to implementation on massively parallel hardware like GPUs, TPUs, or potentially specialized CA hardware, offering the potential for significant speedups in simulation and computation compared to sequential models.\u00a0Libraries like\nCAX, built on JAX\n, explicitly aim to leverage this for hardware acceleration in NCA research.\nSimplicity (of Rules):\nA fundamental principle of CA is the emergence of complex global behavior from the iterative application of simple, local rules.\u00a0While the learned rules in NCAs are neural networks, they often operate locally and can sometimes be relatively small compared to large monolithic DNNs.\u00a0The EM proposal explicitly aims for simplicity in the fixed update rule.\nRobustness and Regeneration:\nNCAs, particularly those trained for morphogenesis (Growing NCAs), have demonstrated remarkable robustness to perturbations and an ability to regenerate or self-repair damage.\u00a0This resilience arises from the distributed nature of the computation, where local rules continue to operate even if parts of the system are damaged. Techniques like stochastic updates further enhance this robustness.\u00a0Adaptor NCAs have also been shown to improve the adversarial robustness of ViTs.\u00a0This inherent robustness is often linked directly to the CA principles of local, distributed control.\nGeneralization:\nThere is evidence and strong hypotheses suggesting CA-based models may offer advantages in generalization. EMs are hypothesized to achieve better generalization through their iterative computational process.\u00a0NCAs have shown promising generalization capabilities, particularly in handling\nout-of-distribution (OOD)\ndata in medical imaging tasks.\u00a0DiffLogic CA demonstrated generalization by replicating various Game of Life patterns beyond its training examples.\nParameter Efficiency:\nNCAs can often perform complex tasks using significantly fewer parameters than their traditional deep learning counterparts. Examples include NCAs for medical image segmentation being orders of magnitude smaller than U-Nets, lightweight NCAs for classification, generative NCAs with relatively few parameters, and efficient NCA-based diffusion models\u00a0and registration models.\u00a0Latent NCAs further push resource efficiency.\u00a0This efficiency can be crucial for\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices\n.\nScalability (Potential):\nThe decentralized architecture, relying only on local interactions, suggests that CA-based models could potentially scale well to very large systems or grids.\u00a0Active NCAs can operate effectively even when smaller than the input image size, and DiffLogic CA's efficiency aids scalability.\u00a0Libraries like CAX aim to enable large-scale experiments.\u00a0However, as discussed below, practical scalability remains a challenge.\nEmergent Capabilities:\nBy their nature, CA-based models are well-suited for studying and harnessing\nemergence\n. This includes self-organization, complex pattern formation, and the potential for developing unforeseen adaptive behaviors through interaction.\u00a0The EM framework hypothesizes the emergence of advanced capabilities like meta-learning.\nDiscrete States/Interpretability (Specific Variants):\nVariants like DiffLogic CA operate on discrete states and use logic gates, potentially offering greater interpretability compared to the continuous values and complex non-linearities of standard NNs or NCAs.\nPotential Weaknesses\nControllability and Predictability:\nThe very emergence that makes CA interesting can also make them difficult to control and predict.\u00a0Designing or learning local rules that reliably produce a specific desired global behavior (the \"inverse problem\") remains a significant challenge.\u00a0The final outcome can be sensitive to initial conditions or small rule changes.\nTraining Stability and Difficulty:\nTraining NCAs, especially using gradient descent through time (BPTT), can be unstable and challenging.\u00a0Issues like vanishing or exploding gradients can arise during long\ntemporal rollouts\n.\u00a0Specialized techniques like sample pools, careful initialization, or stochastic updates are often required to achieve stable convergence.\u00a0The black-box optimization methods proposed for EMs can be sample-inefficient and computationally expensive.\u00a0These training difficulties often arise from integrating ML techniques needed to make CA learn complex tasks.\nScalability Challenges (Practical):\nWhile theoretically scalable due to local rules, practical scalability faces hurdles. The computational cost of training NCAs via BPTT can increase significantly with the number of simulation steps required.\u00a0Ensuring that learned rules generalize effectively to grid sizes much larger than those seen during training is not guaranteed and remains an active research question.\u00a0Some applications have encountered bottlenecks, e.g., in\nauxiliary optimization steps\n.\u00a0LNCA improves computational scalability but at the cost of performance.\u00a0Thus, \"scalability\" is multifaceted, and achieving it across computation, task performance, and training remains an open challenge.\nPerformance Trade-offs:\nWhile NCAs show promise in specific areas, they may not always match the peak performance (e.g., accuracy on standard benchmarks, image reconstruction fidelity) of highly optimized, specialized traditional models like state-of-the-art CNNs or Transformers.\u00a0There can be a trade-off between properties like robustness or efficiency and raw predictive accuracy.\nInterpretability\n(General NCAs):\nAlthough the underlying CA structure is simple, understanding\nhow\nthe complex dynamics emerge from the specific rules learned by the neural network in an NCA can still be challenging.\u00a0Analyzing the high-dimensional state vectors and the non-linear transformations of the NN rule is often less intuitive than, for example, visualizing feature maps in a CNN. DiffLogic CA is an attempt to improve interpretability.\nHardware Specialization:\nWhile NCAs run on GPUs, fully realizing the potential benefits of their massive parallelism might eventually require specialized hardware architectures designed specifically for CA-like computations.\u00a0The lack of readily available, optimized libraries has also been cited as hindering research exploration.\nThe choice between traditional NNs and CA-based models is therefore not straightforward but depends heavily on the specific application priorities. CA-based models appear particularly compelling for tasks where robustness, regeneration, self-organization, modeling\ndistributed systems\n, or achieving high parameter/resource efficiency are paramount, even if this entails potential compromises on peak performance measured by standard metrics or increased training complexity.\u00a0They offer a different set of inductive biases and computational properties that may be better suited to certain problem domains than those offered by conventional deep learning architectures.\nComparative Analysis Table\nTo synthesize these points, Table 1 provides a comparative overview of different CA-based approaches and traditional neural networks across key features.\nTable 1: Comparative Analysis of CA-Based ML Paradigms vs. Traditional Neural Networks\nVII. Current Research Landscape and Challenges\nThe exploration of Cellular Automata principles within machine learning, particularly through Neural Cellular Automata, constitutes a vibrant and rapidly evolving research area. This section surveys key advancements, identifies persistent challenges, and notes prominent contributors and publication venues.\nKey Advancements and Active Research Areas\nSignificant progress has been made in developing and applying CA-based ML models:\nFoundational NCA Development:\nThe core concept of NCAs \u2013 using learnable, typically neural network-based rules within a CA framework, trainable via gradient descent \u2013 represents the most significant advancement, bridging the gap between classical CA theory and modern deep learning practice.\nArchitectural Innovation:\nA major focus is on developing specialized NCA architectures. This includes incorporating attention mechanisms (ViTCA), operating in latent spaces for efficiency (LNCA), using differentiable logic gates for interpretability and discrete states (DiffLogic CA), designing NCAs as robustness-enhancing adaptors for other models (AdaNCA), creating rotation-invariant models (Isotropic NCAs), and\nenabling sensor movement\n(Active NCAs).\u00a0This diversification highlights active exploration of the design space.\nImproved Training Techniques:\nResearch addresses the challenges of training NCAs, exploring methods beyond basic BPTT. This includes using sample pools to encourage convergence to attractors, employing stochastic updates for regularization and robustness, developing diffusion-inspired training paradigms that may improve stability and reduce reliance on sample pools, and utilizing evolutionary algorithms where gradients are unavailable or problematic.\nExpanding Applications:\nThe application scope of NCAs is broadening considerably. Initial focus on morphogenesis and pattern generation\u00a0has expanded into diverse areas like medical image segmentation and classification, image restoration,\ndistributed robotics and sensing\n, generative modeling (including\ndiffusion model hybrids\n), artificial life simulations, and enhancing the robustness of mainstream models like ViTs.\nTheoretical Understanding:\nEfforts are underway to gain deeper theoretical insights into how NCAs learn and function. This includes analyzing the structure of learned networks in relation to CA rule complexity, investigating generalization properties, connecting NCA behavior to concepts like information theory (\nempowerment\n), and exploring the ability of other architectures like Transformers to learn CA dynamics.\nTools and Infrastructure:\nThe development of open-source, hardware-accelerated libraries like CAX\u00a0is crucial for lowering the barrier to entry, improving reproducibility, and enabling larger-scale experiments, thereby facilitating further research progress.\nThis rapid development, largely driven by the application of deep learning tools to the CA framework, indicates significant recent interest and cross-pollination of ideas.\nIdentified Challenges\nDespite progress, several significant challenges remain in the field of CA-based ML:\nTraining Stability and Efficiency:\nAchieving stable and efficient training remains a primary hurdle. NCAs trained with BPTT can suffer from gradient issues (vanishing/exploding) over long simulation times.\u00a0Convergence can be slow and sensitive to hyperparameters, often requiring careful tuning and specialized techniques like sample pools, which add complexity.\u00a0The black-box optimization methods proposed for EMs can be\nsample-inefficient\n.\nDeveloping more robust and efficient optimization algorithms tailored for these dynamical systems is critical.\nScalability:\nWhile CA principles suggest scalability, practical implementation faces obstacles. The computational cost of training, particularly BPTT, scales with the number of time steps, potentially limiting the complexity or duration of dynamics that can be learned.\u00a0Scaling trained models to significantly larger grid sizes while maintaining desired behavior and performance is not always straightforward and can be a bottleneck.\u00a0LNCA addresses computational scaling but compromises performance.\nRule Discovery and Controllability:\nThe fundamental \"inverse problem\" of CA \u2013 finding local rules that reliably produce a desired global behavior \u2013 persists even with learnable rules.\u00a0Training may converge to suboptimal solutions, or the emergent dynamics might be difficult to precisely control or predict.\u00a0Ensuring the learned rules lead to the intended outcome under various conditions is challenging.\nInterpretability:\nUnderstanding\nwhy\na learned NCA rule produces a specific emergent behavior remains difficult.\u00a0While the local rule might be a small NN, its iterative application leads to complex spatio-temporal dynamics that are hard to analyze. Variants like DiffLogic CA aim to improve this, but general interpretability is lacking.\nHardware Acceleration and Libraries:\nFully exploiting the parallelism of CA/NCA likely requires optimized hardware and software.\u00a0The historical lack of standardized, high-performance libraries has been identified as a barrier to research progress, although tools like CAX are beginning to address this.\nGeneralizability and Robustness:\nWhile NCAs show promise for robustness and generalization in specific contexts, ensuring these properties hold across diverse tasks, datasets, and real-world perturbations requires further investigation and rigorous evaluation.\nTheoretical Foundations:\nA deeper theoretical understanding of the learning dynamics, expressive capacity, limitations, and convergence properties of NCAs is still needed.\u00a0Formal analysis lags behind empirical exploration.\nThese challenges highlight the gap between the theoretical potential inherited from classical CA (scalability, robustness, emergence) and the practical difficulties encountered when integrating them with complex learning objectives and optimization methods from ML.\u00a0Overcoming these hurdles is the focus of much current research.\nProminent Research Groups and Venues\nResearch in CA-based ML is conducted in both industry and academic settings:\nIndustry Labs:\nGoogle Research\nhas been particularly active, contributing to key developments in Growing NCAs, Isotropic NCAs, DiffLogic CA, and collaborating on ViTCA.\u00a0Wolfram Research and the\nWolfram Institute\nare associated with the EM proposal and foundational CA work.\nSakana AI\nhas explored automated discovery in ALife substrates including NCAs.\nMicrosoft Research\nhas also been involved, e.g., through collaborations.\u00a0The involvement of these major players suggests perceived potential beyond purely academic interest.\nAcademic Labs/Researchers:\nNumerous academic researchers and labs contribute significantly. Key individuals can often be identified through authorship on seminal papers cited throughout this article (e.g., Mordvintsev, Randazzo, Tesfaldet, Gilpin, Hintze, Chan, Oudeyer). Institutions like Northwestern University, Lancaster University, Dalarna University/Michigan State University/Ume\u00e5 University (ENIGMA collaboration), INRIA (Flowers team), and initiatives like\nCross Labs\nare active in the field.\nPublication Venues:\nResearch findings are disseminated through major machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems), ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning), and ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations).\u00a0These are considered top-tier venues in AI/ML.\u00a0Work also appears in specialized venues like the Artificial Life (ALIFE) conference, computational science journals (e.g., PLoS Computational Biology), online platforms like\nDistill.pub\nand OpenReview, and preprint servers like arXiv.\nThe active research landscape, characterized by architectural innovation, expanding applications, and the involvement of both academia and industry, indicates a field gaining momentum, albeit one still grappling with fundamental challenges in training, control, and scaling.\nVIII. Future Directions and Implications\nThe exploration of Cellular Automata principles within machine learning opens up intriguing possibilities that extend beyond incremental improvements on existing tasks. This section considers the potential future impact of CA-based models like EMs and NCAs on ML theory and practice, discusses emerging applications, and reflects on the open questions and long-term vision driving the field.\nPotential Impact on Machine Learning Theory and Practice\nThe integration of CA concepts could influence the trajectory of ML in several ways:\nAlternative Computational Paradigm:\nCA-based models, particularly the\nvision articulated by EMs\n, offer a fundamentally different perspective on computation for AI. Instead of focusing solely on learning static input-output mappings via function approximation (the dominant view in deep learning), these models emphasize learning\ndynamic, iterative processes\nthat generate solutions through emergent behavior over time.\u00a0This shift could lead to new theoretical frameworks for understanding learning and intelligence, drawing more heavily on concepts from dynamical systems, computation theory, and complex systems science.\nNovel Inductive Biases:\nThe inherent structure of CA/NCA \u2013 based on locality, parallelism, and iterative updates \u2013 provides strong inductive biases. These biases might be particularly well-suited for certain types of problems where traditional architectures struggle, such as modeling physical systems with local interactions, processing spatio-temporal data where patterns evolve dynamically, or designing self-organizing systems.\u00a0Understanding and leveraging these biases could lead to more efficient and effective models for specific domains.\nInsights into Biological Intelligence:\nThe parallels between CA/NCA dynamics (especially morphogenesis and self-organization) and biological processes offer a potential avenue for gaining\ninsights into natural intelligence\n, development, and evolution.\u00a0Models like ENIGMA, which incorporate gene regulatory networks, explicitly aim to bridge this gap. Studying how complex behaviors emerge in these artificial systems might inform our understanding of their biological counterparts.\nHybrid Architectures:\nRather than replacing traditional DNNs entirely, CA/NCA components might be integrated into hybrid architectures. The AdaNCA model, which uses NCA modules to enhance the robustness of Vision Transformers, exemplifies this approach. Future research could explore other ways to combine the feature extraction power of DNNs with the dynamic, robust properties of NCAs.\nEmerging Applications\nThe unique capabilities of CA-based models suggest several potentially transformative future applications:\nProgrammable Matter and Novel Hardware:\nA long-term vision, explicitly linked to variants like DiffLogic CA, is the realization of\nprogrammable matter\nor \"Computronium\".\u00a0This involves designing materials whose physical behavior can be programmed at the micro-level using CA-like local rules, enabling materials that can compute, change shape, or self-repair. This could lead to revolutionary computing architectures fundamentally different from current silicon-based systems.\nArtificial Life and Open-Ended Evolution:\nCA and NCAs provide powerful substrates for Artificial Life research.\u00a0Future work could push towards more complex simulations of life-like phenomena, including self-replication with variation (true self-reproduction), adaptation, and potentially\nopen-ended evolution\n\u2013 systems\ncapable of generating unbounded novelty and complexity\nover time\n.\u00a0Achieving milestones like robust self-reproduction and\nautopoiesis\n(self-maintenance) in artificial systems remains a major challenge.\nAutomated discovery tools like ASAL\ncould accelerate progress in exploring the vast space of possible artificial life forms.\nAdvanced Robotics and Distributed Systems:\nThe principles of local control, self-organization, and robustness inherent in CA/NCA are highly relevant for designing next-generation robotic systems. This includes\nswarm robotics\n, modular robots that can\nself-assemble\nor\nreconfigure\n, and soft robots capable of adaptation and self-repair after damage.\u00a0NCAs could provide\ndecentralized\ncontrol mechanisms that are inherently scalable and fault-tolerant.\nRegenerative Medicine and Developmental Biology:\nThe success of NCAs in modeling morphogenesis and regeneration\u00a0suggests potential applications in understanding biological development and designing interventions for regenerative medicine.\u00a0By learning the \"rules\" of development from data, NCAs could serve as\nin silico\nmodels for testing hypotheses or designing strategies to guide tissue growth and repair.\nResource-Constrained AI (\nEdge AI, TinyML\n):\nThe potential parameter efficiency and reliance on local computations make NCAs attractive candidates for deployment on edge devices with limited power, memory, and connectivity.\u00a0Variants like LNCA\u00a0and the inherent efficiency of DiffLogic CA\u00a0align well with the growing trend of TinyML.\nGenerative Models:\nNCAs offer a different approach to generative modeling, focusing on growth and iterative refinement rather than direct synthesis via feedforward networks. Further research could enhance their capabilities for generating complex, high-fidelity content, potentially including video or other dynamic data types.\nScientific Simulation:\nData-driven NCAs could emerge as powerful tools for simulating complex dynamical systems in various scientific domains where traditional modeling is difficult or computationally prohibitive.\u00a0They could learn effective models directly from experimental or simulation data.\nMany of these futuristic applications, particularly programmable matter and advanced artificial life, represent long-term goals that hinge critically on overcoming the fundamental challenges in training, scalability, and control identified previously.\nThe Road Ahead: Open Questions and Long-Term Vision\nSeveral key questions and directions will shape the future of this field:\nAGI Potential:\nThe claim that CA-based models like EMs offer a path towards Artificial General Intelligence needs rigorous scrutiny.\u00a0What specific properties \u2013 Turing completeness, emergent meta-learning, inherent robustness \u2013 are truly necessary or sufficient for AGI, and can these models demonstrably achieve them in complex,\nopen-ended\nenvironments?\nBridging Theory and Practice:\nHow can the profound theoretical capabilities of universal CA be effectively translated into practical, reliable, and high-performing ML systems? Closing the gap between theoretical potential and empirical realization is crucial.\nOvercoming Core Challenges:\nSustained research is needed to address the major hurdles of training stability and efficiency, practical scalability, predictable control over emergence, and interpretability.\u00a0This likely requires new algorithms, theoretical insights, and potentially specialized hardware.\nIntegration with Other AI:\nHow can CA-based models be effectively integrated with other AI paradigms? This includes exploring interactions with\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)\n, leveraging them within\nreinforcement learning\nframeworks beyond simple benchmarks, and potentially combining their emergent dynamics with symbolic reasoning approaches.\nEthical Considerations\n:\nAs CA-based systems become more autonomous, capable of self-organization, regeneration, and potentially exhibiting life-like properties, ethical considerations regarding their control, deployment (especially in robotics and autonomous systems), and potential unforeseen consequences will become increasingly important.\nAlignment with Broader Trends:\nWhile specific CA-based applications are emerging, connecting this research to broader AI trends like multimodal AI, AI for science, automation, and cybersecurity could reveal further opportunities.\nThe most probable near-to-mid-term impact of CA-based ML may lie in specialized domains where their unique strengths provide a clear advantage. Rather than replacing established DNNs across the board, NCAs and related models could become the preferred tools for tasks demanding exceptional robustness, generative capabilities based on local rules (like morphogenesis or texture synthesis), efficient modeling of distributed systems, or operation under severe resource constraints.\nIX. Final words\nThis article has undertaken an analysis of emergent models in machine learning derived from the principles of Cellular Automata. Starting with the foundational concepts, CA are discrete dynamical systems characterized by local interactions on a grid, capable of generating complex emergent behavior from simple rules and, in some cases, achieving universal computation.\u00a0Emergence, the arising of macroscopic properties from microscopic interactions, is a key feature of CA and a phenomenon of interest for developing more adaptive and intelligent artificial systems. Two main paradigms for leveraging CA in ML were examined.\nEmergent Models (EMs)\nrepresent a theoretical proposal to replace neural networks entirely, using iterative application of simple, fixed rules over large state spaces, inspired by CA and Turing machines, with the hypothesis of achieving superior generalization and emergent meta-learning capabilities.\nNeural Cellular Automata (NCAs)\noffer a more established, practical approach, integrating learnable neural network rules within the CA framework, enabling the discovery of local dynamics that lead to desired global outcomes via gradient-based optimization.\u00a0The field of NCAs is rapidly diversifying with specialized variants targeting efficiency (LNCA), attention mechanisms (ViTCA), discrete logic (DiffLogic CA), robustness enhancement (AdaNCA), and specific applications like morphogenesis and medical imaging.\nThe evaluation of CA-based ML reveals a distinct profile of potential strengths and weaknesses. Key advantages often stem from the core CA principles: inherent\nparallelism\nsuitable for hardware acceleration, potential for\nrobustness\nand\nregeneration\ndue to distributed local control, promising\ngeneralization\nin certain contexts (e.g., OOD data), and often significant\nparameter efficiency\ncompared to large DNNs.\u00a0These models excel at capturing\nemergent phenomena\nand modeling self-organizing systems. However, significant challenges persist.\nTraining\nNCAs can be unstable and computationally demanding, requiring specialized techniques.\u00a0Achieving practical\nscalability\nto very large systems remains difficult.\u00a0Precisely\ncontrolling\nthe emergent behavior and ensuring predictable outcomes is non-trivial.\u00a0Furthermore,\ninterpretability\nof the learned dynamics can be challenging, and peak performance on standard benchmarks may sometimes lag behind highly optimized traditional models.\nThe research landscape is active, driven by both academic inquiry and industry interest, with rapid advancements in architectures, training methods, and applications.\u00a0However, the field is still maturing, grappling with the fundamental challenges of reliably harnessing the power of emergence within a learning framework.\nLooking forward, CA-based models hold the potential to impact ML theory by offering alternative computational paradigms focused on dynamics and emergence.\u00a0Future applications may range from practical uses in robust medical imaging, resource-constrained AI, and generative design to more ambitious, long-term goals like programmable matter, advanced artificial life, and novel forms of\ndistributed robotics\n.\u00a0Achieving this potential hinges on continued research to overcome the core challenges related to training, scalability, control, and theoretical understanding. Cellular Automata-based approaches represent a compelling and distinct direction within machine learning. While unlikely to replace mainstream deep learning methods across all domains in the near future, their unique properties \u2013 particularly robustness, parallelism, parameter efficiency, and the capacity for emergent self-organization \u2013 make them a valuable alternative and complementary paradigm. They offer a powerful lens for exploring complexity, intelligence, and life-like computation, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in specific application areas and enriching our understanding of computation itself. The continued exploration of Emergent Models, Neural Cellular Automata, and their future iterations promises to be a fascinating and potentially fruitful endeavor in the ongoing quest for more capable, adaptable, and robust artificial intelligence.\nRecent Posts\nSee All\nThe Silent Killer: Why Inertia Might Be the Most Deadly Sin for Any Business, Big or Small\nThe \"AI Hunger Games\"

Meanwhile, JPR puts Intel's graphics market share at essentially zero, with Nvidia hoovering up the remaining 92%. Ouch.\nBefore we all escalate the threat level to PC gaming to DEFCON 1 and panic, it should be noted that JPR's figures cover the period up to the end of March. [AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-radeon-rx-9700-xt-review-asus-prime-oc/) were only released on March 6. So, that's only three and a bit weeks of RDNA 4 sales in the figures.\nIn other words, we'll have to wait for the Q2 numbers to get a full picture of how much impact AMD's new GPUs have had. Indeed, we'll arguably have to wait even longer than that, since it's the [RX 9060 XT](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16-gb-review-xfx-swift/), which only went on sale yesterday, that's meant to be the real volume play for AMD and that won't have a substantial impact on market share figures until the Q3 data is out.\nOverall, GPU sales were up 8.5% in Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024. JPR says that Q1 is usually flat or down compared to the previous quarter, but that, \"In Q1\u201925, AMD and Nvidia introduced new AIBs, which stimulated the market.\"\nIf we'll have to wait a little longer to see how the RX 9070 and 9060 GPUs fare for AMD, the verdict on [Intel's Arc B570 and B580 GPUs](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/intel-arc-b580-review/) is surely in and it not good news, not good news at all.\nThe blip that was 1% Intel market share has vanished from the latest GPU sales figures. (Image credit: JPR)\nJPR reckons Intel's market share fell by 1.2% in the latest quarter, essentially putting it on 0% and not appearing in the data for Q1 2025. If there was already doubt over Intel's commitment to the add-in graphics card market, this apparent total failure of Intel's second-gen Battlemage generation of GPUs is extremely troubling.\nBattlemage GPUs went on sale at the end of 2024. So, in theory Q1 2025 was a full quarter for sales of Intel's latest graphics hardware. Obviously sales of the B570 and B580 haven't actually been zero. But if JPR is to be believed, the volumes are so small as to effectively push Intel out of its data.\nIf even half a percent of sales were going to Intel, JPR would no doubt have included that in its data. So, we're talking less than one in 200 GPUs sales being Intel cards, and quite possibly an order of magnitude or more worse than that.\nIt really is a grim outlook for Intel graphics and puts [rumours of more powerful Battlemage GPUs into context](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/a-high-performance-intel-battlemage-gaming-gpu-has-allegedly-been-spotted-and-i-really-want-it-to-be-a-usd400-rtx-5070-killer/). With sales this low, is it remotely realistic to expect Intel to wheel out that purported Nvidia RTX 4070 / 5070 killer? It doesn't seem terribly plausible in the light of this latest data.\nStill, the numbers we're really looking forward to will be Q3 2025, when both of AMD's new RDNA 4 GPUs will have had at least a full quarter on sale. That data probably won't be out until the end of the year.

Two Headsets, One Couch\nNick deCourville\n3 minute read\nJun 9th, 2025 5:59 PM EDT\n|\nNews\nPhoto Credit: Apple\nPicture this: it\u2019s date night with your loved one and you\u2019re snuggling up to the latest\nFast and Furious\nreboot with both of you throwing on your Apple Vision Pros. Sound romantic? Apple\u2019s latest conference has come and gone, and along with it came some rather exciting updates for its flagship headset. Exciting as the news may be, it\u2019s hard not to feel that Apple is searching for an audience with the Vision Pro; and those already alienated by current tech trends may double down on their fears.\nDuring WWDC 2025, Apple announced visionOS 26, which has myriad of new features including\nEye Scrolling and Spatial Widgets\n, among others. However, one feature really stands out to me, especially the way it was advertised, and that\u2019s the ability for Vision Pro users to share the same spatial environment.\nGrab the (Augmented) Popcorn: What to Do with the Vision Pro\nApple touted this new conjoined reality feature by showcasing two individuals on a couch watching the same movie. For me, it\u2019s hard for this not to seem alienating\u2014jogging my memory with hints of Mark Zuckerberg\ninsisting we all want to work in the metaverse\n. Isn\u2019t this the exact thing\nJony Ive is trying to pull us away from\n? No, not really. However, given that many across the internet already find technology to be somewhat alienating these days, the idea of tying oneself to a device alongside another individual doesn\u2019t exactly scream intimacy.\nFrom the WWDC 2025 feed, it\u2019s obvious that Apple is merely showcasing examples of the Vision Pro\u2019s capabilities. While I doubt that there will be a wealth of people chomping at the bit to watch the latest Brad Pitt vehicle in such a united-yet-separated environment, Apple quickly shifted to more practical applications with the Vision Pro, such as one individual showing another a 3D schematic of a vehicle\u2019s braking system.\nFor me, this says two things about the Vision Pro. One, I don\u2019t think Apple is even quite sure of the full capabilities of the device, and two, it\u2019s increasingly obvious that the Vision Pro is still well in its infancy. Is it so early in its infancy that it should not have seen release to the public? With the popularity of tech companies releasing alpha/beta products to the masses (looking at you,\nHumane AI\n), the Vision Pro was\nalways meant for early adopters\n. But for a company like Apple, the delivery and execution seems strange.\nWho Exactly is the Vision Pro for?\nConsidering the currently available Vision Pro is still something of a hassle to carry around\u2014the headset is still rather large and\nthat thick battery\nisn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014it\u2019s a weird sight to see a company as large as Apple essentially say, \u201chere\u2019s what we think this device is going to be great at. . . some day\u201d. Referring back to the two individuals teaching each other vehicle maintenance, this is in fact a great use for the Vision Pro. However, the current generation headset seems far from practical for such an endeavor. Those who know a few mechanics in their life should picture them using a Vision Pro to teach someone right now. Did you laugh?\nFor me, I think the problem is that a general populace isn\u2019t so willing to adopt the Vision Pro the same way they did an iPhone, and it isn\u2019t necessarily meant to. Though that begs the question, will the Vision Pro gain mass adopters, and what are they going to look like? As someone who tries their best to stay up-to-date with tech, it doesn\u2019t seem like augmented and virtual realities are gaining traction in terms of popularity, and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to change that.\nStaying After the Credits\nPerhaps it\u2019s a generation growing tired of technology invading all areas of their life. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that Vision Pro may have been released too soon. Maybe I\u2019m an idiot and the Vision Pro is selling tens of thousands of units a day: it could even be a combination of all three.\nWhatever the answer may be, the Vision Pro as is certainly needs some changes before it becomes that perfect date night destination, or even a proper teaching instrument in a classroom. While releasing the product early is likely helping smaller developers create great things for the device, things like floating heads and semi-confusing sales pitches are probably not helping its case in terms of winning over the curious.\nThe future of AR/VR headsets is still incredibly bright, though I can\u2019t help but feel that every company\u2019s insistence that we be the (paying) test subjects is casting dark clouds. While the Vision Pro has an opportunity to turn these clouds into a rainbow, I think it would do Apple good to stop alienating a general audience.\n240883\nNick deCourville\nnews\n0\n1749491405", "ped_digest": "P:Apple is searching for an audience with the Vision Pro|VisionOS 26 was announced with new features like Eye Scrolling and Spatial Widgets|Vision Pro users can now share the same spatial environment|Apple showcased the Vision Pro's capabilities with examples like teaching vehicle maintenance|The Vision Pro is still in its infancy|The Vision Pro may have been released too soon|AR/VR headsets need changes before widespread adoption;E:WWDC 2025 conference|Apple announced visionOS 26|Showcasing two individuals watching a movie together|Demonstration of a 3D schematic of a vehicle\u2019s braking system;D:Vision Pro|visionOS 26|Eye Scrolling|Spatial Widgets|Fast and Furious reboot|Brad Pitt vehicle|3D schematic of a vehicle\u2019s braking system|Alpha/beta products|Humane AI;", "er_digest": "N:Brad Pitt|Vision Pro|Mark Zuckerberg|Apple|Nick deCourville|Jony Ive;R:United States;", "gist": "P:Apple is searching for an audience with the Vision Pro|VisionOS 26 was announced with new features like Eye Scrolling and Spatial Widgets|Vision Pro users can now share the same spatial environment|Apple showcased the Vision Pro's capabilities with examples like teaching vehicle maintenance|The Vision Pro is still in its infancy|The Vision Pro may have been released too soon|AR/VR headsets need changes before widespread adoption;E:WWDC 2025 conference|Apple announced visionOS 26|Showcasing two individuals watching a movie together|Demonstration of a 3D schematic of a vehicle\u2019s braking system;D:Vision Pro|visionOS 26|Eye Scrolling|Spatial Widgets|Fast and Furious reboot|Brad Pitt vehicle|3D schematic of a vehicle\u2019s braking system|Alpha/beta products|Humane AI;N:Brad Pitt|Vision Pro|Mark Zuckerberg|Apple|Nick deCourville|Jony Ive;R:United States;", "entities": ["Brad Pitt", "Vision Pro", "Mark Zuckerberg", "Apple", "Nick deCourville", "Jony Ive"], "regions": ["United States"]}, {"_id": "https://www.independent.co.ug/five-dead-in-nakasongola-as-taxi-slams-into-milk-truck/", "content": "Nakasongola, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT |\nAt least five passengers died on the spot, and six others were seriously injured after a taxi collided with a milk truck on Sunday night.\u00a0 The accident occurred around 8:30 p.m. at Kyalweza Village in Nakasongola District along the Kampala\u2013Gulu highway.\nIt involved a Toyota Hiace taxi, registration number UA 415AV, traveling from Kampala to Kigumba, and a Nissan milk truck, registration number UBL 615T, heading toward Kampala.\u00a0According to Savannah Regional Police Spokesperson, Sam Twineamazima, the crash happened when the taxi driver, who was reportedly speeding toward Gulu, lost control and collided head-on with the oncoming milk truck.\nTwineamazima confirmed that five people died instantly, and their bodies were taken to Nakasongola Health Centre IV for postmortem. Six others sustained critical injuries and were rushed to both Nakasongola Health Centre IV and Kiryandongo Hospital for treatment.\nPolice also towed the wreckage of the two vehicles to Katuugo Police Station as investigations continued.

The disease rate has risen massively since the Industrial Revolution, in particular childhood cancer \u2013 proving that the rise is not simply due to people living longer.\nProfessor Rosalie David\n, at the Faculty of Life Sciences, said: \u201cIn industrialised societies, cancer is second only to cardiovascular disease as a cause of death. But in ancient times, it was extremely rare. There is nothing in the natural environment that can cause cancer. So it has to be a man-made disease, down to pollution and changes to our diet and lifestyle.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe important thing about our study is that it gives a historical perspective to this disease. We can make very clear statements on the cancer rates in societies because we have a full overview. We have looked at millennia, not one hundred years, and have masses of data.\u201d\nEgyptian mummys\nThe data includes the first ever histological diagnosis of cancer in an Egyptian mummy by Professor Michael Zimmerman, a visiting Professor at the KNH Centre, who is based at the Villanova University in the US. He diagnosed rectal cancer in an unnamed mummy, an \u2018ordinary\u2019 person who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period (200-400 CE).\nProfessor Zimmerman said:\u00a0\u201cIn an ancient society lacking surgical intervention, evidence of cancer should remain in all cases.\u00a0The virtual absence of malignancies in mummies must be interpreted as indicating their rarity in antiquity, indicating that cancer causing factors are limited to societies affected by modern industrialization\u201d.\nThe team studied both mummified remains and literary evidence for ancient Egypt but only literary evidence for ancient Greece as there are no remains for this period, as well as medical studies of human and animal remains from earlier periods, going back to the age of the dinosaurs.\nEvidence of cancer in animal fossils, non-human primates and early humans is scarce \u2013 a few dozen, mostly disputed, examples in animal fossils, although a metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin has been reported in an Edmontosaurus fossil while another study lists a number of possible neoplasms in fossil remains.\u00a0Various malignancies have been reported in non-human primates but do not include many of the cancers most commonly identified in modern adult humans.\nIt has been suggested that the short life span of individuals in antiquity precluded the development of cancer.\u00a0Although this statistical construct is true, individuals in ancient Egypt and Greece did live long enough to develop such diseases as atherosclerosis, Paget's disease of bone, and osteoporosis, and, in modern populations, bone tumours primarily affect the young.\n\u201c\nThe important thing about our study is that it gives a historical perspective to this disease. We can make very clear statements on the cancer rates in societies because we have a full overview. We have looked at millennia, not one hundred years, and have masses of data.\nProfessor Rosalie David\n\u201e\nAnother explanation for the lack of tumours in ancient remains is that tumours might not be well preserved.\u00a0Dr. Zimmerman has performed experimental studies indicating that mummification preserves the features of malignancy and that tumours should actually be better preserved than normal tissues.\u00a0In spite of this finding, hundreds of mummies from all areas of the world have been examined and there are still only two publications showing microscopic confirmation of cancer.\u00a0Radiological surveys of mummies from the Cairo Museum and museums in Europe have also failed to reveal evidence of cancer.\nAs the team moved through the ages, it was not until the 17\nth\nCentury that they found descriptions of operations for breast and other cancers and the first reports in scientific literature of distinctive tumours have only occurred in the past 200 years, such as scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps in 1775, nasal cancer in snuff users in 1761 and Hodgkin\u2019s disease in 1832.\nThe fathers of pharmacology\nProfessor David \u2013 who was invited to present her paper to UK Cancer Czar Professor Mike Richards and other oncologists at this year\u2019s UK Association of Cancer Registries and National Cancer Intelligence Network conference \u2013 said: \u201cWhere there are cases of cancer in ancient Egyptian remains, we are not sure what caused them. They did heat their homes with fires, which gave off smoke, and temples burned incense, but sometimes illnesses are just thrown up.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe ancient Egyptian data offers both physical and literary evidence, giving a unique opportunity to look at the diseases they had and the treatments they tried. They were the fathers of pharmacology so some treatments did work\n\u201cThey were very inventive and some treatments thought of as magical were genuine therapeutic remedies. For example, celery was used to treat rheumatism back then and is being investigated today. Their surgery and the binding of fractures were excellent because they knew their anatomy: there was no taboo on working with human bodies because of mummification. They were very hands on and it gave them a different mindset to working with bodies than the Greeks, who had to come to Alexandria to study medicine.\u201d\nShe concluded: \u201cYet again extensive ancient Egyptian data, along with other data from across the millennia, has given modern society a clear message \u2013 cancer is man-made and something that we can and should address.\u201d\nA copy of the paper \u2018Cancer: an old disease, a new disease or something in between?\u2019\ndoi:10.1038/nrc2914\nis available at\nhttp://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v10/n10/full/nrc2914.html\nShare this page\nScientists suggest that cancer is man-made\nShare on: X\nShare on: Facebook\nShare on: LinkedIn\nFurther reading\nMore news about cancer\nopens in new window\nClose menu\nHome\nAbout\nNews\nNewsroom\nNews Archive\nMedia Library", "ped_digest": "P:Cancer is a modern, man-made disease|Cancer rates have risen massively since the Industrial Revolution|Cancer is second only to cardiovascular disease as a cause of death in industrialised societies|Cancer is man-made and something that we can and should address;E:University of Manchester scientists conducted a study review|Study published in Nature Reviews Cancer|Professor Rosalie David presented her paper at the UK Association of Cancer Registries and National Cancer Intelligence Network conference|Team studied mummified remains and literary evidence;D:Cancer was extremely rare in antiquity|Few references to cancer in literary evidence|Cancer rate rise since the Industrial Revolution|Cancer rates in societies have a full overview|Study looked at millennia, not one hundred years|First histological diagnosis of cancer in an Egyptian mummy|Rectal cancer diagnosed in an unnamed mummy|Short life span of individuals in antiquity may have precluded cancer development;", "er_digest": "N:University of Manchester;R:Cairo|Europe|Egypt|Greece;", "gist": "P:Cancer is a modern, man-made disease|Cancer rates have risen massively since the Industrial Revolution|Cancer is second only to cardiovascular disease as a cause of death in industrialised societies|Cancer is man-made and something that we can and should address;E:University of Manchester scientists conducted a study review|Study published in Nature Reviews Cancer|Professor Rosalie David presented her paper at the UK Association of Cancer Registries and National Cancer Intelligence Network conference|Team studied mummified remains and literary evidence;D:Cancer was extremely rare in antiquity|Few references to cancer in literary evidence|Cancer rate rise since the Industrial Revolution|Cancer rates in societies have a full overview|Study looked at millennia, not one hundred years|First histological diagnosis of cancer in an Egyptian mummy|Rectal cancer diagnosed in an unnamed mummy|Short life span of individuals in antiquity may have precluded cancer development;N:University of Manchester;R:Cairo|Europe|Egypt|Greece;", "entities": ["University of Manchester"], "regions": ["Cairo", "Europe", "Egypt", "Greece"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cato.org/blog/deportations-add-almost-1-trillion-costs-gops-big-beautiful-bill", "content": "In this analysis by CATO they highlight the secondary costs associated with the mass deportation plan proposed by the Trump Administration. They look at the proposed costs of the bill and highlight the questionable accounting that the CBO proposed would be used. They point out that with this bill immigration enforcement would become a huge percentage of all law enforcement spending, reaching nearly half of what all states spend on local enforcement and many times more than the DEA or FBI. They also bring up the CBO estimates for immigration under Biden, where there would have an overall savings from the immigrantion occurring.\n\nIn general this shows that the Trump Administration's immigration policy will cause a significant increase in the deficit, potentially past current estimates, will slow economic growth due to both direct removal and indirect secondary effects, and will create a huge immigration enforcement arm of the government that will need maintained by future administrations. Additionally it appears there may be further unanticipated costs, such as National Guard deployments. Should Congressional Republicans be advocating for a smaller budget for immigration enforcement?

And why? Because people are protesting his immigration crackdown. Congresswoman\nJasmine Crockett\n, known for her sharp rhetoric and no-nonsense commentary, took to the social media platform X to break down what she sees as a calculated series of events.\nFirst they illegally deport citizens. Then they unleash ICE to terrorize communities. Now they\u2019ve got the National Guard in L.A. to silence protestors.\nThis ain\u2019t about law and order.\nThis is what authoritarianism looks like.\n\u2014 Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (@RepJasmine)\nJune 8, 2025\nFor three nights straight, downtown LA has been a battleground. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets, furious over what\nthey see as a brutal and inhumane campaign\ntargeting immigrant communities. By Sunday night, tear gas was in the air, rubber bullets were flying, and the city was left smoldering.\nHere\u2019s the thing: deploying the National Guard into a state without the governor\u2019s consent is not normal. In fact, it\u2019s so not normal that it hasn\u2019t happened since 1965, when Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to Alabama during the civil rights movement. But let\u2019s be clear: those troops were sent to protect civil rights activists and enforce desegregation.\nTrump\u2019s move? It\u2019s the opposite\n.\nInvoking a rarely used federal provision, Trump claimed there was a \u201crebellion or danger of rebellion\u201d against the government. Translation: protests against his policies are inconvenient, so he\u2019s sending in troops to shut them down. Governor Newsom isn\u2019t having it. He went on MSNBC to declare Trump\u2019s actions illegal, immoral, and unconstitutional, and he\u2019s filing a lawsuit to back that up. Newsom also pointed out that this isn\u2019t about keeping the peace. It\u2019s about stoking chaos. Trump thrives on disorder\u2014it gives him an excuse to play the strongman, to paint himself as the savior of a nation he\u2019s actively destabilizing.\nWhile Trump rants on Truth Social about \u201cthugs\u201d and demands mass arrests, real people are living in fear. Immigrant communities in California are already on edge, thanks to an uptick in deportations and ICE raids. Now, they\u2019re watching their neighborhoods turn into militarized zones. So yeah, Crockett\nwas right to sound the alarm\n. And if we\u2019re not careful, this playbook could become the new normal.

Stocks: Another Bankruptcy among our 8 Imploded Solar Stocks\nby Wolf Richter\u00a0\u2022\nJun 9, 2025\n\u2022\n7 Comments\nThe stock market\u2019s solar craziness gets cleaned out stock by stock, even as solar-power generation continues to soar.\nBy\nWolf Richter\nfor\nWOLF STREET\n.\nSunnova Energy International, which booked huge losses every single year selling residential solar energy equipment and services \u2013 $1.61 billion in total losses since 2017 \u2013 said on Sunday that it and its subsidiaries Sunnova Energy Corporation and Sunnova Intermediate Holdings, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Texas. Its subsidiary Sunnova TEP Developer had already filed for bankruptcy on June 1. In the filing, it said that it would continue operating as \u201cdebtor in possession\u201d while trying to sell some of its assets under court supervision.\nThe marvel was of course its stock [\nNOVA\n] during the free-money pandemic. It went public in July 2019 at $12 a share and traded around $10 until the free money during the pandemic came along and caused the share price to spike five-fold to $55 by February 2021. That month, right at the peak, the Texas-based company acquired SunStreet from homebuilder Lennar, and Lennar washed its hands off it. Then the shares went to heck and were inducted into our pantheon of\nImploded Stocks\n(minimum requirement: -70% from peak).\nShares last traded on Friday at 22 cents. The company said it expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and that holders of its shares \u201ccould experience a significant or complete loss on their investment, depending on the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases\u201d (data via\nYCharts\n).\nDuring the years of losses, the company racked up $8.5 billion in debt, as per its last financial statement through December 31 \u2013 it failed to file its Q1 financials \u2013 amounting to over 10 times its 2024 revenues of $840 million.\nIn addition, the company had $2.1 billion in other liabilities, for total liabilities of $10.7 billion, as of its year-end financial statements.\nOther solar stocks have collapsed as well. But solar power, in terms of electricity generation, keeps rocking higher.\nSolar power generation surged 26.9% in 2024\nto 303,167 GWh, utility scale and rooftop solar combined. This is not \u201ccapacity\u201d but electricity generated and used. Solar\u2019s share ballooned to nearly 7% of the total electricity generated in 2024, surpassing hydropower [my report with charts:\nUS Power Generation by Source in 2024\n].\nIn addition, utility-scale batteries have become a profitable way of arbitraging the highly volatile electricity spot prices that can spike during high-demand hours and plunge during low-demand hours, often on the same day. In this arbitrage, batteries work well with big solar installations, buying electricity when the price is low, and selling it often just hours later when the price is high. And batteries work well with small-scale solar too. Some of the solar companies here are involved with both solar power and energy storage.\nThere are up-front costs with solar power, as there are with every power plant. When it comes to energy, there are no free lunches. But with solar, the \u201cfuel\u201d is free for the life of the installation, and the math has been getting better as the price of photovoltaic panels has come down over the decades.\nBig utilities are all over solar power, as are big equipment providers, such as Tesla. But these eight Imploded Stocks here are specialized players, many of them with over 1,000 employees at the peak, and with hundreds of millions to several billion in annual revenues.\nStock market solar craziness.\nSunPower is already a goner.\nIt filed for bankruptcy in August 2024. Most of its assets were acquired by solar SPAC Complete Solaria for $45 million (more in a moment), and SunPower\u2019s shares got wiped out.\nOne of the early solar big boys, it went public in 2005 as a spin-off from Cypress Semiconductor. Its stock experienced two bubbles: #1 in 2006-2007 when it went from $20 a share to $100; and #2 during the free-money pandemic when the stock multiplied by 12, from $4 a share to $54. In the end, it was felled by a toxic mix of operational issues, years of losses, accounting issues, missed filing deadlines, defaults, etc. (data via YCharts).\nComplete Solaria\n[\nSPWR\n], which acquired SunPower\u2019s assets, had gone public via merger with a SPAC in July 2023, as a residential solar systems provider. After the acquisition, it started doing business as SunPower and changed its ticker to SunPower\u2019s former ticker SPWR.\nSince the SPAC-merger, the stock has plunged by 82% to $1.93 today.\nSolarEdge Technologies\n[\nSEDG\n], which makes inverters, batteries, power optimizers, and other equipment for solar systems, went public in 2015 via IPO amid a deal with Tesla Energy to provide inverters for Tesla\u2019s Powerwall. But eventually, Tesla produced its own inverter. And that was that.\nThe company, headquartered in Israel and largely active in Europe, became sort of a rollup acquiring companies in Korea (Kokam), Italy (SMRE), and the UK (Hark Systems).\nIn 2024, it lost $1.8 billion, dwarfing the little bitty income it had booked in prior years. And sales collapsed by 70% in 2024.\nWhat\u2019s notable is the stock price, which had multiplied by 10 between early 2019 ($36 a share) and January 2021 ($360 a share), before collapsing by 95% to $18.72 today:\nSunrun\n[\nRUN\n], a residential solar systems installer based in San Francisco, went public via IPO in 2015, and over the past five years, lost $4.5 billion, including $2.85 billion in 2024.\nThe stock had multiplied by 11 between April 2020 ($8.36) and January 2021 ($96.50), but then collapsed and today closed at $8.27. Maybe investors should have taken the ticker literally?\nEnphase Energy\n[\nENPH\n], which makes equipment for residential and business solar and storage systems, and also EV chargers, went public via IPO in 2012. But then in 2019, stock took off and eventually, fueled by the free-money pandemic, multiplied by 48, to $336 in December 2022. Today, it closed at $43.26, down by 86% from that high.\nThe company has been profitable, but revenues collapsed by 42% in 2024, to $1.33 billion.\nShoals Technologies\n[\nSHLS\n], maker of equipment for solar systems, including utility-scale systems, went public via IPO in January 2021 at $25 a share, spiked to $40.17 within a few weeks, and then tanked, and closed at $5.10 today, down by 87%.\nThe company had been mildly profitable in recent years, but annual revenues plunged 18% in 2024 to $399 million.\nArray Technologies\n[\nARRY\n], maker of ground-mounting systems for solar installations, went public via IPO in October 2020, at $22 a share and quickly rose $51.01 in January 2021, before it kathoomphed.\nThe IPO during the free-money pandemic raised over $1 billion amid huge demand for the shares. It was also when PE firm Oaktree Capital, which had backed Array, began dumping its shares at peak prices.\nAnnual revenues have plunged by 44% over the past two years, to $915 million in 2024, and it lost $240 million last year. The stock has now plunged by 85% from the January 2021 high, to $7.49.\nEnjoy reading WOLF STREET and want to support it? You can donate. I appreciate it immensely.

Refer to the extensive comments within that file for detailed explanations of each option and placeholder.\nUsage\nYou can use the CodeGenerator Facade to generate codes.\nGenerating a Predefined Code Type\nThis is the most common and recommended way to generate codes, using patterns defined in your config/codegenerator.php.\nuse vsent\\Codegenerator\\Facades\\CodeGenerator;\n// Generate an Order Code (uses 'order' pattern from config)\ntry {\n$orderCode = CodeGenerator::generateFor('order');\n// Example: ORD-250609-HQ-0001\n} catch (\\RuntimeException $e) {\n// Handle error (e.g., max attempts reached, database error)\necho \"Error generating order code: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n// Generate an Invoice Number (uses 'invoice' pattern from config)\ntry {\n$invoiceNumber = CodeGenerator::generateFor('invoice');\n// Example: INV-202506-MUM-00001\n} catch (\\RuntimeException $e) {\necho \"Error generating invoice: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n// Generate a Tracking ID (uses 'tracking_id' pattern, which generates UUIDs)\ntry {\n$trackingId = CodeGenerator::generateFor('tracking_id');\n// Example: TRK-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef\n} catch (\\RuntimeException $e) {\necho \"Error generating tracking ID: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\nGenerating with Runtime Overrides\nYou can temporarily override specific configuration settings for a single generation call.\nuse vsent\\Codegenerator\\Facades\\CodeGenerator;\n// Generate a Purchase Order code, but specify a different location for this instance\ntry {\n$poCodeForLondon = CodeGenerator::generateFor('purchase_order', [\n'location' => 'LDN', // Override the default 'NYC' for this generation\n'sequence_length' => 6 // Override default 5-digit sequence\n]);\n// Example: PO/LDN/20250609/000001\n} catch (\\RuntimeException $e) {\necho \"Error generating PO code: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\nGenerating with an Inline (Ad-Hoc) Pattern\nFor one-off or dynamic code structures not defined in the config, you can pass the pattern directly.\nuse vsent\\Codegenerator\\Facades\\CodeGenerator;\n// Generate a custom short code for an event registration\ntry {\n$eventCode = CodeGenerator::generateFor('EVT-{DATE:md}-{RANDOM:4}', [\n'type' => 'EVENT', // Type used for placeholder and sequence tracking if applicable\n'code_length' => 12 // Ensure total length is 12\n]);\n// Example: EVT-0609-ABCD0000\n} catch (\\RuntimeException $e) {\necho \"Error generating event code: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\nConfirming Usage for Sequential Codes (Crucial!)\nFor any code generated using the {SEQUENCE} placeholder, it's CRUCIAL to call confirmUsage() once the code has been successfully processed and committed in your application (e.g., after saving an order to the database). This updates the sequence in the code_sequences table, ensuring proper sequential numbering and preventing gaps in your confirmed sequences if a generated code isn't actually used.\nuse vsent\\Codegenerator\\Facades\\CodeGenerator;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\DB; // Example of wrapping in a transaction\ntry {\nDB::beginTransaction();\n$orderCode = CodeGenerator::generateFor('order');\n// ... logic to save the order to your 'orders' table using $orderCode ...\nif (CodeGenerator::confirmUsage($orderCode)) {\n  DB::commit();\n  echo \"Order created and code confirmed: \" . $orderCode;\n} else {\n  DB::rollBack();\n  echo \"Failed to confirm order code usage. Transaction rolled back.\";\n}\n} catch (\\RuntimeException $e) {\nDB::rollBack();\necho \"Error during order creation: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n// Note: For codes generated with {UUID} or {RANDOM}, confirmUsage() is generally not needed,\n// as their uniqueness is inherent and not managed by a shared sequence counter.\nContributing\nFeel free to open issues or pull requests on the GitHub repository.\nLicense\nThis package is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license.", "ped_digest": "P:Composer v1 support is ending|Robust, flexible, pattern-based code generator for Laravel|Thread-safe sequence management|Configurable patterns|Supports unique components (sequential, random, UUIDs);E:Installation via composer|Publish configuration and migrations|Run migrations|Generate codes using CodeGenerator Facade|Confirm usage of sequential codes;D:1 install|0 dependents|0 suggesters|0 security|0 stars|0 watchers|0 forks|0 open issues|php: ^8.2 required|illuminate/contracts: ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0 required|illuminate/database: ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0 required|illuminate/support: ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0 required;", "er_digest": null, "gist": "P:Composer v1 support is ending|Robust, flexible, pattern-based code generator for Laravel|Thread-safe sequence management|Configurable patterns|Supports unique components (sequential, random, UUIDs);E:Installation via composer|Publish configuration and migrations|Run migrations|Generate codes using CodeGenerator Facade|Confirm usage of sequential codes;D:1 install|0 dependents|0 suggesters|0 security|0 stars|0 watchers|0 forks|0 open issues|php: ^8.2 required|illuminate/contracts: ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0 required|illuminate/database: ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0 required|illuminate/support: ^10.0|^11.0|^12.0 required;", "entities": null, "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://github.com/apple/swift-binary-parsing", "content": "Skip to content\nNavigation Menu\nSign in\nAppearance settings\napple\nSearch code, repositories, users, issues, pull requests...\nSearch syntax tips\nProvide feedback\nSaved searches\nUse saved searches to filter your results more quickly\nSign in\nSign up\nAppearance settings\nYou signed in with another tab or window.\nReload\nto refresh your session.\nYou signed out in another tab or window.\nReload\nto refresh your session.\nYou switched accounts on another tab or window.\nReload\nto refresh your session.\nDismiss alert\nApple\nVerified\nWe've verified that the organization\napple\ncontrols the domain:\napple.com\nLearn more about verified organizations\n28.8k\nfollowers\nCupertino, CA\nhttps://apple.com\nPinned\nLoading\nml-stable-diffusion\nml-stable-diffusion\nPublic\nStable Diffusion with Core ML on Apple Silicon\nPython\n17.4k\n1k\nfoundationdb\nfoundationdb\nPublic\nFoundationDB - the open source, distributed, transactional key-value store\nC++\n15.3k\n1.4k\npkl\npkl\nPublic\nA configuration as code language with rich validation and tooling.\nJava\n10.7k\n314\ncoremltools\ncoremltools\nPublic\nCore ML tools contain supporting tools for Core ML model conversion, editing, and validation.\nPython\n4.8k\n696\npassword-manager-resources\npassword-manager-resources\nPublic\nA place for creators and users of password managers to collaborate on resources to make password management better.\nJavaScript\n4.4k\n493\ncontainer\ncontainer\nPublic\nA tool for creating and running Linux containers using lightweight virtual machines on a Mac.

This discovery, developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, could be the solution to one of the most pressing global challenges: hunger. The new rice promises not only to increase agricultural yields but also to transform vast, previously unusable land into productive, arable space.\nBoosting Yields by Regulating Plant Hormones\nThis innovative project, which might be best described as a post-Green Revolution genetic breakthrough, focuses on the manipulation of a plant hormone called gibberellin.\nGibberellin\nplays a key role in plant growth, and by regulating it, the researchers have developed a rice strain that can withstand environmental stressors, such as soil salinity. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), around 1.4 billion hectares of land\u2014over 10% of the world\u2019s total arable land\u2014are affected by salinity. This breakthrough offers the promise of vastly increasing the amount of usable farmland.\nA Solution for Alkaline Soils and High Temperatures\nIn addition to making rice more resilient to salt, the researchers have identified two genes, ATT1 and ATT2, that give rice plants resistance to alkalinity and heat. By tweaking the synthesis of gibberellin, they discovered that the\nATT2 gene\nwas particularly effective in regulating the hormone to optimal levels, enabling the plant to thrive under stress while increasing its yield. This precision could be key to maximizing food production, even as climate change makes growing conditions increasingly unpredictable.\nSee also\nMark Zuckerberg hints at the end for Meta\u2019s programmers, with more companies expected to follow suit by 2025\nImpressive Results Under Alkaline Conditions\nThe results of testing under alkaline conditions have been astounding. By enhancing the expression of the ATT2 gene, rice yields increased by an impressive 78 to 101% per plot compared to standard crops. These findings are a powerful indicator of how this innovation could play a pivotal role in securing global food safety as the world faces rapid population growth, diminishing agricultural land, and the escalating effects of climate change.\nTurning Marginal Land Into Productive Farmland\nThe research team is now focusing on the potential of marginal lands\u2014areas that have previously been too inhospitable for agriculture due to harsh conditions such as high salt or alkalinity. By applying the ATT2 gene technology, these lands could be transformed into productive agricultural zones, helping to ease the pressure on traditional farming methods that often deplete the soil. This approach also presents an opportunity to reduce reliance on intensive agricultural practices that are harming the environment.\nEnhancing Stress Tolerance and Boosting Production\nIn addition to genetic adjustments, the team has demonstrated that adding gibberellic acid\u2014a naturally occurring plant hormone\u2014can further enhance stress tolerance in rice, making it more resilient to environmental challenges. This could help maintain high yields even in difficult conditions, offering a safeguard against unpredictable weather patterns and other agricultural challenges.\nThe Global Impact of Rice Farming\nRice, a crop cultivated for over 7,000 years, remains a staple for nearly half of the world\u2019s population. It is particularly important in\nAsia\n, which accounts for around 90% of global production. As of 2021, global rice production reached 787.3 million tons, with\nChina and\nIndia\ntogether contributing more than half of this total. While rice farming is mostly dependent on irrigation systems, this new variety, with its resilience to salt, heat, and poor soils, could revolutionize farming in areas that are currently unproductive.\nSubscribe to the Glass Almanac YouTube channel\nSee also\nGoogle Accidentally Leaks Details of Its Revolutionary AI Assistant, Jarvis\nA New Era in Agriculture\nThis technological breakthrough is more than just a scientific achievement; it\u2019s a potential game-changer for global food security. As the world continues to face challenges related to climate change, land degradation, and food shortages, innovations like this one provide hope for a more sustainable and productive future. The development of rice that can thrive on previously barren lands offers a new path forward, one that could change the lives of millions and help eradicate hunger across the globe.\nWith this exciting discovery, China is positioning itself as a leader in\nsustainable agriculture\n, and the world is watching closely to see how this technology will reshape the future of food production.\nSimilar Posts\nTurkey\u2019s land is sinking \u2013 how industrial farming is fuelling the collapse\n1,700 sheep walked through solar panels : scientists publish surprising results\nElon Musk just laid off 6,000 people, now the US faces a surprising invasion\nCan We Soon Grow Food Directly in Space?

Gavin Newsom called the move reckless and \u201cdisrespectful to our troops\u201d in a post on the social platform X.\nBy JASON DEAREN and TIM SULLIVAN, Associated Press\nupdated on June 9, 2025\n5 minutes to read\nEmail\nEmail\n...\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014\nPresident Donald Trump\nauthorized on Monday the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard members to help respond to protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids, according to U.S. officials.\nThe order would put them on active duty. One official warned, however, that the order was just signed and it could take a day or two to get troops moving.\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.\nGov. Gavin Newsom called the move reckless and \u201cdisrespectful to our troops\u201d in a post on the social platform X.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about public safety. It\u2019s about stroking a dangerous President\u2019s ego,\u201d Newsom said.\nAdvertisement:\nThe Pentagon also deployed about 700 Marines to Los Angeles on Monday to help National Guard members respond to protests over immigration raids, officials said, as California sued Trump over\u00a0his use\u00a0of the Guard troops and demonstrators took to the city\u2019s streets for a fourth day.\nThe Marines are being deployed from their base at Twentynine Palms in the Southern California desert to\u00a0protect federal property\u00a0and personnel, including federal immigration agents, U.S. Northern Command said in a statement.\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement Monday afternoon he was confident in the police department\u2019s ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines\u2019 arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a \u201csignificant logistical and operational challenge\u201d for them.\nAdvertisement:\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops by telling reporters that Trump had \u201ctrampled\u201d the state\u2019s sovereignty.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops,\u201d Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump\u2019s use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.\nThe\u00a0arrival of the National Guard\u00a0followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people that day across the city.\nThe smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.\nThe law enforcement presence was heavy, with police cars from neighboring cities blocking the street in front of the federal detention facility that was a focus of the protests.\nThe clashes unfolded over just a few square blocks in an immense city of some 4 million people, most of whom went about their normal business on peaceful streets.\nEarly protests remained peaceful\nOn Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader\u00a0David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta\u2019s arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration\u2019s crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state\u2019s janitors, security officers and other workers.\nAdvertisement:\nEarly protests Monday had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta\u2019s release.\nProtesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention center where Huerta was being held, and at times sang in front of a line of police officers, who unsuccessfully asked people to move off the road and onto the sidewalk. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organizers at times to deescalate moments of tension.\nChanting against a line of National Guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, \u201cFree them all!\u201d and \u201cNational Guard go away.\u201d\nBonta accused Trump of fanning protesters\u2019 anger with his announcement of the deployment, saying he set off Sunday\u2019s clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cThis was not inevitable,\u201d he said.\nTrump said Monday that the city would have been \u201ccompletely obliterated\u201d if he had not deployed the Guard.\nLater, at a White House event, he added that state leaders \u201cwere afraid to do anything.\u201d\nOther protests were taking shape Monday afternoon across LA County, as confirmed reports of federal immigration agents in the cities of Whittier and Huntington Park south of Los Angeles spurred anger from activists. More protests were scheduled for cities across the country.\nAdvertisement:\nOutside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.\nThe family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him.\n\u201cJacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,\u201d Vasquez\u2019s brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.\nOn Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects ranging from rocks to electric scooters at police and their vehicles.\nMcDonnell said police officers were \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the remaining protesters. who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. McDonnell said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days.\nSeveral dozen people were arrested throughout the weekend. One was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.\nGovernor says Guard not needed\nNewsom urged Trump to rescind the Guard deployment in a\u00a0letter\u00a0Sunday, calling it a \u201cserious breach of state sovereignty.\u201d\nThe governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump\u2019s plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction.\nAdvertisement:\n\u201cTrump wants chaos and he\u2019s instigated violence,\u201d he said. \u201cStay peaceful. Stay focused. Don\u2019t give him the excuse he\u2019s looking for.\u201d\nThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state\u2019s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the\u00a0administration\u2019s mass deportation\u00a0efforts.\nNewsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said California authorities had the situation under control.\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor\u2019s permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is \u201ca rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d\nSullivan reported from Minneapolis.

Morrison\n0\nMon Jun 9, 2025 - 1:00 pm EDT\nMon Jun 9, 2025 - 1:06 pm EDT\n(\nLifeSiteNews\n) \u2014 One of the first questions and answers in the 1861 edition of Fr. F. X. Weninger\u2019s\nA Manual of the Catholic Religion for Catechists, Teachers, and Self-Instruction\nrelates to our duties as Christians:\nQ. To what does the name of\nChristian\noblige us? A. It obliges us to render thanks to God for the inestimable favor of being called to the true faith. It obliges us to know all that the law of Christ commands us to believe and to do. It obliges us, moreover, to lead a life corresponding to this name; for if any one should pride in the name of Christian, and, nevertheless, live the life of a heathen, such a one would only bear that name for his greater responsibility and condemnation. And finally, it obliges us to suffer every thing, and to be ready to lay down even our lives for Christ, and for the truth of our holy faith, just as Christ suffered and laid down His life for us. (pp. 9-10)\nFr. Weninger wrote of our \u201cbeing called to the true faith\u201d to signify that all Christians are called to practice the Catholic Faith, which is the only religion given\nto us by God by which we can please Him and save our souls. Elsewhere in his\nManual of the Catholic Religion\n, Fr. Weninger describes the limited circumstances in which those who are truly ignorant of the Catholic Faith can save their souls, but here he reminds us that God wants all souls who go by the name of Christian to belong to the Catholic Church and follow its teachings. One who would call himself Christian without living up to the obligations of the Faith \u201cwould only bear that name for his greater responsibility and condemnation.\u201d\nThose who understand and believe the words of Fr. Weninger have no doubts about whether they really need to adhere to what the Catholic Church has always taught. And, for this reason, such faithful Christians (Catholics) will stand in the way of those who seek to spread evil throughout society. Because Catholics must \u201cbe ready to lay down even our lives for Christ, and for the truth of our holy faith,\u201d we will not easily succumb to pressures from secular powers who threaten us with temporal punishments for our refusal to subject ourselves to eternal condemnation.\nAs such, we know that the enemies of God and His Church would want to do all in their power to turn Catholics away from this true understanding of their obligations. In his 1832 encyclical on liberalism and indifferentism,\nMirari Vos\n, Pope Gregory XVI warned of a primary means by which the Church\u2019s enemies seek to deceive Catholics:\nNow We consider another abundant source of the evils with which the Church is afflicted at present: indifferentism. This perverse opinion is spread on all sides by the fraud of the wicked who claim that it is possible to obtain the eternal salvation of the soul by the profession of any kind of religion, as long as morality is maintained. Surely, in so clear a matter, you will drive this deadly error far from the people committed to your care. With the admonition of the apostle that \u2018there is one God, one faith, one baptism\u2019 may those fear who contrive the notion that the safe harbor of salvation is open to persons of any religion whatever. \u2026 Therefore \u2018without a doubt, they will perish forever, unless they hold the Catholic faith whole and inviolate.\u2019 Let them hear Jerome who, while the Church was torn into three parts by schism, tells us that whenever someone tried to persuade him to join his group he always exclaimed: \u2018He who is for the See of Peter is for me.\u2019 A schismatic flatters himself falsely if he asserts that he, too, has been washed in the waters of regeneration. Indeed Augustine would reply to such a man: \u2018The branch has the same form when it has been cut off from the vine; but of what profit for it is the form, if it does not live from the root?\u2019 This shameful font of indifferentism gives rise to that absurd and erroneous proposition which claims that liberty of conscience must be maintained for everyone.\nREAD:\nHere are some neat ways Catholics can honor the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the month of June\nGregory XVI referred to indifferentism as a \u201cdeadly error\u201d because it misleads souls into thinking that they can save their souls without living up to the obligations described so well by Fr. Weninger. Those who think they can be saved by following a religion other than the one established by Our Lord \u2014 Catholicism \u2014 may do an exemplary job of living up to the obligations of their non-Catholic religion, but they often will scorn the obligations of the religion actually established by Christ. It is for this reason that Gregory XVI reminded Catholics of the eternal consequences of indifferentism by quoting the words of the\nAthanasian Creed\n: \u201cWithout a doubt, they will perish forever, unless they hold the Catholic faith whole and inviolate.\u201d\nHow many bishops today agree with these words from Gregory XVI\u2019s\nMirari Vos\n? How many faithful outside of Traditional Latin Mass congregations have heard such things from their clergy? How many Catholics today truly live up to their obligations as Christians? How many Catholics today are willing to resist all of the temptations of the modern world to remain truly Christian, no matter what the cost?\nIt seems that the simplest answer to these questions is that the indifferentism condemned by Gregory XVI has essentially become the most prevalent approach to Catholicism among an overwhelming percentage of clergy in the Church. All of the evils afflicting the Church today relate, in one way or another, to the erroneous belief that Christians do not really need to follow what the Church has always taught to please God and save their souls.\nHow John Paul II characterized the situation over 20 years ago\nLest we imagine that indifferentism was relatively unknown among Catholics until the evils propagated by Francis, it is worth recalling words from John Paul II\u2019s 2003 Apostolic Exhortation,\nEcclesia in Europa\n:\nThis message is also addressed today to the Churches in Europe, often tempted by a dimming of hope. \u2026 Among the aspects of this situation, so many of which were frequently mentioned during the Synod, I would like to mention in a particular way the loss of Europe\u2019s Christian memory and heritage, accompanied by a kind of practical agnosticism and religious indifference whereby many Europeans give the impression of living without spiritual roots and somewhat like heirs who have squandered a patrimony entrusted to them by history. It is no real surprise, then, that there are efforts to create a vision of Europe which ignore its religious heritage, and in particular, its profound Christian soul, asserting the rights of the peoples who make up Europe without grafting those rights on to the trunk which is enlivened by the sap of Christianity.\nThe contagion of indifferentism had spread throughout Europe already in 2003, such that John Paul II observed \u201ca kind of practical agnosticism and religious indifference whereby many Europeans give the impression of living without spiritual roots.\u201d From this practical agnosticism and religious indifference flowed various putrid fruits, including hopelessness, silent apostasy, and the culture of death:\nAt the root of this loss of hope is an attempt to promote a vision of man apart from God and apart from Christ. This sort of thinking has led to man being considered as \u2018the absolute centre of reality, a view which makes him occupy \u2013 falsely \u2013 the place of God and which forgets that it is not man who creates God, but rather God who creates man. Forgetfulness of God led to the abandonment of man.\u2019 \u2026 European culture gives the impression of \u2018\nsilent apostasy\n\u2019 on the part of people who have all that they need and who live as if God does not exist. \u2026 This culture is also marked by a widespread and growing religious agnosticism, connected to a more profound moral and legal relativism rooted in confusion regarding the truth about man as the basis of the inalienable rights of all human beings. At times the signs of a weakening of hope are evident in disturbing forms of what might be called a \u2018culture of death.\u2019\nJohn Paul II named many symptoms of this silent apostasy and culture of death, including \u201cthe diminishing number of births, the decline in the number of vocations to the priesthood and religious life, and the difficulty, if not the outright refusal, to make lifelong commitments, including marriage.\u201d In our own time, we see that this culture of death extends to nominally Catholic politicians promoting abortion, contraception, and euthanasia, with nominal Catholics among the largest population of voters putting them into office.\nThe \u2018Council of the media\u2019 as seen by Benedict XVI\nTen years after John Paul II\u2019s\nEcclesia in Europa\n, Benedict XVI spoke of similar disasters afflicting the Church. In his February 14, 2013, farewell\naddress\nto the clergy of Rome, he placed the blame on what he termed the \u201cCouncil of the media\u201d:\nWe know that this Council of the media was accessible to everyone. Therefore, this was the dominant one, the more effective one, and it created so many disasters, so many problems, so much suffering: seminaries closed, convents closed, banal liturgy \u2026 and the real Council had difficulty establishing itself and taking shape; the virtual Council was stronger than the real Council.\nThus, according to Benedict XVI, the media in some way distorted the meaning of the real Council to cause so many disasters and so much suffering. If we are serious about addressing the evils in the Church, it seems that we must follow Benedict XVI\u2019s lead in attempting to counteract this evil \u201cCouncil of the media.\u201d\nBecause both Gregory XVI and John Paul II referred to the disasters caused by indifferentism, we should consider whether the Council of the media might have contributed in some way to a proliferation of that plague. Recalling that Gregory XVI described indifferentism as the \u201cclaim that it is possible to obtain the eternal salvation of the soul by the profession of any kind of religion,\u201d is there any way in which the Council of the media fostered such a wicked belief?\nAlthough, properly speaking, it is not \u201cthe media,\u201d the Lutheran-Roman Catholic Commission on Unity (co-chaired by the heretical Cardinal Walter Kasper and a Lutheran bishop) published a 2006 study on the \u201capostolicity of the church\u201d which assuredly showcases the interpretations of the Council that give rise to the indifferentism condemned by Gregory XVI. Here, for instance, the study cites Vatican II\u2019s Decree on Ecumenism,\nUnitatis Redintegratio\n, to support the assertion that Catholicism and Lutheranism have common share of Christ\u2019s salvation:\nVatican II\u2019s Decree on Ecumenism (\nUnitatis redintegratio\n) laid a central foundation of our dialogue by acknowledging that the other churches and ecclesial communities \u2018have been by no means deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation. For the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation\u2026\u2019 (\nUR\n3). The same passage mentions again \u2018the elements of sanctification and truth,\u2019 with amplification on liturgical worship among the endowments which come from Christ and constitute the separated communities as means by which the Spirit of Christ works out the salvation of their members. From this conciliar affirmation of the Christian endowments of the separated churches, Catholic ecumenical theology is justified in concluding to an implicit recognition of these churches and ecclesial communities as apostolic, since the very elements listed are not meteorites fallen from heaven into the churches of our time, but have come from Christ through the ministry of his apostles and are components of the apostolic tradition.\nBeyond our common sharing in Christ\u2019s salvation by grace and personal faith, we are also in real, but still imperfect, ecclesial communion (\nUR\n3)\nbecause we share the mediating elements of sanctification and truth given by God through Christ and the apostles. [Emphasis added.]\nREAD:\nIt has been nearly 100 years since Our Lady asked Catholics to honor the First Saturday of every month\nThis statement unambiguously promotes the religious indifferentism condemned by Gregory XVI in his\nMirari Vos\n. Is its reliance on Vatican II\u2019s\nUnitatis Redintegratio\nillegitimate? How, in other words, should we accurately read the following passage from Vatican II\u2019s Decree on Ecumenism to avoid the conclusion reached by the Lutheran-Roman Catholic Commission on Unity?\nThe brethren divided from us also use many liturgical actions of the Christian religion. These most certainly can truly engender a life of grace in ways that vary according to the condition of each Church or Community. These liturgical actions must be regarded as capable of giving access to the community of salvation. It follows that the separated Churches and Communities as such, though we believe them to be deficient in some respects, have been by no means deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation. For the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation which derive their efficacy from the very fullness of grace and truth entrusted to the Church.\nDoes the statement that the Spirit of Christ uses non-Catholic religions as a means of salvation seem limited to the case of Baptism, which is efficacious even when properly administered by non-Catholics? No, the reference to liturgical actions that \u201cengender a life of grace\u201d obviously extends well beyond Baptism. Thus, there does not appear to be a reasonable interpretation of this key passage from Vatican II other than the one made by the Lutheran-Roman Catholic Commission on Unity.\nBut if Lutherans and Catholics are each on the path of salvation by following their respective religions, what can we say about the \u201cculture of death\u201d so detested by true Catholics? What do Lutherans believe on the relevant issues? Here are positions on three key issues from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America:\nAbortion\n:\n\u201cAbortion ought to be an option only of last resort. Therefore, as a church we seek to reduce the need to turn to abortion as the answer to unintended pregnancies.\u201d\nContraception\n:\n\u201cThis church teaches that abortion and reproductive health care, including contraception, must be legal and accessible.\u201d\nSame-Sex \u201cMarriage\u201d\n:\n\u201cThe Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs (LOGA), Washington D.C., the federal public policy office of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), joined 25 other religious organizations June 3 to urge members of the U.S. Congress to reject the proposed \u2018Federal Marriage Amendment.\u2019 The religious organizations said the proposal threatens individual civil rights and religious freedom. The amendment, proposed in February by President George W. Bush, states that \u2018Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.\u201d\nIf Lutherans and all other Protestants are saved by following their non-Catholic religions (as we read above), how can Catholics be damned for adopting the authorized Protestant positions on these issues? And how can Catholics credibly demand that non-Catholic politicians oppose the Lutheran (or other Protestant) positions when high percentages of Catholics have also adopted them? The culture of religious indifference among Catholics has become one of the greatest contributors to the culture of death throughout the world. As such, a vital step in helping restore a culture of life is to restore the Catholic belief on the need for all Christians to live up to the true obligations of the Catholic Faith. Until that happens, the message that we must protect life will be continually undermined by the message that there is no real need to practice the Catholic Faith to please God and save our souls.\nImmaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us!\nYour support makes stories like this possible!\nLifeSiteNews is completely donor supported, allowing us to report on what truly is happening in the world, free of charge and uncensored.

Or hearing of their plight, do you feel like giving them a shake?\nIn a slight variation on the annual moan-fest that is the Police Federation conference, senior representatives of the service have\npenned a joint article\nlisting their many woes. With dismal absence of originality, they complain of \u201ccrushed\u201d morale and thinning blue lines, as underpaid, overworked officers jack it all for early retirement to the Costas. As\nthe Spending Review looms\n, behold the usual desperate attempt to guilt trip ministers into ponying up more cash.\nThose of us who grew up with kindly constables coming to school to talk about \u201cstranger danger\u201d and the Green Cross Code yearn for the heroes of our youth. They were the human barrier between good and evil, fighting the good fight against robbers and child snatchers. How we used to look up to them and take comfort from their solid, reassuring presence on our streets. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to experience such pure, uncomplicated feelings of admiration about the police today?\nThe trouble is they just keep letting us down, behaving in ways that are spineless and foolish, and going after all the wrong people in all wrong ways. Modern training appears to prohibit any exercise of discretion or common sense, in favour of moronic tick box responses and\nrainbow coloured cars\n.\nI am reminded of this every Friday morning, when swarms of officers descend on the Embankment in central London in search of the odd trucker who might not have the right paperwork. With the luxury of crime free streets and unlimited resources this dreary weekly exercise might be worthwhile, but as dope heads, muggers and petty thieves do their worst all around, it is a very curious priority.\nOf course there are still good guys who are horrified by the systematic misallocation of resources. They cringe at the pursuit of totally inconsequential \u201chate crimes\u201d and even more ridiculous \u201cnon hate crime incidents\u201d. Still valiantly trying to catch real criminals, they were appalled by the diminishment of their roles during the pandemic, when they were forced to police petty lockdown breaches. Old pros have no difficulty understanding that flimsy complaints about unpleasant Tweets rarely require a siren-wailing response, and that having black or brown skin should never provide an exemption from the law.\nTragically, these stalwarts can no longer rely on either the support or sound judgement of their bosses, who have a nasty habit of punishing bravery and initiative. Just\nask poor Stg Martyn Blake\n, who put his life on the line in pursuit of a man with previous convictions and gangland associations \u2013 and found himself charged with murder. Having been cleared by the courts, he now faces an investigation for \u201cgross misconduct.\u201d Then\nthere\u2019s PC Lorne Castle\n, sacked by Dorset Police for failing to treat a knife-wielding teenager with sufficient \u201crespect.\u201d The way these decent officers and others are make split second decisions in life threatening situations are treated beggars belief.\nThen again, some plods deserve everything they get. Witness the grotesque cowardice of the\nofficers who allegedly tasered\na confused one-legged nonagenarian after he refused orders to put down a butter knife. In that single inexplicable act, these cruel clowns brought their entire profession into disrepute.\nRemember all this, as they beg the Government for bigger budgets.

The ruling orders the Labor Department to appear at a court hearing on June 17. -Ed._\nRIVERTON\u2014What began as a trickle soon turned into a flood of people streaming out of the Wind River Job Corps. More than 100 students and staff walked off the campus Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness of their plight: that Wyoming's only Job Corps center will soon be shuttered by federal decree. \nThe students were predominantly young men, and most had dropped out of high school. Some had made mistakes, finding themselves in trouble with the law. Others had gotten mixed up with drugs, lived on the streets and served prison time. Some, feeling aimless, just wanted to find purpose. \nAll had found promise here at Wind River Job Corps, a trade school that offers paths to high school diplomas, driver\u2019s licenses and certifications in fields like welding and truck driving. \nIgor Bool grew up in Ukraine and was adopted by a Gillette family when he was 13. As a teenager, he said, he made bad choices. Bool, now 17, came to Wind River Job Corps \u201cto start a life and start making better choices \u2026 and find a career that could potentially lead me to a life of success.\u201d\nThe center, which employs roughly 150 people and currently serves 178 students, was thrown into chaos when the U.S. Department of Labor announced last week [it would pause operations](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osec/osec20250529) at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide. The decision aligns with President Donald Trump\u2019s budget proposal and \u201creflects the Administration\u2019s commitment to ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,\u201d the announcement read. \nFor Wyoming\u2019s only Job Corps center the news has disrupted career tracks and left employees and students reeling. Staff have spent the past week scrambling to prepare for an abrupt closure date of June 23, and fear the loss will leave many students to fend for themselves with zero resources. \n\u201cOur kids are just devastated,\u201d said Wind River Job Corps administrator Jerri Prejean. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad.\u201d\nWind River Job Corps student Igor Bool, 17, is from Ukraine but was adopted by a Gillette family when he was 13. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile)\nBool just arrived at the center in April. He is nearly finished with the online high school program to earn his diploma but won\u2019t be able to start his training in petroleum. Though disappointed by the news, Bool showed resilience beyond his years. \n\u201cI was kind of disappointed because I have no place to go, so I thought they were just gonna put me back on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is what it is. I can only control myself and my choices and what I'm gonna do, I cannot control the situation because it's out of my hands. So I just gotta stay positive.\u201d\nNot everyone was as upbeat. \nJamie Maloid, 25, is one of the lucky ones. Having arrived at Job Corps in 2023, he just graduated after finishing his certifications in the petroleum program. He plans to move to Greeley and start a career. \n\u201cFor the other people that aren\u2019t finished, I feel bad,\u201d Maloid said. \u201cI kind of feel like just taking that opportunity away from them that I was able to gain is heartbreaking.\u201d\n#### **Incidents, budget**\nJob Corps is a 61-year-old federal program that offers free career training for low-income young adults. Funded by Congress, the program seeks to teach young people the academic and vocational skills they need to secure meaningful and lasting employment. The program was created in 1964 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty.\nWind River Job Corps is a comparatively new center. The campus opened in 2015, north of Riverton, to much fanfare with dignitaries attending the grand opening and touting [the economic boost promised by its first-of-its-kind petroleum technician training program.](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20151005)\nIt includes classrooms, hands-on training facilities and dorms. Students come from around the country to attend the program, including from Wyoming and the nearby Wind River Indian Reservation. Through the program, they can obtain their driver\u2019s licence, high school diploma and career preparation in one of 10 trades \u2014 from carpentry to electrical work and heavy equipment mechanics.\nThe Wind River Job Corps campus in Riverton officially opened in October 2015. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile)\nOnce they get their certifications, Prejean said, staff ushers them through a transition phase to ensure the student has job placement, an apprenticeship, college, military or advanced training. Wind River Job Corps even pays to fly the students to where their next life stage will take place. \n\u201cI try to do job placement with students around our community,\u201d Prejean said, noting that she works with local companies like Bechtel Construction to funnel skilled workers into Wyoming positions. \nSome 75% of Wind River Job Corps students graduate, she said. \u201cOf those, 85% go to a job trade match. You don't even have those kinds of numbers from college.\u201d\nThe success of Riverton\u2019s center does not match a national narrative cited in the closure decree, Prejean said.\nIn April, the Department of Labor released the Job Corps Transparency Report, which analyzed the financial performance and operational costs of the most recently available metrics from program year 2023. According to that report, the national program\u2019s average graduation rate is less than 40%, and it costs $80,000 per student per year. Job Corps also has faced significant financial challenges under its current operating structure, the DOL release said, including a $140 million deficit in 2024.   \nThose findings spurred the DOL to pause the program. It halted contracts to its 99 contract-operated centers, which will impact an estimated 25,000 students. \n\u201cA startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve,\u201d Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a release about the pause. \nWind River Job Corps student Junior Chapa, 21, bows his head to show off his hard hat, which fellow students signed as a goodbye gesture in light of an expected shutdown at the Riverton center. The Department of Labor announced on May 29, 2025 that it\u2019s pausing operations at the country\u2019s Job Corps centers. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile)\nThe narrative painted in that report \u2014 which used data from the end of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 is incongruous with Wind River Job Corps, Prejean said. It has clear benefits to students, local businesses that need skilled workers and the 150 employees who are residents of Fremont County, she said. \nDue to DOL\u2019s mandate, Wind River staff are anticipating a closing day of June 23 unless some overriding action occurs. The outcome of the federal budget bill, officially called the \u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d could also impact the program. The bill passed the U.S. House last week and must still clear the Senate. \n\u201cAll students will be connected with the resources they need to succeed as this transition takes place,\u201d the DOL said in its release. \nAt Wind River, however, staff and students did not see it that way. \n#### **Uncertainty**\nIn the final weeks before the anticipated closing, staff are racing to secure job placements and obtain diplomas for the students. But for students and staff, the future beyond that is a question mark. \nJaden Flowers, 23, didn\u2019t finish high school in Los Angeles, where he grew up. He had a child at age 15 and his mom was sick, he said, so school wasn\u2019t a priority. He migrated to Colorado after that, and was unhoused and unable to find a job this spring when he discovered Job Corps. \nWind River Job Corps students Gabriel Boulder, Israel Avitia Wright, Junior Chapa and Sage Duran gather near the Riverton trade school on June 4, 2025, to raise awareness that the center may soon close due to a federal decree. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile)\nHe\u2019s only been in Riverton for two months and said it\u2019s been a great experience. He is trying to get as many petroleum certifications as possible before June 23, he said, so at least he\u2019ll have some leverage for finding a job. In terms of a plan, however, he hasn\u2019t figured that out. \n\u201cI don\u2019t really have nowhere to go, so it\u2019s just back to where I left off,\u201d he said. \nThat\u2019s a common story, he added. \n\u201cIt's a mess. It's crazy how they're just kicking us out, with nothing, no place to go,\u201d Flowers said. Wind River Job Corps teachers are doing everything they can to help, he added. \u201cThey are really trying.\u201d \nJoshuwa Begley, 25, is nearly finished with the program. He arrived two years ago, looking for a change from his life of meaningless jobs and substance abuse, he said. It worked. \n\u201cI changed my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a year sober from all the drugs I used to do.\u201d\nHe earned his high school diploma at Job Corps and just needs to pass a final test to complete his heavy truck driving program. \nWind River Job Corps students march off campus on June 4, 2025 to raise awareness of its impending closure. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile)\nBegley had intended to stay in the area and had found a job with a local construction business. But because he won\u2019t receive the completion money promised to him in the Job Corps contract and he doesn\u2019t have a place to live, he said, he is instead going back to Georgia where he\u2019ll move in with his grandmother. \n\u201cIt just kind of sucks,\u201d Begley said. \u201cAll my hard work is going down the drain.\u201d\nJunior Chapa, 21, was incarcerated for two years in prison in Texas.

This is urging the government to introduce wealth taxes to fund investment in public services, climate action, and as an alternative to cuts. It advocates for a range of changes to the tax system which would raise \u00a350bn for public investment.\nThis comes amid reports that the government\nis considering softening\ncuts to DWP PIP benefits after fierce backlash from Labour MPs. A vote is expected this month. So far, more than 100 Labour MPs\nhave signed\na letter opposing the cuts.\nMad Youth Organise is a campaign by Just Treatment led by people with lived experience of mental illness.

The super-rich have never had it so good. So instead of slashing life-saving support for the most vulnerable disabled people, it\u2019s past time for this government to make the super-rich pay up through wealth taxes that would raise billions for investment in schools, hospitals, climate action and making life affordable for ordinary people again \u2013 not more cuts.\nFeatured image and additional images supplied\nBy\nThe Canary", "ped_digest": "P:DWP PIP cuts are planned|Constituent challenged Darren Jones on PIP cuts|Wealth taxes are proposed as an alternative|Jodey Whiting's case highlighted|Labour MPs oppose the cuts|PIP is a lifeline for disabled people|Wealth tax could reverse benefit cutsE:Town hall event on Saturday 7 June|Constituent Gigi challenged Darren Jones|Campaign coordinated by Mad Youth Organise and Green New Deal Rising|Government considering softening cuts|Vote expected this month|Previous challenge to Liz Kendall in MayD:350,000 people could be driven into poverty|\u00a36.1bn could be raised from top 20 billionaires|\u00a350bn could be raised through tax reforms|\u00a335 million added to UK billionaires' fortunes daily|100+ Labour MPs signed a letter opposing cuts|2% wealth tax on assets over \u00a310mBristol North West|EnglandDarren Jones|DWP|PIP|Jodey Whiting|Mad Youth Organise|Green New Deal Rising|Just Treatment|Tax Justice UK|Patriotic Millionaires|Liz Kendall|Zak Coleman|The Canary;", "er_digest": "N:Zak Coleman|Gigi|Liz Kendall|Darren Jones;R:UK|England;", "gist": "P:DWP PIP cuts are planned|Constituent challenged Darren Jones on PIP cuts|Wealth taxes are proposed as an alternative|Jodey Whiting's case highlighted|Labour MPs oppose the cuts|PIP is a lifeline for disabled people|Wealth tax could reverse benefit cutsE:Town hall event on Saturday 7 June|Constituent Gigi challenged Darren Jones|Campaign coordinated by Mad Youth Organise and Green New Deal Rising|Government considering softening cuts|Vote expected this month|Previous challenge to Liz Kendall in MayD:350,000 people could be driven into poverty|\u00a36.1bn could be raised from top 20 billionaires|\u00a350bn could be raised through tax reforms|\u00a335 million added to UK billionaires' fortunes daily|100+ Labour MPs signed a letter opposing cuts|2% wealth tax on assets over \u00a310mBristol North West|EnglandDarren Jones|DWP|PIP|Jodey Whiting|Mad Youth Organise|Green New Deal Rising|Just Treatment|Tax Justice UK|Patriotic Millionaires|Liz Kendall|Zak Coleman|The Canary;N:Zak Coleman|Gigi|Liz Kendall|Darren Jones;R:UK|England;", "entities": ["Zak Coleman", "Gigi", "Liz Kendall", "Darren Jones"], "regions": ["UK", "England"]}, {"_id": "https://www.techpowerup.com/337877/team-cherry-confirms-late-2025-launch-of-hollow-knight-silksong", "content": "Team Cherry first introduced Hollow Knight: Silksong back in February 2019, as a mainline sequel to the\nfirst entry\n(2017) in the series.

One of our 23 pairs of chromosomes carries genes that determine the embryo\u2019s sex; males have two different sex chromosomes (XY) while females have two X chromosomes (XX). However, for six weeks, every mammalian embryo is in limbo\u2014neither male nor female, but somewhere in between while the body develops. Then, a switch flips. A gene called\nSry\n, nestled on the Y chromosome, turns on. Testes begin to form. Hormones follow. A genetic boy becomes a biological one.\nThat\u2019s what the textbooks say. But a new study published in\nNature\nturns this assumption on its head. Scientists at Osaka University in Japan have discovered that something as mundane as a mother\u2019s iron levels can override this process entirely\u2014turning genetically male mouse embryos into females.\n\u201cTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an environmental factor can influence sex determination in a mammal,\u201d lead author Makoto Tachibana, a developmental biologist, told\nEl Pais\n. \u201cThe most important implication of this finding is that environmental and metabolic conditions influence fundamental developmental decisions that until now were thought to be strictly determined by genetics.\u201d\nA Matter of Iron\nThe results stem from a simple question: what happens when developing embryos are starved of iron?\nIron is not just for blood. Inside developing gonads, it plays a crucial role in activating enzymes that remove chemical tags from DNA\u2014tags that otherwise keep key genes like\nSry\nsilent. One enzyme in particular, called KDM3A, needs ferrous iron (Fe\u00b2\u207a) to function. Without it,\nSry\nstays off. And if\nSry\ndoesn\u2019t speak, the embryo becomes female, regardless of its XY chromosome pair.\nTo test this, Tachibana\u2019s team tried three separate strategies. First, they knocked out an iron transport gene,\nTfrc\n, in gonadal cells of mouse embryos. Seven out of 39 genetically male mice developed ovaries instead of testes.\nThen, they gave pregnant mice an oral iron chelator\u2014a compound that binds iron and makes it unavailable. This chemical mimic of iron deficiency caused three out of 72 XY embryos to develop ovotestes, mixed-sex organs containing both ovarian and testicular tissue.\nRelated\nPosts\nIn the Earth\u2019s core, it\u2019s snowing iron\nSolar fuels just years away, propelled by breakthrough in catalyst research\nThe moon is getting rusty due to oxygen stripped from Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nChromosomes turn out to be half genes, half mysterious coating\nFinally, the team fed mice a long-term low-iron diet. That alone didn\u2019t trigger a sex change\u2014until they combined it with a mutation in\nKdm3a\n. Then, some XY embryos again reversed sex.\nAcross all experiments, the mechanism was the same: reduced iron blocked the removal of methyl groups\u2014epigenetic tags\u2014that silence\nSry\n. The gene never activated and the embryos became females.\n\u201cThis study provides clear evidence that variations in metabolism in the controlled uterine environment interface with the genetic sex-determination cascade and affect testis development,\u201d wrote Shannon Dupont and Blanche Capel, developmental biologists at Duke University, in a commentary also published in\nNature\n.\nAn Environmental Lever in a Genetic Lock\nThe findings are provocative because mammals have long been considered immune to environmental influences on sex. In reptiles and fish, the story is different. Temperature, social rank, or even parasites can nudge embryos toward one sex or another. Mammals, though, were thought to be locked into their genetic fate. Until now.\n\u201cDiscovering that something as mundane as iron concentration can cause a mammalian embryo to develop as a female is spectacular,\u201d said Francisco Javier Barrionuevo, a geneticist at the University of Granada, who was not involved in the study. He speculated that such sex reversals in humans could have gone unnoticed in the past\u2014especially in cases of extreme malnutrition.\nFor now, no such human cases have been identified. \u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t know if a similar process could occur in humans,\u201d Tachibana admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important question that deserves to be investigated.\u201d\nIron deficiency is not rare. It is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, especially in pregnant women. Mild cases are typically corrected with diet or supplements. Severe iron deficiency, however, is a known risk factor for miscarriage and impaired fetal development.\nThis study raises a new possibility: could iron levels during pregnancy subtly alter not just sex determination, but other features of development typically seen as hardwired?\n\u201cIt opens up the possibility that the mother\u2019s diet could affect not only the formation of testes but also other traits of \u2018masculinity,\u2019\u201d Dupont and Capel wrote.\nRewriting the Script of Sex\nNearly 40 years ago, the discovery of the\nSry\ngene revolutionized biology\u2019s understanding of sex. The gene was seen as the master key, unlocking a cascade of male development. It was elegant in its simplicity\u2014and, scientists thought, untouchable by external noise.\nBut now, that view is being challenged by what appears to be one of biology\u2019s softest touches: a micronutrient.\nThe genetically male mice with ovaries appeared otherwise healthy up to eight weeks of age, but researchers have not yet tested whether they can reproduce.\nStill, this research lays a new foundation. It suggests a broader principle: that even the most fundamental biological decisions\u2014like whether to become male or female\u2014are not wholly encoded in the genome. They can be tuned, or even rewritten, by the environment in which development unfolds.\nTags:\nChromosomes\niron\niron deficiency\nTudor Tarita\nAerospace engineer with a passion for biology, paleontology, and physics.\nRelated\nPosts\nAnimals\nChinese researchers create the first successful, living mammals with a fully-reconfigured genome\nby\nAlexandru Micu\n3 years ago\nArchaeology\nHuge stash of abused Iron Age weapons discovered in a German hill fort\nby\nAlexandru Micu\n4 years ago\nGenetics\nForget your biology book \u2014 here\u2019s what chromosomes really look like\nby\nMihai Andrei\n4 years ago\nChemistry\nA brewery in the Netherlands becomes the first iron-fueled factory in the world\nby\nAlexandru Micu\n5 years ago\nRecent news\nMuscle bros love their cold plunges.

Johnson\ndismissed\nthe case and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals\nkicked it back down\nto the lower court, the plaintiffs\nleft the case unresolved\nfor more than nine months. A\ndeadline was set\nfor Monday, leaving the plaintiffs with two choices: file an amended complaint or the district court\u2019s ruling would be final.\nChoosing the former, the plaintiffs highlight recent actions by the Trump administration in the\namended complaint\n. They also omit earlier allegations that Johnson described as \u201cunbefitting in federal court.\u201d\nJohnson also\nwarned plaintiffs\nahead of Monday\u2019s filing that including \u201cirrelevant stigmatizing allegations\u201d would result in the case being tossed.\nThe amended complaint features a revised set of parties.

Those filings characterized the litigation \u201csimply as a vehicle through which to publicize allegations\u201d about Langford.\n\u201cNow that the gravy train has run its course, the plaintiffs have apparently decided to move forward with the legal aspects of their claims, which have always been dubious,\u201d Berkness wrote in her statement. \u201cMs. Langford, however, has graduated and is moving forward.\u201d\nMonday\u2019s filing marks the second amended complaint in the case. The lawsuit, which was\ninitially filed anonymously\n, was first revised in April 2023 after a court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to seek legal action without their names attached.\nTrump administration actions\nA week ago, the Trump administration announced UW is under investigation for alleged Title IX violations stemming from Kappa Kappa Gamma\u2019s inclusion of a transgender woman.\nTitle IX \u2014 a federal law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in educational programs and activities \u2014 provides an exemption for the membership practices of social sororities and fraternities, as WyoFile previously\nreported\n.\n\u201cA sorority that admits male students is no longer a sorority by definition and thus loses the Title IX statutory exemption for a sorority\u2019s single-sex membership practices,\u201d the Department of Education stated in a\npress release\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Department of Education has the authority to determine who can be a member of a social sorority or fraternity.\nThe amended complaint reiterates the Trump administration\u2019s assertion, arguing that KKG\u2019s inclusion of transgender women \u201cis inconsistent with its reliance on the exemptions for \u2018single-sex\u2019 organizations under Title IX.\u201d\n\u201cBased on [Kappa Kappa Gamma\u2019s] bylaws\u2019 reference to and reliance on the \u2018exemption\u2019 in Title IX \u2026 the notion of a single-gender organization, as the phrase is used in the bylaws, must be read as synonymous with \u2018single sex,\u2019\u201d the complaint states.\nThe plaintiffs also point to an executive order President Donald Trump issued on his first day in office, and as such, Kappa\u2019s inclusion of transgender women \u201cis contrary to law.\u201d\n\u201cIn Executive Order 14168 \u2026 the terms \u2018women,\u2019 \u2018woman,\u2019 \u2018girls,\u2019 and \u2018girl,\u2019 are defined as \u2018adult and juvenile human females, respectively.\u2019 Further, \u2018sex\u2019 is defined as a person\u2019s \u2018immutable biological classification as male or female,\u2019 and the term specifically excludes the concept of \u2018gender identity,\u2019\u201d the complaint argues.\nMay Mailman,\nformer attorney\nfor the plaintiffs,\nhas been credited\nwith crafting the order alongside Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy.\nDuring her time representing the plaintiffs, Mailman worked as legal director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, a D.C.-based, right-wing policy group that attached itself to the case.

The reasons for his latest move are directly tied to the actions of his administration and, more specifically, the most visible arm of his anti-migrant policies.\nICE has been\nproblematic for years\n, but it took two non-consecutive Trump administrations to turn it into the cartoonish supervillain it is now. Even during his first term, no one really believed Trump only wanted to\nrid the country\nof the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d When he\ndisparaged entire countries as \u201cshitholes,\u201d\nit was clear he just wanted to rid the country of non-white people. When he granted\nwhite South Africans\nan exception to his \u201cno antisemites need apply\u201d immigration policies during his second term, he made it explicitly clear his anti-migrant stance only applied to people less (naturally) white than the badly spray-bronzed Boss Of The US.\nICE raids are now being greeted by massive protests\n, some of those impromptu gatherings generated by the sudden and unwelcome appearance of unmarked cars (and unmarked people) in mostly non-white neighborhoods. ICE agents \u2014\nand the federal agency conglomerate\ncurrently forced to help Trump stroke one out on main \u2014 are being chased out of neighborhoods and businesses by people who wish to protect their friends, neighbors, and families from a government determined to disregard their rights and remand anyone rounded up to the custody of the\nmost accommodating foreign gulag\n.\nIt\u2019s not just the big stuff \u2014 you know, the casual disregard of rights and deliberate refusal to abide by federal court orders. It\u2019s also the small stuff \u2014 the insidious destruction of societal and governmental norms for the sole purpose of pumping up deportation stats.\nThere\u2019s been a lot of attention paid to Los Angeles, California recently due to ongoing anti-ICE protests and the president\u2019s promise to\nlay the groundwork for martial law in response\n. Down in the trenches is where\nsome of the shittiest stuff is happening\n, which tends to get ignored because of what\u2019s happening out in broad daylight.\nMany undocumented immigrants who went to their Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointments at a federal building in Los Angeles this week were taken into custody and brought to the basement and held there, some overnight, according to immigration lawyers and family members.\nIt was unclear how many people were affected, but the attorneys told CBS News hundreds of immigrants were detained \u2014 dozens in the basement in rooms that could fit up to 30 at a time.\nOh, just going after the criminals? I mean, that\u2019s the narrative Trump clings to even as he undercuts it with each\nsubsequent statement or action\n. People just trying to comply with the law to further their attempt at citizenship or long-term residency are being scooped up solely because ICE knows a great place to find migrants to arrest is in courthouses where they\u2019re scheduled to attend hearings.\nIt\u2019s not just check-ins. It\u2019s pretty much any legal proceeding that\nmight\ninvolve an undocumented migrant.\nHere\u2019s something that hits more close to (my) home\nin a state that, fortunately, has only been subjected to\ntwo\nretaliatory raids by ICE agents.\nAccording to an emailed statement to KELOLAND News, Traci Smith with the Minnehaha County Public Defender\u2019s Office said, \u201cThe ICE agents\u2019 presence coincided with the presence of witnesses who had been subpoenaed to testify on behalf of the Defendant.\u201d\nSmith said jurors were on a break and many of them saw the ICE arrest, which happened in front of both the witnesses\u2019 wife and infant daughter.\n\u201cBecause of the scene it caused, the Judge declared a mistrial,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe witness had been lawfully subpoenaed to appear and testify. The actions of the prosecutor and ICE not only disrupted the trial but directly undermined the Defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial and caused irreparable harm to the judicial process.\u201d\nSmith said the person on trial is a U.S. citizen.\nYep, ICE hung out in a courthouse so they could ambush a migrant who was on a witness list in a criminal trial. The person on trial was an accused criminal. The person they arrested was doing their duty and responding to a subpoena. Even doing the right thing won\u2019t save you from Trump\u2019s antipathy towards migrants. (For that matter,\nneither will obtaining a REAL ID\n, which has been something millions of whiter Americans have been putting off for years because\u2026 well\u2026 the federal government has been\nputting it off for years\n.)\nThen there\u2019s the process that has nothing to do with due process: ICE agents show up to arrest people and\nthen\ntell them their green cards or visas have been revoked. Any government not clearly enamored with its own cruelty would immediately know it\u2019s unfair (and unconstitutional) to revoke immigration status without giving prior notice and allowing those affected to either arrange for legal representation or leave the country on their own terms. But that\u2019s not how it works now under Trump 2.0. Instead, the notification and arrest are\nsimultaneous\n. And those arrested are sent to detainment centers in judicially-friendly districts to short-circuit legal challenges.\nSomehow, it gets even shittier than everything listed above.\nHere\u2019s how government prosecutors are helping ICE inflate its deportation stats\n, something undoubtedly encouraged by their ultimate employer: Donald J. Trump.\nThe Trump administration has launched an operation to terminate the immigration court cases of certain migrants, in order to arrest them and place them in a fast-tracked deportation process instead, government officials and attorneys told CBS News.\nLawyers and advocates this week reported arrests of migrants outside of immigration courthouses across the U.S., saying teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had detained individuals whose cases in front of immigration judges had just been terminated at the request of the government.\nTwo Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News that ICE is conducting an operation to expedite the deportation of migrants with court hearings scheduled in the near future. It\u2019s the latest step taken by the Trump administration to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests across the country and fulfill what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in American history.\nAllowing charges to remain in place means allowing the court system to function properly and give those charged a chance to argue to defend themselves against these allegations. Dismissing the charges doesn\u2019t give migrants freedom they haven\u2019t earned yet, however. Instead, it reverts control of the case to immigration officials, who start expedited removal proceedings, which generally bypass courts entirely. Now, migrants utilizing the court system to make use of the rights extended to them by the US Constitution are finding those rights being unceremoniously stripped by prosecutors who, despite their oath, aren\u2019t actually serving the interest of justice, but rather the belabored brain bleed of a monstrous aspiring autocrat who believes the country serves him, rather than the other way around.\nSo, when you see ICE agents fleeing extended middle fingers and the occasional thrown object, never forget they\nchose\nto be a part of this. And when Trump threatens to bring the military into the war on migrants, always remember he picked this fight and now wants a bunch of other people to fight it for him. Finally, never forgive the people who say \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for this\u201d when they so very clearly\ndid\n. If you want fascism that might temporarily benefit you,\nown it\n. When it finally comes back to destroy the people and rights you actually care for, remember you were the one in the voting booth that day. Or, more likely, weren\u2019t anywhere near a voting booth when it mattered most.", "ped_digest": "P:Martial Law Staging|Anti-Migrant Policies Escalation|Disregard of Rights|Destruction of Societal Norms|Deportation Stat Pumping|Expedited Deportation Campaign|Operation to Terminate Immigration Court Cases;E:ICE Raids|Protests Against ICE|Arrests Outside Courthouses|Termination of Immigration Court Cases|Expedited Removal Proceedings|Mistrial Declaration|ICE Agents Ambush Migrant;D:Hundreds of Immigrants Detained|Rooms Fit Up to 30|Two Retaliatory Raids|Subpoenaed Witnesses|Infant Daughter Present|Millions of Whiter Americans Delaying REAL ID;", "er_digest": "N:KELOLAND News|ICE|CBS News|Department of Homeland Security|Traci Smith|Donald J.

Even then, it sold quite good for a Doom game.\nIf they release 3 Gears of War games on PS5 in a decade (and especially full priced) and they all look the same, then yes I would say the fatigue is real. This is literally the first time PS users will see Gears of War, with splitscreen, 120fps multiplayer and the whole package for $40.\nThis will easily sell a million copies in the first few months, even more once we get 50% discounts.

This newly identified snake species, measuring up to an astonishing 24.6 feet, has sparked a wave of excitement and fascination in the scientific world, underscoring the fact that there are still untapped mysteries waiting to be uncovered in the vast, biodiverse wilderness of the Amazon.\nThe Serpent that Was Never Meant to Be Found\nFor decades, the anaconda\u2014one of the largest snakes in the world\u2014has captivated imaginations and terrified those who dare to venture into the swamps and jungles where it lives. Known for its ability to constrict and overpower prey much larger than itself, the anaconda is already a creature of legendary proportions. But this latest discovery, made by a team of researchers from a prominent wildlife conservation group, introduces an even larger variety, setting a new record for the species.\nThe new\ngiant anaconda\nwas found in an area of the Amazon that had previously been considered too inaccessible for serious study. The team stumbled upon the massive snake during an expedition aimed at tracking the migration patterns of other species within the jungle. What they uncovered, however, was a game-changer\u2014a snake unlike any previously documented, both in size and behavior.\nWhy This Discovery Matters\nThe presence of this gigantic anaconda holds significant ecological and scientific importance. It proves that there are still corners of our planet, especially in the Amazon, that remain undiscovered and full of surprises. The snake\u2019s discovery sheds light on the complex and delicate ecosystems that exist in these largely uncharted territories.\nSee also\nStranger Things season 5 episode titles have been revealed !\nEcologists believe that the giant anaconda\u2019s sudden appearance is a reminder of the\nAmazon rainforest\u2019s\nimportance in global biodiversity. For years, conservationists have raised alarms about the destruction of habitats in the region due to logging, deforestation, and the expansion of human settlements. This discovery shows just how much we have yet to learn about this precious ecosystem, which is often referred to as the\nlungs of the\nEarth\n.\nThe New Giant: Characteristics and Behavior\nThis new anaconda species is even larger than its closest relatives, including the infamous green anaconda, which typically grows to about 20 feet in length. The newly discovered giant is not only longer but also notably heavier, with some estimates suggesting it can weigh up to 550 pounds.\nWhat sets it apart is not just its size, though. The giant anaconda has developed unique behavioral traits, especially in how it hunts and interacts with its environment. Unlike its smaller cousins, which primarily hunt smaller prey like rodents and birds, the giant anaconda seems capable of taking down\nlarger mammals\n\u2014a testament to its overwhelming physical power.\nSubscribe to the Glass Almanac YouTube channel\nResearchers are still studying its feeding habits, but early findings suggest that the giant anaconda can move swiftly through water and use ambush tactics to capture prey. Its hunting grounds seem to be concentrated around the rainforest\u2019s dense waterways, where it remains nearly invisible due to its coloration and the murky waters.\nThe Amazon: A Mysterious and Unexplored Frontier\nWhile the Amazon has long been known for its biodiversity, it continues to present new challenges and surprises to researchers. This latest discovery of the giant anaconda serves as a reminder of the vast unexplored regions within the rainforest. Over the years, scientists have only scratched the surface of what is hidden in these remote areas, and this new snake species is just one of many secrets that the Amazon still holds.\nSee also\nAutonomous Vehicle Tester at Tesla: The World\u2019s Most Stressful and Dangerous Job?\nWith deforestation and illegal logging activities accelerating, the future of the Amazon and its inhabitants\u2014like this newly discovered anaconda\u2014hangs in the balance. Many of the species in the Amazon are at risk of extinction before they are even discovered. Conservationists argue that this underscores the importance of protecting the rainforest, not only for its environmental benefits but also for the unknown species it continues to shelter.\nThe Global Significance of the Discovery\nThis giant anaconda is more than just a fascinating find\u2014it\u2019s a crucial piece of the puzzle when it comes to understanding the balance of life within the Amazon rainforest. The region plays a central role in carbon sequestration and is vital to controlling the Earth\u2019s climate. Discoveries like this new species offer not only scientific insights but also strengthen the argument for sustainable practices that can protect ecosystems and species that we are only beginning to understand.\nFor now, the discovery of the giant anaconda leaves us with more questions than answers. How many other unknown species are out there waiting to be discovered? And what are the broader implications of their existence in this delicate ecosystem? As scientists continue to study the creature and its environment, we can only hope that the Amazon will remain a sanctuary for such incredible discoveries for generations to come\nSimilar Posts\nGiant anaconda never seen before discovered in the Amazon with Will Smith\nDiscovery of a giant snake scientists say it might be the largest ever recorded\nA new deep-sea predator has just been found by scientists\nNew Deep-Ocean Predator Discovered by Researchers\nNew Deep-Ocean Predator Discovered by Researchers\nSee also\nRemove These 12 Android Apps Now\u2014They\u2019re Secretly Capturing Your Conversations\nRate this post\nShare this Post:\nWhatsApp\nShare\nFind and win\nA treasure is hidden in this article!\nShare it\nto start the game and try to uncover the secret word. \nThe first 10 people to submit it via the form that appears after you share will\nwin a surprise prize\n!\nGood luck\nSubscribe to the Glass Almanac YouTube channel\nShare to...\nBluesky\nBuffer\nCopy\nEmail\nFlipboard\nHacker News\nLine\nMastodon\nMessenger\nMix\nPocket\nPrint\nSMS\nSubscribe\nTelegram\nThreads\nTumblr\nVK\nWhatsApp\nXing\nYummly", "ped_digest": "P:New Anaconda Species Discovered|Record-Breaking Size|Ecological Significance|Conservation Importance|Sustainable Practices;E:Anaconda Discovery in Amazon|Expedition Uncovers New Species|Researchers Study Feeding Habits|Deforestation Threatens Amazon|Scientists Seek Answers About Ecosystem;D:24.6 Feet Length|550 Pounds Weight|20 Feet Green Anaconda Length|Amazon Rainforest Location|Carbon Sequestration Role;", "er_digest": "N:Will Smith|Brian Foster|Tesla;R:Amazon Rainforest|South America;", "gist": "P:New Anaconda Species Discovered|Record-Breaking Size|Ecological Significance|Conservation Importance|Sustainable Practices;E:Anaconda Discovery in Amazon|Expedition Uncovers New Species|Researchers Study Feeding Habits|Deforestation Threatens Amazon|Scientists Seek Answers About Ecosystem;D:24.6 Feet Length|550 Pounds Weight|20 Feet Green Anaconda Length|Amazon Rainforest Location|Carbon Sequestration Role;N:Will Smith|Brian Foster|Tesla;R:Amazon Rainforest|South America;", "entities": ["Will Smith", "Brian Foster", "Tesla"], "regions": ["Amazon Rainforest", "South America"]}, {"_id": "https://thegeorgiasun.com/crime/norcross-robbery-suspects-held-clerk-at-gunpoint-while-baby-was-in-store/", "content": "Skip to content\nThe Georgia Sun\nLatest Georgia News, Local Events, Weather and Statewide Updates\nSupport Local Journalism\nPosted in\nCrime\nNorcross Robbery Suspects Held Clerk at Gunpoint While Baby Was in Store\nby\nB.T.

So I ask you all to pray for more like these.\u201d\nFisher then made a heartfelt appeal to young Catholic men: \u201cPeople are crying out for words of life and sacraments of grace to transfigure their hearts and lives. You might be the very one by God\u2019s grace to offer them this as a Dominican priest.\u201d\nYour support makes stories like this possible!\nLifeSiteNews is completely donor supported, allowing us to report on what truly is happening in the world, free of charge and uncensored.

With more and more application developers opting for GNOME's Libadwaita because of the desktop environment's popularity, many popular GTK applications now look like GNOME applications instead of GTK applications, and they just don't mesh well with traditional GTK desktops. Since Libadwaita is not themeable, applications that use it can't really be made to feel at home on non-GNOME GTK desktops, unless said desktops adopt the entire GNOME design language, handing over control ovr their GUI design to outsiders in the process.\nThe developers of Libadwaita, as well as the people behind GNOME, have made it very clear they do not intend to make Libadwaita themeable, and they are well within their rights to make that decision. I think it's a bad decision - themeing is a crucial accessibility feature - but it's their project, their code, and their time, and I fully respect their decision, since it's really not up to GNOME to worry about the other GTK desktops. So, what are the developers of Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon supposed to do?\nWell, how about taking matters into their own hands? Clement Lefebvre, the lead developer of Linux Mint and its Cinnamon desktop environment, has soft-forked Libadwaita to add theme support to the library. They're calling it [LibAdapta](https://github.com/xapp-project/libadapta).\n> libAdapta is libAdwaita with theme support and a few extra.\n> It provides the same features and the same look as libAdwaita by default.\n> In desktop environments which provide theme selection, libAdapta apps follow the theme and use the proper window controls.\n> [\u21ab LibAdapta's GitHub page](https://github.com/xapp-project/libadapta)\nThe reason they consider libAdapta a \"soft-fork\" is that all it does is add theme support; they do not intended to deviate from Libadwaita in any other way, and will follow Libadwaita's releases. It will use the current GTK3 theme, and will fallback to the default Libadwaita look and feel if the GTK3 theme in question doesn't have a `libadapta-1.0` directory. This seems like a transparent and smart way to handle it.\nI doubt it will be long before libAdapta becomes a default part of a lot of user instructions online, GTK theme developers will probably add support for it pretty quickly, and perhaps even of a lot of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments will add it by default.

The acclaimed actor\u2019s admission sheds light on a potentially different trajectory for both his career and the iconic space saga.\nThe Star Wars franchise, which began in 1977 with George Lucas at the helm, has grown to include 12 films and has featured prominent actors like Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. The series has become one of Hollywood\u2019s most successful franchises, spawning numerous spinoffs and generating billions in revenue. Its growth also opened doors for many actors who became central to its legacy, even though some major names,\nincluding those originally considered, never made it to the screen\n.\nDuring a recent chat with\nEntertainment Weekly\n, Pacino recalled receiving the script while he was performing in a Broadway show. \u201cSo I loved their work, but I was doing a show on Broadway at the time, and they handed me this script, and I thought, I don\u2019t understand. I must be out of space myself,\u201d the actor explained. His confusion about the material led him to seek guidance from his friend and mentor, Charlie Loughton.\nStar Wars\u2019 continued success without Pacino\u2019s involvement\nThe decision to decline the role came after both Pacino and Loughton struggled to comprehend the script\u2019s content. \u201cI said, \u2018What do you make of this?\u2019 He was pretty wise and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t get it, Al. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Pacino shared. Despite being offered what he described as \u201ca fortune,\u201d the actor stood firm in his belief that he couldn\u2019t perform in something he didn\u2019t fully understand.\nAl Pacino on why he turned down the role of Han Solo in 1977\n\"I said \u2018I think I\u2019m in the mood to make Harrison Ford a career'\"\nvia\n@EW\npic.twitter.com/8IXNncLvgS\n\u2014 Youtini (@youtini_us)\nJune 9, 2025\nThe franchise has continued to thrive without Pacino\u2019s involvement, with its most recent installment, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, released in 2019 under the direction of J.J. Abrams. Meanwhile,\nLucasfilm has already begun laying plans for post\u2011Skywalker projects\n.\nPacino\u2019s career has remained illustrious despite passing on the Star Wars opportunity. The actor has maintained a steady presence in Hollywood, with his latest project being The Ritual, directed by David Midell, which was released on June 6. The film sees him starring alongside Abigail Cowen, demonstrating his continued appeal in the industry.\nThis revelation joins a growing list of \u201cwhat if\u201d moments in Hollywood history, where major actors have declined roles in successful franchises. However, Pacino\u2019s honest explanation, \u201cI can\u2019t play something if I don\u2019t speak the language,\u201d reflects his commitment to only taking on roles he fully understands and can authentically portray.", "ped_digest": "P:Al Pacino turned down a role in Star Wars|Star Wars franchise continued success without Pacino|Pacino prioritizes understanding roles|Pacino's career remains successful|Lucasfilm plans post-Skywalker projects;E:Pacino received the Star Wars script in 1977|Pacino consulted with Charlie Loughton about the script|Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker released in 2019|The Ritual, directed by David Midell, released on June 6;D:Star Wars franchise includes 12 films|Franchise generated billions in revenue|Star Wars began in 1977|J.J.

I think my friends are discernibly better than I am, and that means I\u2019m doing something right. The people I love most are wildly smart, but they also have a moral character that I aspire to\u2014I see them being kind and forgiving at the exact moments I\u2019m tempted to be snarky and mean.\nAs a matchmaker, people often articulate to me their desire for a partner whose judgment they trust. It\u2019s easy to know what you\u2019re looking for when you trust your friends, and the way they make decisions big and small. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s impossible to be truly intimate with someone when you\u2019re privately judging their decisions while politely nodding along. I decided last year that I would always say what I really thought as tactfully as possible. Maybe not three times, but at least once. When I lie to my friends, even merely through withholding my true opinion, I\u2019m making a decision for them instead of letting them choose.\nbookbear express is enabled by paying subscribers. thank you for your support <3\nWe all have blind spots. People who love and understand you can point things out to you that you don\u2019t see. I find talking to Claude useful for the same reason\u2014having the facts distilled and reflected back to you can help you accept reality. We all think we know ourselves the best, but having\ntoo much context\ncan actually distort your perspective on the situation.\nTo some extent, your ability to be in a healthy romantic relationship is predicated on your ability to be in healthy platonic relationships. To be fair, a lot of people have the latter without the former, but I think relatively few have the former without the latter. Friends and family are what enable our partners to be a lot\nto us without having to be\neverything\n.\nEveryone agrees with this conceptually, but most people have relatively little interest in living it.\nMaking friends is impossible as an adult. It\u2019s impossible, I don\u2019t have time. I just don\u2019t connect with anyone in the city I live in.\nWe\u2019re taught that we should work hard to get into and sustain romantic relationships, but friendships are supposed to be automatic and effortless. If you have to try, aren\u2019t you doing something wrong?\nOf course, the reason why most people don\u2019t have friends isn\u2019t because they never made them, but because they lost them over time. Maintenance is always the battle in love and in work. Asking your friends for advice doesn\u2019t just serve you\u2014your vulnerability and trust serve the relationship, as long as you make space to pay it back in kind.\nThe rewards and challenges of romantic relationships are so much more prominent in our culture than those of friendship. We\u2019re presented with a straightforward narrative: meet the right person, marry them, and you\u2019ll have figured out a major part of life. It\u2019s no wonder that people often neglect close friends or renounce them or a partner. I\u2019m certainly guilty of dropping off the map for long periods of time because I\u2019m preoccupied or conflicted. But friendships can be amazingly robust and consistent, life rafts in times of need\u2014several of my closest friendships are about to hit the 10-year mark, which means they have outlived any romantic relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. My friends have slowly and gently changed me, like water gradually shaping a shoreline.\nIn the past couple years, I\u2019ve experienced plenty of upheaval and change in my personal and professional life. It\u2019s been amazing to witness the way my friends have held and supported me through it. I am not strange to them: I am familiar, known, and loved.\n33\nShare this post\nbookbear express\nwho do you go to for advice?\nCopy link\nFacebook\nEmail\nNotes\nMore\n1\n4\nShare\nDiscussion about this post\nNo posts\nReady for more?\n\u00a9 2025 Ava Huang\nPrivacy\n\u2219\nTerms\n\u2219\nCollection notice\nStart writing\nGet the app\nSubstack\nis the home for great culture\nShare\nCopy link\nFacebook\nEmail\nNotes\nMore", "ped_digest": "P:Advice seeking|Importance of trusted judgment|Value of friends' moral character|Blind spots and self-perception|Healthy relationships require healthy friendships|Maintenance of relationships is crucial|Neglect of friendships in favor of romantic relationships|Longevity of friendships|Supportive role of friends during upheaval|Friends provide familiarity and love;E:Bookbear Express matchmaking launch|Announcement of free matchmaking service|Discussion of the \"average of the five people\" concept|Reflection on personal growth through friendships|Emphasis on honest communication with friends|Exploration of the challenges of making friends as an adult|Recognition of the loss of friendships over time|Comparison of romantic and platonic relationship narratives|Experience of upheaval and change supported by friends;D:33 (age)|1 (Ragnar Sandberg's artwork)|10-year mark of several friendships|Substack platform|Claude AI used for advice|Reference to \"too much context\" distorting perspective;", "er_digest": "N:Ragnar Sandberg|Facebook|Ava|Bookbear Express|Substack|Claude|Sam;", "gist": "P:Advice seeking|Importance of trusted judgment|Value of friends' moral character|Blind spots and self-perception|Healthy relationships require healthy friendships|Maintenance of relationships is crucial|Neglect of friendships in favor of romantic relationships|Longevity of friendships|Supportive role of friends during upheaval|Friends provide familiarity and love;E:Bookbear Express matchmaking launch|Announcement of free matchmaking service|Discussion of the \"average of the five people\" concept|Reflection on personal growth through friendships|Emphasis on honest communication with friends|Exploration of the challenges of making friends as an adult|Recognition of the loss of friendships over time|Comparison of romantic and platonic relationship narratives|Experience of upheaval and change supported by friends;D:33 (age)|1 (Ragnar Sandberg's artwork)|10-year mark of several friendships|Substack platform|Claude AI used for advice|Reference to \"too much context\" distorting perspective;N:Ragnar Sandberg|Facebook|Ava|Bookbear Express|Substack|Claude|Sam;", "entities": ["Ragnar Sandberg", "Facebook", "Ava", "Bookbear Express", "Substack", "Claude", "Sam"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://ukrainetoday.org/they-cant-even-defeat-ukraine-orban-called-the-russians-too-weak-to-attack-nato/", "content": "Ukraine Today .org\nToday we are all Ukrainian\nJune 9, 2025\nBill B.\nUKRAINE STRIKES BACK HARD: KAZAN, CHEBOKSARY, SAVASLEKA AIR BASE Vlog 1069: War in Ukraine (video commentary)\nJune 9, 2025\nBill B.\nDay 1202: Ukrainian Map (video commentary)\nJune 9, 2025\nonlyfactsplease\nUkraine\u2019s Long-Range Revenge: 159 Russian War Factories BURNING!\nJune 9, 2025\nJune 9, 2025\nveth\nWhite House can\u2019t find qualified people willing to work for Hegseth \u2013 NBC News\nJune 9, 2025\nveth\nMoscow no longer believes in NATO\u2019s Article 5, says German intelligence\nJune 9, 2025\nonlyfactsplease\n\u201cThey can\u2019t even defeat Ukraine\u201d: Orban called the Russians too weak to attack NATO\nJune 9, 2025\nonlyfactsplease\nU.S. Orders Additional VAMPIRE Air Defense Systems Used in Ukraine\nJune 9, 2025\nonlyfactsplease\nAuthorities fine Russians for filming sites hit by Ukrainian drones\nJune 9, 2025\nonlyfactsplease\nUkraine\u2019s Air Defenders Reveal How They Neutralized Seven Drones Over Kyiv (Video)\nJune 9, 2025\nJune 9, 2025\nfoccusser\nBREAKING: Orban BETRAYS Putin?!

There is also a selection whose activities extend beyond the small screen to feature themselves in full-fledged stage performances or live concerts as a proper 3D performer. This type of VTuber can also be considered a type of virtual idol/virtual singer, of which there exists a sizable portion, and overlap between the two is a common sight.\u200b\nSome who call themselves a VTuber will elect to remain 100% anonymous for their VTubing career. Others opt for a more hybridized approach, presenting themselves in real life as well as in virtual form.\u200b\nDespite the name, they do not have to be on YouTube to be a 'VTuber'; any platform of preference, such as Twitch, TikTok, or Bilibili, can be called home. In some instances, labels like 'VStreamer', along with other variations, have been used, but 'VTuber' remains the most commonplace term regardless of origin. _(Please see the**FAQ** below for more answers to some of the most common questions regarding VTubing!)_\n**\u26a1 [_WHY WATCH VTUBERS?_]**\nVTubers are a form of new-media entertainment that combine elements of various internet cultures and subcultures. As a result, its format draws from many different entertainment models. Part of the appeal of VTubing is the virtual domain it inhabits: it is not bound by physical limitations. A VTuber can be anybody, or anything, they wish to be, no matter the world outside their computer. A VTuber can use animation, digital assets, and illustrations to convey the reality of their choosing in a medium-consistent manner -- and they can maintain a sense of anonymity and privacy while doing it.\nFor fans of anime/cartoons/games, watching and following VTubers can also feel a little bit like all of that combined. CGI characters with cool visuals with which you can freely interact, whose 'story' you can contribute to; kayfabe allowing for 'roleplay' and character lore (and even more lore/character BREAKS, but that's part of the charm); and celebrating milestones such as subscriber/follower count, getting a new outfit, getting a 3D model, and more. They can also just be: \u2705 Silly \u2705 Cute \u2705 Funny sometimes \u2705 Very talented/creative\u200b\n\u200b\n**\u26a1 [_WHAT VTUBERS ARE OUT THERE?_]**\n**The story of VTubing begins in 2016, in Japan, with a 'klutzy artificial intelligence' [not an actual AI; see FAQ] named Kizuna Ai. But since 2020, it has spread throughout the globe, and grown in presence -- and population -- with each consecutive year. Today, tens of thousands of VTubers have come, gone, and stayed, and hundreds more emerge every several months. VTubers come in all shapes and sizes; some people use a VTuber-style presentation, but are otherwise detached from core VTubing culture. Some try to push the envelope of the medium, harnessing it in innovative ways (**[**CodeMiko**](https://www.twitch.tv/codemiko)**, anyone?). Some are anime girls, some are talking horse heads. Some sing; some game; some just chat. Many do all three. The large majority of VTubers are indies, and the majority of that majority are small and homegrown, with minimal financial backing and a lot of DIY.** On the other side of the coin, as the scene grew, more and more VTuber agencies rose to prominence: companies formed to provide branding support, funding, and networking to and management for aspiring virtual entertainers. Today, many of the highest-profile and most famous VTubers are contracted under a company (aka, \"corpo VTuber\"). The banner directly above comprises of several major VTuber agencies from around the world who are currently active as of this posting. Of the currently active corps, the two biggest and most famous right now, both based in Japan, are\u200b\n\u2022 [Hololive](https://www.hololive.tv/), managed by COVER Corp. Also the group to which [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/@GawrGura) belongs. They have some of the biggest VTubers in the world with a multitude of talents in the 1-million-subscriber range. While their main, girl-only branch is HololiveJP (Japan), other branches include ID (Indonesia), EN (English), and Dev_IS (a unit-focused branch). They are also home to Holostars, a male-only group, which consists of a JP and EN branch. Fashioned as a semi-\"idol\" group, Hololive has a stronger focus on musical projects, but with just how sweaty-gamer, multi-talented, and 'mischievous' its members can prove to be, the bigger picture can be a little more colorful. \u2022 [Nijisanji](https://www.nijisanji.jp/en), managed by ANYCOLOR Inc. Some may recognize the mug of [Vox Akuma](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckdfYDGrjojJM28n5SHYrA). The biggest VTuber agency in the world, Nijisanji refers to their talents as '_virtual livers_ ' (as in going 'live') and has over 170 members, several of which are the most well-known VTubers in the industry. They have two primary branches: the eponymous Nijisanji (Japan + legacy members of now-dissolved international branches), sometimes unofficially referred to as 'NijisanjiJP', and NijisanjiEN (English). They also have a sister group, [VirtuaReal](https://space.bilibili.com/413748120/), based in China. Nijisanji is a huge group and the main pioneer of the Live2D format (streaming with 2D models), with a wide variety of members and niches represented. Chances are, there'll be at least one VTuber you like in there!\u200b\n[VSPO!](https://www.youtube.com/@Vspo77) and [Neo-Porte](https://neo-porte.jp/) are also not far behind in size, the former being the third-biggest VTuber agency in JP by subscriber count. These two have a stronger eSports focus. [Kamitsubaki Studio](https://kamitsubaki.jp/) is a music label that specializes in VSingers, including one of their biggest names, [KAF](https://www.youtube.com/@virtual_kaf). Other agencies include [Nanashiinku](https://www.774.ai/), possessing a wide variety of VTubers with numerous sub-groups; [NoriPro](https://noripro.jp/), an agency founded by Norio Tsukudani, herself a VTuber, mangaka, illustrator, and dancer; [dotLive](https://vrlive.party/member/), one of the oldest running VTuber agencies alongside Hololive and home to the one of the original 'Four Heavenly Kings', Denno Shojo Siro; and many more.\u200b\nMeanwhile, from the western/English-speaking world, some of the most prominent VTuber agencies are\u200b\n\u2022 [VShojo](https://www.vshojo.com/), a 'talent-first' agency that operates on a different model from the typical Eastern format, allowing VTubers to retain their IP and much more freedom. The VShojo talents comprise of some of the biggest names in EN VTubing, including [Ironmouse](https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse) and [Zentreya](https://www.twitch.tv/zentreya), and unlike most companies, are primarily scout/recruitment-only, openings for auditions being a rarity. \u2022 [Phase-Connect](https://phase-connect.com/), a western-targeted VTuber agency that originally launched with both JP and EN members. Based out of Vancouver, Canada, Phase-Connect made a splash in 2021 and have grown in number and scale ever since, developing into one of the biggest Youtube-based agencies in the western market. Their style tends to reject the 'cleaner' image of the bigger JP-based agencies on the site and have gained a reputation as such. \u2022 [Idol Corp](https://idol-company.com/), one of the past two years' dark horses. Despite launching in 2022, they started to gain prominence in 2023 and by the end of the year became one of the most well-known VTuber agencies in the western world, featuring British wisecracks like [Rin Penrose](https://www.youtube.com/@rinpenrose) and mafia bosses such as [Kattarina Qutie](https://www.youtube.com/@kattarina_qutie). \u2022 [Prism Project](https://www.prismproject.jp/), a 'multinational', western-targeted agency that has cultivated a devoted following over the years and serves as home to numerous VTubers with a range of talents, both musically and elsewhere, [Shiki Miyoshino](https://www.youtube.com/@ShikiMiyoshino) being just one example. Since 2022, they have been owned by Sony Music Entertainment.\u200b\nThere is also [Mythic](https://www.mythictalent.com/), a Twitch-based talent management company that is home to some of the biggest VTubers on Twitch alongside VShojo. However, Mythic is not VTuber-exclusive, host to both real-life and virtual members, and arguably has even less direct involvement with a VTuber's individual activities and brand than VShojo; as such, the majority of VTubers under Mythic are still considered 'indie', while VTubers under VShojo are considered 'indie with corpo benefits' (although in reality, the latter is simply in adoption of a model inspired more by Western conventions as opposed to the heavily managed Eastern model traditionally practiced in the industry).\u200b\n[Isegye Idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDFUl2mHIW4) and [V&U](https://www.youtube.com/@VNUEntertain), two of the most well-known groups based out of South Korea. [Neo-Baka](https://www.youtube.com/@NEOBAKA), a high profile agency local to Brazil. [Maha5](https://www.youtube.com/@MAHA5official), a major Indonesia-based company also featuring JP talents.\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u26a1 [_VTUBER ETIQUETTE/THREAD GUIDELINES_] (_please read_)\n**1)** _Egregious doxxing of talents {including unauthorized face reveals and other identifying information) is forbidden_. However, talking about 'past lives' and personal accounts can be allowed only under certain conditions and extents:\u200b\n\u2022 No blatant posting of 'VTuber/Person A is VTuber/Person B', in that exact format, out in the open; if you have to candidly disclose a VTuber's 'incarnations', please do so in spoiler tags and non-habitually \u2022 On the other hand, bringing up a VTuber's or former VTuber's personal account, indie account, or past life _without spoilers_ is permitted _as long as_ you abide by the condition directly above and avoid explicitly stating that both people are the same person -- in other words, an 'if you know, you know' implied approach should be fine \u2022 Try to keep discussions surrounding a VTuber's past life or non-VTuber account to a minimum; talking about the history of things and referencing past moments when topical are fine and realistically, sometimes it's unavoidable and impossible to walk around eggshells for certain news or when discussing the more high-profile VTubers all the time, and that's okay from time to time. But _the general priority should be given to the VTuber's current, active persona_.\u200b\n**2)** In this corner of the web, the conversation will mostly be dominated by Hololive and Nijisanji -- but _don't be afraid to bring up indies and other/smaller VTubers you like too_! A lot of people who otherwise wouldn't be exposed to them have been introduced to other VTubers this way in past threads. **3)** When watching a VTuber live, _please pay attention to the VTuber's stream/chat rules_ if they have such a list up. List or not, the common defacto rules in JP Vtubing amounts to: _stay on topic, don't converse with other viewers, avoid bringing up other VTubers unless the streamer did so first, don't spam, and, of course,**be respectful**_. If you are unsure of how to conduct yourself, it's advisable to see what the atmosphere is like between the VTuber and their chat before jumping in. **4)** _Be wary_ of 'dramatubers' (drama focused VTuber channels) and unreliable clippers who are known for inaccurate translations (e.g. Otakmori). The latter can end up instigating drama and misinformation via their clips, while the former will rely on shock value to bait viewers/engagement. **5)** Abide by the official ResetEra Terms and Conditions when posting in the thread.\n\u26a1 [_F.A.Q_]\n\u200b\n> **ARE VTUBERS A.I.?** \u200b\n> While there are [VTubers that are purely AI](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987), they are presently a novelty and very experimental. VTubers are generally human beings using digital avatars and always had begun as such.\u200b\n> **WHY ARE VTUBERS MOSTLY GIRLS? WHERE ARE THE BOYS??** \u200b\n> A lot of the most popular ones are, and a higher proportion of female VTubers get more traction than males on average. But there are plenty of male VTubers that have become hugely popular as well, such as Kuzuha and Kanae from Nijisanji, Astel Leda and Yukoku Roberu from Holostars, Shibuya HAL from Neo-Porte, Vox Akuma and Shu Yamino from NijisanjiEN, etc.\u200b\n> **DO ALL VTUBERS USE VOICE CHANGERS?** \u200b\n> No, many of them just have a tendency to use a more excited or raised tone of speech, especially JP based ones. However, those that do use voice changers exist.\u200b\n> **WHY DO MOST VTUBERS LOOK LIKE ANIME CHARACTERS?** \u200b\n> Having its roots in Japan, the VTubing scene is most recognizable for its anime style aesthetics prominent among some of the biggest names in the VTubing world. But you don't need to be full-on 'anime' to be a VTuber. [Miss Lala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF2_3bTjsSQ) uses a blend of anime + Americana, for instance, and [Pumpkin Potion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlIfV7Ci9ts) draws on classic American cartoon aesthetics.\u200b\n> **I WANT TO WATCH ALL THE POPULAR JAPANESE VTUBERS. HOW DO I DO THIS IF I SUCK AT JAPANESE?** \u200b\n> Tune in anyway! Some of the biggest JP VTubers will have live translators in the chat, if you're lucky. And some things transcend words, like _unadulterated silliness_. But if that's still a bit big of a jump, then you can start with clips or compilations. There is a large amount of clippers that edit and translate certain VTubers' streams into digestible portions; this is a critical building block in the international community, and helps those of us untrained in the language to be entertained along with those overseas. And when you've had your fill with that, joining one of the VTuber's/VTuber agency's more sizable fan Discord channels will often introduce you to other fans who can also provide help in understanding the latest news and streams from them.\u200b\n> **WHAT SOFTWARE IS USED TO DO VTUBING?** \u200b\n> Live2D and VTube Studio are most often used to animate models. For streaming, the usual suspects like OBS are commonly used. \u200b\n> \u200b\n> Click to expand...\n> Click to shrink...\n\u200b\n\u26a1 [_RESOURCES/TOOLS_]\nWant to be a VTuber?

Devs warned to check dependencies for express-api-sync, system-health-sync-api.\nby\nWaqas\nJune 9, 2025\n3 minute read\nTotal\n0\nShares\nSecurity researchers have identified two npm packages that do far more than they claim. Disguised as utilities for system monitoring and data syncing, these packages introduce destructive backdoors that can remotely wipe out all files in a developer\u2019s application, on demand.\nSocket\u2019s Threat Research Team exposed the malicious packages,\nexpress-api-sync\nand\nsystem-health-sync-api\n, both published under the npm account \u201cbotsailer.\u201d While the names suggest harmless functionality, the underlying code tells a much darker story.\nA Dangerous Disguise\nAccording to the company\u2019s technical\nreport\nshared with Hackread.com, the\nexpress-api-sync\npackage presents itself as a simple tool for syncing databases. But instead of syncing anything, it injects a hidden HTTP POST endpoint (\n/api/this/that\n) into any Express app that includes it.\nOnce triggered with the hardcoded key \u201cDEFAULT_123,\u201d it executes the Unix command\nrm -rf *\n, effectively erasing everything in the application\u2019s current directory, source code, configs, user uploads, and even local databases.\nThis attack activates silently. No logs, no console output, and thanks to an empty error handler, no indication if the route registration fails. Most developers wouldn\u2019t notice anything unusual until it\u2019s too late.\nSophisticated Threat\nWhile express-api-sync is destructive, system-health-sync-api takes things further. It\u2019s structured like a real system monitor, complete with a functioning health check, SMTP integration, and dynamic support for Express, Fastify, and even raw HTTP servers.\nBeneath the surface, it gathers server data, hostname, IP, process ID, and environment hash, and sends it via email to a hardcoded address:\nanupm019@gmailcom\n. It even logs backend URLs, helping attackers map server infrastructure.\nThis package supports cross-platform file deletion:\nrm -rf *\nfor Unix-based systems and\nrd /s /q .\nfor Windows, a command that doesn\u2019t just delete files, it wipes the current directory entirely.\nBuilt-In Command and Control\nThe backdoor can be triggered via two POST endpoints (\n/_/system/health\nand\n/_/sys/maintenance\n), each requiring the secret key \u201cHelloWorld.\u201d Developers might think the configuration is customizable, but default values ensure the attacker\u2019s access works unless settings are explicitly overridden.\nEmail is used as a covert control channel. SMTP credentials are baked into the package, masked with Base64 encoding but easily decoded. When the system starts, the malware checks connectivity to the mail server. If successful, it confirms that the attacker\u2019s command channel is active.\nHow It Works Behind the Scenes\nReconnaissance\n: A GET request to\n/_/system/health\nreturns system info.\nDry Run (optional)\n: If configured, attackers can test without causing damage.\nDestruction\n: A POST request with the right key triggers full file deletion.\nNotification\n: Email alerts are sent with detailed server fingerprints and backend URLs.\nThe package even adjusts responses to help attackers understand when keys are incorrect, offering hints on proper usage.\nMost\nsupply chain attacks\nfocus on stealing data or cryptocurrency. These two packages aim for destruction. It\u2019s a shift in motivation, from profit to sabotage. Attackers now appear more interested in taking systems offline, collecting infrastructure intel, or disrupting competitors. And they\u2019re building tools that can sit dormant, gather information, and activate when least expected.\nThe use of middleware makes this even more dangerous. Middleware runs on every request and often has full access to app internals. These packages exploit that trust, quietly embedding routes with the power to destroy an entire production environment.\n, Chief Trust Officer at Saviynt, commented on the latest development, stating, \u201cThis is a case of a software supply chain compromise using malware designed to appear to be benign that then activates a back door once it is embedded. The key for enterprises is to improve the identity access management for everyone with access to the software build process including employees and contractors.\u201d\nDevelopers and DevOps teams\nshould review their dependencies immediately. Use behavioural scanning tools that inspect what packages do, not just what they claim. Traditional scanners miss these threats because they don\u2019t look at runtime behaviour.\nWaqas\nI am a UK-based cybersecurity journalist with a passion for covering the latest happenings in cybersecurity and tech world.

Woodbury (R) of JPW + Dad Weed celebrate the release of their record,\nAmassed Like A Rat King\n, on Saturday, June 14, at the Dirty Drummer in Phoenix.\nPatrick Sexton\nShare this:\nAudio By Carbonatix\n[\n     {\n      \"name\": \"GPT - Billboard - Slot Inline - Content - Labeled - No Desktop\",\n      \"component\": \"21251496\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"2\",\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"2\"\n     },{\n      \"name\": \"STN Player - Float - Mobile Only \",\n      \"component\": \"21327862\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"2\",\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"2\"\n     },{\n      \"name\": \"Editor Picks\",\n      \"component\": \"16759093\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"4\",\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"1\"\n     },{\n      \"name\": \"Inline Links\",\n      \"component\": \"17980324\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"8th\",\n      \"startingPoint\": 8,\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"7\",\n      \"maxInsertions\": 25\n     },{\n      \"name\": \"GPT - Rectangle 2x - Slot Auto-select - Labeled\",\n      \"component\": \"21251488\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"8th\",\n      \"startingPoint\": 8,\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"7\",\n      \"maxInsertions\": 25\n     },{\n      \"name\": \"Inline Links\",\n      \"component\": \"17980324\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"8th\",\n      \"startingPoint\": 12,\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"11\",\n      \"maxInsertions\": 25\n     },{\n      \"name\": \"GPT - Leaderboard to Tower - Slot Auto-select - Labeled\",\n      \"component\": \"17012245\",\n      \"insertPoint\": \"8th\",\n      \"startingPoint\": 12,\n      \"requiredCountToDisplay\": \"11\",\n      \"maxInsertions\": 25\n     }\n    ]\n\u201cAmassed Like a Rat King\u201d by JPW + Dad Weed starts off with the coolest, fattest bass line to come from the greater Phoenix area in a long time. The song is the title track from the duo\u2019s killer new record, and as great as the bass line is, it is just the tip of a very catchy, indie pop iceberg. \n  This particular gem is not about to start sinking any cruise ships, though, so don\u2019t go calling for the lifeboats yet. Once you turn on the song, no one is going anywhere. The rats that Jason P. Woodbury (JPW) sings about in \u201cAmassed Like a Rat King\u201d are too busy boogie-ing their collective asses off to desert any sinking ships thanks to that butt shaking bass groove.\n  The song was the first track that Woodbury and collaborator Zachary Toporek (the Dad Weed part of the equation) created for the record (released in April on Fort Lowell Records), and it is a reflection of some tall tales told by Woodbury\u2019s uncles in his youth.\n  \u201cI guess I\u2019m literally reflecting on the nature of a rat king, which is a bunch of rats stuck together inextricably. It\u2019s kind of a gnarly, metal-sounding thing, but really that song in particular is me kind of reflecting on my youth and the machine shop, Cherokee Saw and Tool, that my family owned in Coolidge when I was young,\u201d says Woodbury. \n  Apparently, an eight-year-old Woodbury liked to wander around the big building, and his uncles would tell him about finding a \u2018rat king\u2019 in there to scare him. It\u2019s kind of amazing that such a pop gem came from such a revolting thought, but with a lyricist like Woodbury at the helm, mining life events for lyrical gems is commonplace. \n  As\nAmassed Like a Rat King\ncontinues beyond the title song, the strength of Toporek and Woodbury\u2019s collaboration is palpable. The two played all the instruments and did all the vocals across the 11 tracks, with Toporek engineering the recording prior to handing it off to the incomparable Sam Cohen for mixing. \n  \u201cWe cannot sing Sam\u2019s praises enough because this record sounded pretty good before we sent it to him, but he really understood the vision and took it to 4K,\u201d says Toporek.\n  \u201cSam\u2019s credits are vast. He\u2019s worked with Kevin Morby, Danger Mouse and Karen O.\u00a0 \u2014 so many people (including Norah Jones, Bob Weir, and Shakira). It was beyond a treat to work with him. He mixed the record at Slow Fawn, his studio in upstate New York,\u201d adds Woodbury.\n  It\u2019s super charming how much Toporek and Woodbury seem to love working together. Beyond occasionally finishing each other\u2019s sentences and making each other laugh throughout our phone conversation, the two clearly \u2018get\u2019 each other as people and musicians.\nAmassed Like a Rat King\ndoes not sound like the work of just two Phoenix dudes hanging out and having a good time together, but that\u2019s exactly what the record is and faithfully represents. \n  While both artists have released recordings separately, Woodbury as JPW, and Toporek as Dad Weed, they have been frequent collaborators in each other\u2019s projects and have played together live on multiple occasions. Each of them brings different talents to the table and appreciates how their strengths and weaknesses balance out.\n \u201cI am not good at a lot of the ancillary business stuff like booking. Jason is a lot better at that,\u201d shares Toporek before Woodbury chimes in.\n  \u201cHonestly, a huge influence on us, both sonically and operationally, is Nick Lowe, Rockpile, and Dave Edmunds; it was all the same guys, but it was presented in different ways. When the set is weighing a little heavier into my tunes, but we might call the show as a JPW show, but with this record, (we) really felt like this was something distinct from our individual projects and the fact that it was the two of us making it made sense that the credit is \u2018co\u2019 on everything. We are co-producing, co-writing, and playing it all, so that\u2019s sort of how it came down.\u201d\n  Together, Woodbury and Toporek have created something that fans of artists like The Shins, Beck, and even a little Dream Syndicate will enjoy. There is a shimmery, summer pop quality to a song like \u201cEverybody\u2019s Talking (Again),\u201d for example, that conjures a collision of dreaminess with the stark reality of life\u2019s more poignant questions. \n  It sparked a cool bit of conversation from its creators.\nWoodbury:\nWe\u2019ve been going back and forth on that one.\nZach\njoked that the song is Christian Rock adjacent. That song is weirdly about church as a young kid, in a certain sense, and Zach had brought up that he felt like it\u2019s about the rapture and everyone is talking about moving away, i.e., going to heaven.\nToporek:\nAnd you are thinking about sticking around so maybe you\u2019re not going to get raptured.\nWoodbury:\nYeah. I think there is truth in that, but I think that the sticking around thing is less about getting left behind. I think what I was trying to say with the song, and sometimes a song presents itself fully formed and is like a full-scale message to yourself from yourself, and when that happens, you are occasionally surprised by the eloquence of what your unknown self is capable of.\n  The idea that deferring the meaning or the value or the promise of life to the \u2018next\u2019 life is unsatisfactory to me. If heaven can exist after we die, then I believe heaven can exist with each other in these little glimpses and little moments. \n  One of the most interesting parts of the song is the ending, which has some super lush vocal harmonies that soar like classic \u201970s radio hits. \n  \u201cGordon Lightfoot was\nthe\ninfluence for all the melodramatic vocalizations toward the end of the song. I thought it was so much fun. I\u2019m not a cut loose kind of guy when it comes to music, but as a collaborator, it was so much fun to get to that point in the song, and it was kind of joyous,\u201d says Toporek.\n  The band delivers a slow-dance classic in \u201cFar Off Road,\u201d and then Toporek lets it all hang out with his lead vocal on the bouncy rocker \u201cFrightening.\u201d This one sparked another enlightening chat.\nToporek:\nI think it started as just a jam. He came up with that bass line, and I ended up going down the rabbit hole and expanding on it a bit. That one is a pretty strong co-write, lyrically, between the two of us. Jason had a couple lines going and I remember doing dishes one day and just thinking where it should go from there and came up with the next verse. \n  Jason came up with one of my favorite lines on there: \u2018I think the map is probably hidden from a certain point of view.\u2019 I kind of just extrapolated that out into trying to feel your way through life blindly, and the frightening thing is, when you look at life, sometimes. \u2018Frightening\u2019 for me is kind of what happens when you kind of peek into the hidden room. What does it cost to look within,\u00a0 and whatever the answer is, it frightened the hell out of me.\nWoodbury:\nI think \u201cFrightening\u201d might have started off with the idea that it was a Dad Weed song. It\u2019s one of my favorite vocals from Zach on the whole record. He just really sings the hell out of that song, and it\u2019s really enjoyable.\nToporek:\nAnd I\u2019m deeply uncomfortable with it, and I can\u2019t stand to hear it.\nOne hand was on the mouse and ready to hit delete, and the other hand was grabbing it and pulling it away. It really took some self-restraint to actually let myself be myself, which is a very strange sentence.\nWoodbury:\nIt is frightening to lean into those supposed or perceived flaws, but we live pathologically in an age when it is very difficult to face things that are very apparent. This record is definitely us reflecting on that and recognizing that the thing that frightens us is the thing that is necessary for us to grapple with, and it just might be the thing that saves us.\nAmassed Like a Rat King\nis a record that has a lot to say, just as Toporek and Woodbury have a lot to say as musicians and two guys making their way in the world today (hello, Mr. Wendt). While it is incredibly thoughtful and in touch with a wide range of emotions, it is also playful, rockin\u2019 and a lot of fun. There is truly a little something for everyone across each and every song. \n  The penultimate track, \u201cSo Brightly There,\u201d is also something of a standout. Like \u201cFar Off Road,\u201d the song provokes the image of a dark room and two figures holding each other closely while immersed in dance.\nclick to enlarge\nJason P. Woodbury performs as JPW in summer 2022.\nNadya Sanchez\nWoodbury:\n\u201cSo Brightly There\u201d is a song I wrote for my wife, Becky (Bartkowski), that she would like, and she is really the one who pushed for Zach and I to collaborate. She said, \u2018You and Zach make a lot of sense as collaborators,\u2019 and she understood that we brought a certain balance to each other on a creative level. \n  It is the one song from the record that we are not going to try and replicate in the live sense just yet. I\u2019ve never been all that great at writing love songs, but there are at least two certified love songs on this record, and I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m slowly but surely upping my quotient for writing love songs on each record.\nToporek:\nI think that the concept for the next record should be songs that our wives might actually like. If we played to their tastes more, I think we might get more people to listen to it. When\nJason\nplayed me \u201cSo Brightly There,\u201d I thought, \u2018Oh, amazing. You did it. Great job.\u2019 We did a couple of little overdubs, but he brought a fully formed, two-minute and seventeen-second pop banger.\n  Woodbury (acoustic guitar) and Toporek (drums), who both sing lead and backing vocals on the record, along with guitarist Rick Hines and bassist Andrew Bates, will be performing most of the songs from\nAmassed Like a Rat King\n, on at the release show this weekend. Do yourself a favor and hit the show, and if you can, grab the awesome record on green vinyl from the band, who will have copies for sale throughout the night.\nJPW + Dad Weed perform at 7 p.m., Saturday, June 14, at The Dirty Drummer in Phoenix.

Dr. Dre donated $10 million toward the construction of the school\u2019s performing arts center, which is in the background.\n(Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\nBy\nHoward Blume\nStaff Writer\nMay 23, 2025\n3 AM PT\nShare via\nEmail\nThreads\nWhatsApp\nCompton has some of the poorest families in the region; it now has the newest, fanciest public high school.\nThe new Compton High also will feature some uncommon learning approaches, including a library without walls or books.\nCompton officials present their once-beleaguered school system as a destination for aspiring scholars.\nStudents from among the poorest families in California are about to get the newest, most up-to-date public high school in the state as the rebuilt Compton High prepares to open.\nThe brand-new $225-million, 31-acre campus is strikingly innovative \u2014 even experimental in some ways: The library has no books; it\u2019s all digital. Classrooms feature an expanse of windows and sliding glass doors. Security measures are high-tech and largely invisible.\nTraditional components of a high school are meant to be top-in-class. Each station in the weight room is outfitted with an iPad so athletes can design and monitor workout plans. Athletic facilities include two baseball fields, a football stadium, a soccer field, multiple basketball and tennis courts, a swimming pool and a large gymnasium.\nAnd for musicians, dancers and drama kids, the performing arts center got a $10-million donation from Compton native Andre \u201cDr. Dre\u201d Young \u2014 commemorated with a massive mural of his face on the building.\nAdvertisement\nThe new campus was showcased to the public Thursday and, in the fall, will welcome students \u2014 who have been roughing it for six years in temporary quarters at a nearby, worn, surplus campus that was formerly a middle school.\nThe campus was paid for with school-construction bonds approved by voters who live within the boundaries of Compton Unified.\nThe new campus replaces a creaky, 1930s-era school with a dignified facade and bell tower. But band director Anthony Ransfer remembers that every item of value inside had to be shifted when it rained because of leaks.\nFormer Compton school board member Charles Davis, who attended Thursday\u2019s ribbon-cutting, said he welcomed the new campus but wished the bell tower had been saved. However, officials opted to raze the old school in its entirety to make room for the new, avoiding costly conservation work.\n\u201cWhile we cherish those memories, we also know sometimes, to move forward, we must make tough choices,\u201d said school board member Satra Zurita. \u201cThe truth is, as much as we loved the old school, it simply wasn\u2019t serving our students the way they deserved.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nUntil Thursday, student MyShay Causey\u2019s only high school experience was at the former middle school.\n\u201cAs someone who\u2019s finally seen the inside, there isn\u2019t much more I could have asked for,\u201d said MyShay, the school\u2019s student representative to the Board of Education. \u201cInstead of squishing together on a tiny stage, we\u2019ll get to shine in our very own theater, and our home sports will actually be at our home.\u201d\nMyShay, a graduating senior, added with a laugh that she was \u201csuper jealous\u201d that she wouldn\u2019t get to attend class here.\nBut, she said, \u201cthis campus is not only a culmination of years of our community\u2019s vision ... it embodies our collective commitment to providing an environment where curiosity is nurtured, creativity is celebrated, and every student is empowered.\u201d\nMyShay and other speakers captured the spirit of the education theory officials said was behind the construction: If you give students the best, they are likely to do better.\nAdvertisement\nA top-notch campus alone does not produce academic achievement \u2014 and, conversely, a brilliant teacher and an assiduous student in a one-room schoolhouse can make for an upstanding education.\nBut the new Compton High is aimed at improving the odds for a student body with few resources \u2014 93% of Compton students qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch because of low family income.\n\u201cThe environment we\u2019ve created here at Compton High School will launch scholars\u2019 potential,\u201d said school board member Ayanna Davis. \u201cThis is more than a campus. It\u2019s a launchpad.\u201d\nIt was lost on no one that this new campus is located in Compton \u2014 both notorious and celebrated as a birthplace of L.A. hip-hop culture.\nDr. Dre, the rapper, producer and music mogul, waited cheerfully through celebratory speeches before making brief remarks.\n\u201cI want to say this in front of everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not my idea for my head to be as big as that on the side of this building. ... But yeah ... I really appreciate it. Now, this is the type of building that I would have loved to go to when I was a kid growing up. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t here, but here it is now.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFor 100 years or more, Compton has been home to the aspiring working class, evolving from a white to a Black and now majority Latino community that still maintains a strong Black presence.\nCompton High\u2019s 1,600-person student body is 84% Latino, 15% Black and 1% Pacific Islander.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something special about growing up here,\u201d Dr. Dre said. \u201cIt\u2019s a certain kind of grit that gets cultivated, navigating these streets, and that grit carried me farther than I could ever imagine.\u201d\nThe school district is putting the world on notice, said Supt. Darin Brawley.\n\u201cThere are some of you ... you didn\u2019t go to school here for high school because you didn\u2019t think our high schools then were good enough to go to,\u201d Brawley told the outdoor audience of more than 300. \u201cFast forward to today, Compton is on the move. We are a shining beacon.\n\u201cThose of you that still talk about how bad Compton schools are, wake up and cease that narrative and start spreading the good word.\u201d\nIn terms of increasing test scores, data support Brawley\u2019s claims. Although there is much work to do, independent researchers have praised the school system of close to 17,000 students for showing\nsignificant, long-term academic improvement\nthat is outpacing growth in California and the nation.\nThe school district has relied heavily on test preparation and test data analysis \u2014 an approach that critics say can stunt deep and broad learning. But the new school also showcases a district learning vision that is more nuanced and nurturing.\nAdvertisement\nJordan Ingram, an 11th-grader, found his motivation in band director Ransfer, who encouraged him to learn multiple musical instruments. Both were glowing as they took in the performing arts center.\nWithout music education, Jordan said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here. I wouldn\u2019t have the goals that I have. I maybe would have flunked out.\u201d\nHe has come to like the satisfaction of solving a math problem, even though it\u2019s hard. He plans to go to college and become a music teacher, though he also might start his own band along the way.\nOver several years, Principal Larry Natividad has ramped up arts programs at the temporary campus so they will be ready to go in the fall.\nNot just new gadgetry\nThe new school has a culinary classroom with professional-grade stoves, ovens and refrigeration.\nAdvertisement\nSwimming coaches won\u2019t have to rely on stopwatches. Sensors in the wall of the pool will record when a swimmer completes a lap or race. The pool\u2019s mechanical room looks like the boiler room of an ocean liner \u2014 with giant tanks that purify pool water and another system that stabilizes the temperature.\nThe weight room is enormous, and there\u2019s an entirely separate fitness room with different equipment. A treatment room has ice machines to feed full-body ice baths.\nThe cafeteria is organized like a small college student union, with a chess-or-checkers table, foosball tables and pingpong.\nClassrooms are set up with long electronic cables suspended from the ceiling \u2014 so power for a computer will never be far away even if chairs and tables are reconfigured.\nThe school also includes learning innovations that may raise eyebrows.\nThe library is meant to be noisy: It\u2019s a lounge-like area with no walls or doors that is bisected by the hallway that traverses the building. And there are no shelves or books \u2014 all volumes are digital.\nClassrooms are organized like high-tech college lecture halls \u2014 no teacher has their own room. Instead, each teacher has a desk and a computer in a separate and small \u201ccollaboration\u201d room.\nAdvertisement\nThe design also incorporates extensive natural light; doors are made of glass and adjacent to other panes of glass.\nThe look is in stark defiance of a proliferating security mentality in schools to stop active shooters. Many schools are \u201chardening the target,\u201d making it impossible to see inside rooms, limiting ground-floor windows, locking entry doors and reinforcing them with steel.\nCompton High is relying instead on a secure campus perimeter, cameras throughout campus and facial recognition technology.\nPrincipal Natividad is thinking big.\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said, recounting a pep talk he had with his students. \u201cWe will have a president of the United States coming from Compton. We will have a Supreme Court justice from the city of Compton. We will have various members in leadership to lead our great country, because we are great, and no one is going to tell us that we are not.\u201d\nMore to Read\nOver 2,000 pounds of meth, cocaine and fentanyl found inside Compton home, feds say\nJune 2, 2025\nBoy dies after shooting at Compton park, shooter remains at large\nMay 9, 2025\nCompton Unified stands out as a national leader in raising student test scores\nFeb. 11, 2025\nCalifornia\nEducation\nArts\nEntertainment Voices\nNewsletter\nSign up for Essential California\nThe most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\nHoward Blume\nFollow Us\nEmail\nHoward Blume covers education for the Los Angeles Times.

Like the National Guard troops, they are prohibited from conducting law enforcement activity such as making arrests unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which permits the president to use the military to end an insurrection or rebellion of federal power.\nThe Marines being activated are with 2nd battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine division, according to US Northern Command. The activation is \u201cintended to provide Task Force 51 with adequate numbers of forces to provide continuous coverage of the area in support of the lead federal agency,\u201d NORTHCOM said in statement, referring to US Army north\u2019s contingency command post.\nCNN\nRelated live story\nAbout 700 Marines being mobilized as California vows to sue Trump administration\nOne of the people familiar with the Marine mobilization said they will be augmenting the guard presence on the ground in LA. Over 2,000 members of the California National Guard have been activated by the president, but only about 300 have been deployed to the streets of LA so far. Those initial 300 people were on a routine National Guard drill weekend when they were mobilized, which is why they were able to arrive so quickly, the person familiar said; it can take up to 72 hours for other guardsmen to be mobilized. The Marines are expected to bolster some of the guard members who have been deployed to LA in the last two days, this person said.\nAnd while the person familiar stressed that the Marines were being deployed only to augment the forces already there, the image of US Marines mobilizing inside the United States will stand in contrast to National Guardsmen who more routinely respond to domestic issues. While some Marines have been assisting in border security at the southern border, one US official said Marines have not been mobilized within the US like they are in California now since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.\nWhile the Marines\u2019 tasks have not been specified publicly, they could include assignments like crowd control or establishing perimeter security. Lawyers within the Defense Department are also still finalizing language around the use-of-force guidelines for the troops being mobilized, but the person familiar said it will likely mirror the military\u2019s standing rules of the use of force.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom described the involvement of Marines as \u201cunwarranted\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe level of escalation is completely unwarranted, uncalled for, and unprecedented \u2014 mobilizing the best in class branch of the U.S. military against its own citizens,\u201d Newsom said in a statement linking to a news story about the Marines mobilizing.\nNewsom disputed the characterization as a \u201cdeployment,\u201d which the governor described as different from mobilization.

In Tiktok and Facebook videos produced by state-owned China Daily, they often denounce the Philippines\u2019 sovereign rights over the West Philippine Sea as \u201cillegal.\u201d That\u2019s just one of their spiels.\nThey seem to be a tag team, one male, one female, and they look like millennials or maybe even younger, Gen Z kids. They speak English fluently, with little trace of a Chinese accent. Both come across as smart and confident, their faces clear and bright.\nWhen \u201cAtin Ito!\u201d set sail into the West Philippine Sea for its second humanitarian mission in May last year, these talking heads went on the offensive, peddling false narratives on the civil society coalition. They\u2019re \u201csecretly\u201d funded by the US and Philippine governments, the two said.\nHow can they mobilize resources and people to launch such a daunting mission? That was the question that puzzled them. Thus they concluded that these activists must have gotten money from America. It\u2019s typical for Chinese propaganda to paint the world using the binary lens of superpower competition: Everyone who stands up to China is a prop or pawn of the US.\nYou can watch their video\nhere\n.\nI wondered if these two talking heads were created by AI or if their scripts were voiced by AI. They lacked the authenticity of native Chinese speakers.\nTo my surprise, a friend who attended the recent Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore sent me photos of this team from China Daily saying they were real and they were there as \u201cjournalists\u201d covering the important defense and security conference.\nAnd how they sprang into action!\u00a0Our forensics researcher Gaby Baizas tells us more about them\nin this story.\nOur top security officials, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and military chief Romeo Brawner Jr., appeared to be their targets. In one video, the China Daily kids tried to do an ambush interview with Brawner, catching up with him as he was leaving the hall. Breathlessly, they asked him to comment on the Philippines\u2019 \u201cprovocations\u201d in the South China Sea. Brawner, with a smile, politely declined.\u00a0Oh! He \u201cdodged\u201d our questions, one said, full of self-righteousness.\nYou can watch\u00a0how the China Daily \u201cjournalists\u201d tried to corner Brawner\nhere\n.\nTeodoro immediately took to social media to call out the Chinese posing as journalists in this\nvideo\nuploaded by the defense department.\u00a0He and Brawner wasted no time in\ndebunking\nChina Daily\u2019s false news.\nTrolling Philippine officials\nAnother Chinese tactic is to troll Philippine officials in international conferences. At the Munich Security Conference last February, a Chinese academic\u00a0 asked a pointed question at Foreign Affairs Secretary\nEnrique Manalo\nabout the supposed promise of the Philippine government to tow away BRP Sierra Madre from Ayungin Shoal. This has been a contentious issue between China and the Philippines with China claiming that the Philippines has reneged on its promise.\nDays after, at the\nChatham House\nin London, where Manalo spoke, a Chinese diplomat, who initially did not identify himself as such, asked the same question.\nTeodoro\nexperienced this kind of trolling at the Shangri-La Dialogue. He was asked by a People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) officer why the \u00a0Philippines could not manage its maritime dispute with China the way Malaysia and Vietnam do. Apparently, he was referring to the Philippines\u2019 transparency policy of making China\u2019s aggression in the West Philippine Sea public. We\u2019re the only South China Sea claimant country doing this.\nAnother PLA officer asked Teodoro about a potential \u201cproxy war\u201d in the region because of the US setting up military bases in the Philippines. This was not accurate, though. He was referring to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement or EDCA sites, Philippine bases which the American military has access to.\nIn his reply, a miffed Teodoro described the PLA officers\u2019 questions as\n\u201cpropaganda disguised as questions.\u201d\n\u2018Red Guards\u2019 of propaganda\nThe recent encounter of Teodoro and Brawner with the China Daily tag team showed something new, though: an in-your-face confrontation, with \u201cpretend journalists\u201d (Teodoro\u2019s term) asking questions from Philippine officials in an aggressive manner and putting them in a bad light.\nWhile the\nPhilippines\nhas been a victim of massive disinformation\u00a0\u00a0from China \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 this new\u00a0tactic seems to have made its debut at the Shangri-La Dialogue.\nSomehow, the zeal of the two young Chinese reminds me of Mao Tse Tung\u2019s\u201d Red Guards\u201d\u2014 but in the propaganda and disinformation sphere. They march to the same drumbeat, delivering the message that the South China Sea is their lake. They show their might in the information space the way their Coast Guard, PLA Navy and maritime militia do so in the seas.\nThey are bringing the propaganda war face-to-face, but it will not be easy for them in the Philippines. Apart from the anti-China sentiment here, because of their aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea, they have found a formidable opponent in our defense secretary.\nLet me know what you think.

This dual nature can make 3D printing waste-free.\nby\nRupendra Brahambhatt\nJune 9, 2025\nin\nEnvironmental Issues\n,\nFuture\n,\nNews\nA\nA\nEdited and reviewed by\nTibi Puiu\nFrom customized hearing aids to complex dental implants, 3D printing has transformed how we make finely detailed products. However, there is a major problem with this promising technology that is rarely discussed.\nDuring 3D printing, to keep the printed object stable, temporary support structures are fabricated along with the final product. Made from the same material as the product, these supports must be manually removed after printing. This process is time-consuming, delicate, and generates a lot of waste that can\u2019t be reused.\nFor quite some time, scientists have been scratching their heads to solve this problem. Finally, a new study from MIT researchers proposes a practical solution that could dramatically reduce the time, effort, and\nwaste involved in 3D printing\n.\nThe study reveals a peculiar light-sensitive resin that can easily solidify and dissolve whenever required, making it easy to remove the supports and recycle them for future use. Here is how the MIT team developed this material.\nCracking the problem of waste in 3D printing\nIn one version of 3D printing, a model is built layer by layer using light to harden a liquid resin, this process is called vat photopolymerisation. However, once the conventional resin hardens, it stays solid and can only be removed by manually chipping it away.\nTo tackle this, MIT researchers developed a resin that behaves differently under two kinds of light. The team started by mixing two readily available chemicals (IBOA and EPOX), called monomers, which are building blocks of plastics.\nWhen this mixture is exposed to UV light, the monomers form tight chemical bonds, producing a hard, durable solid. However, when the same resin is exposed to visible light (like from an ordinary LED), it forms a softer solid with loosely connected strands.\nRelated\nPosts\nScientists learn how bone grows atom by atom, which could lead to better osteoporosis treatment\n3-D printed electronic egg could help save vultures\nThree dimensional printing goes metal: University of Twente researchers print copper and gold\nFuturistic Contact Lens Delivers Medication Directly to Your Eye\nThis soft solid can easily dissolve in gentle solvents, including baby oil or even the original liquid resin itself. Initially, when they tested this resin in a small lab setup, it worked as planned: one material became tough and the other, dissolvable.\nHowever, when they tested it in a\nreal 3D printer\nusing dimmer LEDs, the hard parts weren\u2019t holding up; they were falling apart in solution. To fix this issue, the team added a third ingredient, a special \u201cbridging monomer\u201d (3,4\u2011epoxycyclohexylmethyl acrylate, aka ECHA) that helped link everything tightly when UV light was used, creating a sturdy final product.\nUsing the modified resin, the researchers could now print both the main object and its supports at the same time using different light patterns. Once the printing was done, they simply dipped the structure into a solution that dissolved the supports; no clipping or breaking was required. Even better, the dissolved material could be recycled into fresh resin for the next print job.\nThey named their approach selective solubility vat photopolymerization (SSVP) and employed it to 3D print complex shapes like gear trains, lattices, and even a small dinosaur inside an egg \u2014 the kind of design that would be nearly impossible to create in a waste-free manner using traditional methods.\n\u201cThis shows we can print multipart assemblies with a lot of moving parts, and detailed, personalized products like hearing aids and dental implants, in a way that\u2019s fast and sustainable,\u201d Nicholas Diaco, lead researcher and a PhD candidate at MIT,\nsaid\n.\nA step towards making 3D printing sustainable\nWhile\n3D printing\nis often better than conventional fabrication and construction methods, it is not entirely an eco-friendly technology. For instance, a report suggests that\n33 percent\nof all 3D printed structures (supports) form waste, and most of them end up in landfills, causing harm to the environment.\n\u201cFor the most part, these supports end up generating a lot of waste,\u201d Diaco said.\nMoreover, traditional methods, like Filament-based 3D printing, which is a popular\n3D printing approach\nin the UK and many other countries, generate thousands of kilograms of plastic waste each year.\nThe newly developed resin opens the door to faster, cleaner, and more efficient 3D printing technology. By eliminating the need to manually remove supports and reducing material waste, the process could become more scalable and eco-friendly.\nThe next step would be to test SSVP with a wider variety of materials, especially ones that are strong enough for industrial or long-term use. The researchers also plan to develop other resins with similar dual behavior and work on automating the recycling of the waste so that the entire system becomes self-sustaining.\nThe\nstudy\nis published in the journal\nAdvanced Materials Technologies\n.\nTags:\n3d printing\nresin\nRupendra Brahambhatt\nRupendra Brahambhatt is an experienced journalist and filmmaker covering culture, science, and entertainment news for the past five years.

Please let us know if you have\nfeedback\n.\nDive Brief:\nMore than 7 in 10 consumers\nsay they use generative AI tools regularly, according to an Accenture\nsurvey of\n18,000 people\nin\n14 countries\nreleased last week\n. Half of these users have already used the technology to inform a purchasing decision.\nAnother\n18% of active generative AI users said the technology was their preferred source for purchase recommendations\n.\nGenerative AI was the second most common source, topped only by physical stores at 19%.\nThree-quarters of users say they are open to using a trusted AI-powered personal shopper that understands their needs.\nJust 9%\u00a0of\nconsumers say generative AI is already their single most trusted source for deciding what to buy.\nDive Insight:\nGenerative AI is reimaging the digital shopping experience by making the product search experience conversational.\nA traditional search engine can\u2019t offer fashion advice, according to\nJill Standish, senior managing director and global lead of retail at Accenture.\nCustomers type in specific search queries and see results that directly match what they entered.\nSearch tools or chatbots powered by generative AI, in contrast, can talk back. A customer can start by mentioning they have a July wedding, and the technology can ask about age, themes and preferred styles to narrow down the results.\n\u201cWe're moving from a product search era to a recommendation era,\u201d Standish told CX Dive. \u201cIt used to be you could search for a brand or a product, or you could search for a price. But could you ask for advice?\u201d\nOne advantage of a generative AI experience is that it can reduce the impact of price on purchasing decisions. Accenture\u2019s research found that consumers are\n1.7 times more likely to accept a higher price point from a brand that delivers emotionally engaging experiences,\nand AI can facilitate those experiences.\nWhile the potential varies by category, making a journey conversational can generate a certain level of emotional attachment between the customer and the product, according to Standish.\n\u201cIt's giving you advice, and if that advice is \u2018here's a healthier option for your dinner\u2019 or \u2018here's the dress you should wear,\u2019 you're almost emotionally attached to the answer, and so you're not necessarily searching on price,\u201d Standish said.\nHowever, the benefits of generative AI are predicated on trust. While many consumers are already familiar with the technology, brands can benefit from putting in the effort to onboard reluctant consumers or those unfamiliar with the technology.\nTransparency is at the core\nof trust building exercises, according to\nBrett Leary, generative AI transformation and global retail lead at Accenture\n. Brands should let customers know when they interact with AI, and inform them that the results can sometimes be wrong, even as brands\nintroduce guardrails\nto minimize the problem.\n\u201cWe do believe that brands should help with the onboarding process to those new customers that are engaging with the tools for the first time,\u201d Leary told CX Dive. \u201cAnd there's different tactics in terms of showing examples of how to talk to it, or here's what the output could look like, or here's some things that you could ask.\u201d\npurchase licensing rights\nFiled Under:\nAI & Automation,\nTechnology\nCX Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nEditors' picks\nDeep Dive\nHow third-party conversational AI could upend customer service\nExperts expect conversational assistants to take on the burden of making customer service queries for customers, but this creates new challenges for CX leaders.\nBy Bryan Wassel \u2022\nApril 14, 2025\nTariffs alarm consumers.

Throughout the 2024 campaign cycle he repeatedly floated the idea of deploying soldiers against protesters. When he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, he daydreamed on\nTruth Social\nabout his desire to bring in \u201cmilitary assets\u201d to help with his mass deportation agenda.\nHe signed an executive order soon after his return to the White House that expanded the use of the military within U.S. borders, just one component of his early actions to push ICE to more swiftly round up and deport migrants \u2014 both those with legal status and undocumented immigrants. That came under the guise of a crackdown on supposedly violent gang members who entered the U.S. illegally, a blanket justification that has, of course, resulted in innocent people getting nabbed off the street daily for the past three months.\nWhen he issued the order over the weekend, purporting to federalize the California National Guard and directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy 2,000 troops to Los Angeles, it was the culmination of this vision he\u2019s held onto for years: bringing in the military to create a grand spectacle of immigration enforcement.\nBut there\u2019s another Trump II agenda item the deployment ticks off by undermining the authority of California state officials and local officials in LA to determine when and how they might request backup in the face of unrest. The Trump administration has been searching for ways to punish blue cities and blue states since before he returned to office. Back in November,\nthe Washington Post reported\nthat Trump and his advisers were discussing how the then-president elect might strip federal funding from Chicago and other blue cities as punishment for getting in the way of his planned deportation program.\nOne of the\nfirst actions\ntaken by the new Trump Justice Department after the President was sworn in in January sought to warn local and state officials against protesting the new administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. In the memo, then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove warned that state and local officials who don\u2019t cooperate with Trump\u2019s deportation efforts could face federal prosecution.\nIn late April, the administration sought to make good on that early scheme to strip funds from sanctuary cities when he signed an\nexecutive order\ndirecting Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Homeland Security Krisi Noem to pull together a list of \u201cStates and local jurisdictions that obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws (sanctuary jurisdictions).\u201d In the order, Trump also directed his OMB Director Russ Vought to \u201cidentify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.\u201d\nThat list of supposed sanctuary cities was published last week, only to be taken down days later\ndue to backlash\n\u2014 the administration had cast an overbroad net and included many municipalities that were not, in fact, sanctuary cities, angering local officials.\nThose are just some of the recent actions the administration has taken to punish state and local municipalities that refuse to cooperate with any one element of Trump\u2019s outrageous and sweeping deportation mandates. The effort, months back, to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams was\nreportedly couched in a scheme\nto force Adams to allow ICE to roam free in protected spaces across the city.\nEven Trump\u2019s allies in Congress have taken Trump\u2019s threats against blue cities into their own hands, as Republicans on the House Oversight Committee drag in blue city mayors to testify under oath about their cities\u2019 sanctuary policies, part of a\nmessaging effort\nto turn the public against an attempt to make communities safe for migrants seeking asylum or working toward other forms of legal status.\nCalifornia in particular has been in the Trump administration\u2019s crosshairs. On Friday, before the decision to federalize the state\u2019s national guard was made,\nCNN reported\nthat the Trump administration had been preparing to announce a sweeping cancelation of federal funding for the state over a litany of perceived crimes such as allowing a trans athletes to participate in a sporting event and having a governor whom Trump dislikes.\nThe events over the weekend simply gave the President an opening to take another swipe at the blue state, and make a spectacle out of its largest blue city.\nGet WTS In Your Inbox\nMost of you are reading Where Things Stand from TPM\u2019s homepage.

The package includes a small portion of the billions in federal funding that Elon Musk either canceled or rescinded in the last few months of DOGE\u2019s rampage through the executive branch, plus a few other Republican pet projects, like cutting PBS and NPR off from federal funds.\nSome whispers of resistance to the idea have surfaced in recent days, as some Republicans in the House facing tough reelection prospects raise issue with the\nsweeping foreign aid\ncuts outlined in the package. And at least one Republican is going to bat for public broadcasting.\nPer The Hill\n:\nRep.\u00a0Mark Amodei\u00a0(R-Nev.) on Monday urged the Trump administration to reconsider a request to Congress for public broadcasting cuts, warning of the potential impact some local communities face if funding is yanked back.\nIn a joint statement, Amodei and Rep.\u00a0Dan Goldman\u00a0(D-N.Y.), co-chairs of the Public Broadcasting Caucus, defended public broadcasting funding, saying local stations\u2019 ability to \u201ccontinue offering free, high-quality programming would be eliminated if the federal funding is rescinded.\u201d\nFinance Dems Call For Public Markup Hearing\nSenate Finance Committee Democrats sent a letter to Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) on Friday demanding he schedule a public markup \u201cso that the members may serve their role in considering\u201d the committee\u2019s portion of the reconciliation bill before it moves to the Senate floor.\nThe Finance Committee is in charge of the part of the text that is\ncausing the most tension among Senate Republicans\n, including cuts to Medicaid, the clean energy tax credits and other key tax breaks.\n\u201cIf Trump and Republicans in Congress are going to deprive millions of Americans of their health care so that millionaires and rich corporations can get massive tax cuts, it should not be done in secret backroom negotiations. It should be done in the light of day, including through a full markup in the Senate Finance Committee,\u201d Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote in the letter.\nThe letter comes amid questions around if Senate Republicans will hold traditional, open-to-the-public markup hearings or skip markups altogether and bring the revised version of the reconciliation package straight to the floor.\n\u201cMy opinion is the reason they haven\u2019t wanted a markup is because they know that they\u2019ll walk into the committee and try to defend the indefensible,\u201d Wyden told reporters on Wednesday, just two days before the letter was sent. \u201cAnd the American people are going to be furious.\u201d\n\u201cTheir positions on Medicaid are indefensible, their positions on clean energy tax incentives, which I wrote, are indefensible,\u201d the Oregon Democrat added. \u201cThese kinds of issues are going to be what they\u2019ll have to deal with in an open markup, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing such somersaults to do other things.\u201d\n\u2014 Emine Y\u00fccel\nIn Case You Missed It\nTrump Has Long Been Itching To Use The Military On American Streets\nCatch up on TPM live coverage here:\nTrump Admin Calls In National Guard Against LA Protestors\nFrom TPM Cafe:\nLos Angeles Guard Deployment Raises Specter Of Kent State\nYesterday\u2019s Most Read Story\nMore Thoughts on the Unfolding Crisis in CA\nWhat We Are Reading\nSly Stone, Maestro of a Multifaceted, Hitmaking Band, Dies at 82\nGuide to Invocations of the Insurrection Act\nThe National Guard in Los Angeles\nStart your day with TPM.\nSign up for the Morning Memo newsletter\nNicole Lafond\nis TPM\u2019s deputy editor, based in New York.

Discovery to Split Into Two Companies\nWarner Bros. Discovery\n, grappling with declines in its overall business, said Monday it planned to divide the company into two publicly-traded entities, one devoted to streaming and content production and one devoted to traditional television.\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO\nDavid Zaslav\nwill remain as the leader of the streaming-focused entity, while\nGunnar Wiedenfels\n, the company\u2019s CFO who has become known for finding new ways to cut old costs, will lead the TV company. The separation is expected to be completed by mid-2026, subject to closing and other conditions, and the bulk of the current company\u2019s debt \u2014 nearly $38 billion \u2013will be assigned to the TV entity.\nRelated Stories\n\u2018Nine Perfect Strangers\u2019 Returns: Here\u2019s How to Watch Season 2 Online for Free\nAlexis Bledel Withdraws From Emmy Race for 'The Handmaid's Tale' Due to New Guest Actor Rules (EXCLUSIVE)\n\u201cBy operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today\u2019s evolving media landscape,\u201d Zaslav said in a statement.\nPopular on Variety\nThe company is emulating a strategy recently put into place by rival Comcast. That conglomerate is breaking up NBCUniversal, with plans to place the bulk of its cable networks in\na new publicly-traded spinoff called Versant\nwhile keeping its broadcast and streaming assets under the better-known entity, NBC.\nSEE ALSO:\nWBD Split: Breakdown of Which Businesses Will End Up in Each Company\nWarner has had to contend with many obstacles\nsince being formed by the combination of AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia \u2014 the company once known as Time Warner \u2014 and the former Discovery Communications, Under Zaslav, Warner has fiddled with streaming strategies and deprived top cable networks of TNT and TBS of the original content they need to flourish.\nWarner recently lost long-held rights to televise NBA games\n, a contract that gave its networks a major sporting franchise that drew large crowds on the regular. And it has written down the value of its cable properties.\nWarner has recently appeared to find some rhythm. The Max service has developed solid audiences for programs including \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus,\u201d and the company has recently articulated a strategy of targeting audiences interested in premium content, rather than a broader crowd. And Warner has struck new distribution deals with cable and satellite companies that call for what are seen internally as favorable terms, despite the loss of the NBA.\nThe streaming company will encompass the Warner TV and movie studios, HBO and HBO Max and a games and experiences division. The company will focus on building out the HBO Max streaming service and investing in programming. Meanwhile, the TV company will include Warner\u2019s TV networks around the world along with specific digital brands tied to the TV entities, including Discovery+, Bleacher Report and CNN\u2019s new streaming products.\nWarner\u2019s move is likely to spur new speculation about potential consolidation in the media sector. Part of the strategy behind Comcast\u2019s Versant is its ability to do deals. Paramount Global, owner of CBS, is also under financial pressure and may have to consider new rounds of cost cutting if it cannot consummate a deal it has in place to be acquired by Skydance Media.\nDuring an investor call Monday, executives suggested the two companies might continue to be aligned. Ad sales may represent both sides of the split, executives said, and sports, while being placed with the TV company, will likely continue to stream on HBO Max for the foreseeable future, though those plans could change as the two companies plot their own strategies in the future. \u201cThe U.S. sports rights will reside at the global networks, and its management team will determine how best to monetize the streaming and digital rights over time,\u201d Wiedenfels said.\nJump to Comments\nMore from Variety\nJon Bernthal and Ebon Moss-Bachrach to Star in \u2018Dog Day Afternoon\u2019 on Broadway\nGeorge Clooney\u2019s \u2018Good Night, and Good Luck\u2019 Recoups $9.5 Million Broadway Investment\n\u2018Glengarry Glen Ross,\u2019 Starring Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr, Recoups $7.5 Million Investment on Broadway\nTom Felton to Reprise Draco Malfoy Role in \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\u2019 on Broadway\nWhere to Buy Tickets For Broadway\u2019s Biggest Tony Winners: \u2018Sunset Boulevard,\u2019 \u2018Oh, Mary,\u2019 \u2018Purpose\u2019 and More\nWill Ferrell\u2019s \u2018Eurovision\u2019 Movie Becoming Broadway Musical\nLoading comments...\nMore From Our Brands\nRolling Stone\nQuestlove Honors \u2018Giant\u2019 Sly Stone: \u2018His Music Will Echo Forever\u2019\nRobb Report\nThis $24 Million Boston Home Doubles as an Art Gallery\nSportico\nPenn State, UCLA Deny Deals With Elevate\u2019s New College Sports\u00a0Fund\nWWD\nBalmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing Talks About His Museum at FIT Honor, How He Unwinds and What He Hopes to Impart to FIT\u00a0Students\nTVLine\nSave the Dates: Love Island Spinoff, Magic City Docuseries and More\nad", "ped_digest": "P:Warner Bros.

They have everything here, including \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 kitchen sinks.\n\u201cUnderstanding that a lot of these materials have a lot of historic value, a lot of memories soaked into these materials,\u201d Hightower says. \u201cWe did want to dedicate and give those back to the community, as opposed to destroying them or sending them to the landfill as waste.\u201d\nAnd they're available for free to the people who live in this area, like Maurice Spencer.\n\u201cThey had all kinds of refrigerators, stoves, heating systems, condensers, anything that a house would take to survive,\u201d he says.\nMaurice lives a couple of blocks away from the homes where these items came from. He was one of the first in line when the salvage center opened June 2. He snagged a condenser and a water heater.\n\u201cThe one I had started leaking,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was right on time.\u201d\nResidents, businesses and community groups can shop for what they need. They even have free delivery.\n\u201cWe have a community organization here that is looking to build an amphitheater in a former park,\u201d Hightower says. \u201cThey would like the marble steps to use as benches. Projects like that are certainly things we want to hear more about and certainly things that we are open to see how we can help.\u201d\nAnd not everything is old.\nThey have stainless steel appliances, high-end doors and cabinets, and some furnishings like this bathroom vanity Hightower dusted off.\n\u201cFirst day they found this very unique, looks like a bathroom sink,\u201d she says. \u201cI don't think you can find this anywhere. It's made of very quality material. This may be a marble top on this. But this is just an example.\u201d\nMaurice says he'll be back.\n\u201cI saw some doors in there that I really like,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have wood bannisters, doors, windows. If anyone interested in doing a little work to your home, this would be the place to start looking for something if you don\u2019t have the money to purchase the things.\u201d\nTo shop here, you must live in the Midtown Edmondson or Greater Rosemont neighborhoods, and they are verifying that your address is within these zones.\nIt\u2019s open Monday through Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and by appointment on Saturdays.\nThe address is 2150 Harlem Avenue.\nCopyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc.

CherryTree Inc., recognized for its unique custom PCs, has provided\nGamers Nexus\nwith the GeeFarce 5027 POS, a contender that could rival the\nbest graphics cards\navailable today, or not.\nThere are several options for disposing of a damaged graphics card. You could reuse it as a paperweight or doorstop, or simply throw it in the dumpster; however, that isn't the most responsible action, as it contributes to e-waste. Instead, CherryTree had the innovative idea of repurposing a graphics card into a fully functional system. The Gigabyte graphics card is a few generations old, as indicated by the cooler design, which was previously used with the manufacturer's\nGeForce RTX 20-series\n(codenamed Turing) graphics cards released approximately six years ago.\nWhen the shroud was removed, it became apparent that CherryTree had integrated a\nNUC\ninto the GeeFarce 5027 POS. Although not the most recent model, the Asus NUC 13 Pro still has decent specifications. It's equipped with the Core i7-1360P chip (codenamed Raptor Lake), which wields 12 cores and 16 threads with a boost clock speed up to 5 GHz on the P-cores. It also has integrated Iris Xe graphics, with 96 EUs up to 1.5 GHz. CherryTree paired the 28W Raptor Lake processor with 64GB of DDR4-3200 SO-DIMM memory and a 2TB MP33 PCIe 3.0 SSD, both sourced from TeamGroup.\nCherryTree only partially took advantage of the Gigabyte cooling system. Given the size of the NUC, the heatsink remained unused, whereas the triple cooling fans actually helped with active cooling of the NUC's components. You can install the GeeFarce 5027 POS into a standard expansion slot, effectively having a PC within your PC. However, the PCIe interface on the graphics card is non-functional. CherryTree converted the 8-pin PCIe power connector into a barrel connector, so the GeeFarce 5027 POS gets its power through an adapter from the wall outlet. Additionally, the outlet has hardwired a power button onto the side of the graphics card.\nThe NUC 13 Pro is placed close to the graphics card's I/O bracket. Therefore, you get access to the ports even if the GeeFarce 5027 POS is installed in a PC. The connectivity is the same as what you get from a NUC 13 Pro, so two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, one USB 2.0 Type-A port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, and a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port from the Intel I226-V controller.\nAs weak as the Iris Xe iGPU may be, the GeeFarce 5027 POS could run a few games. According to tests, games like\nDoom\n,\nDoom II\n, and\nQuantum Break\nran fine on the device. Gamers Nexus performed synthetic tests on the GeeFarce 5027 POS, and unsurprisingly, the Iris Xe could not catch a\nGeForce RTX 2070 Super\n. Power consumption was within expectations, peaking at around 87W. P-core, E-core, and graphics cores peaked at 75 degrees Celsius, 70 degrees Celsius, and 60 degrees Celsius, respectively.\nThe GeeFarce 5027 POS is, unfortunately, just a fun project for CherryTree and is unavailable on the company's e-store.\nFollow\nTom's Hardware on Google News\nto get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Her burial spoke of a community steeped in fear, eager to prevent what they saw as an evil resurrection. Known now as \u201cZosia,\u201d she was one of several \u201cvampire\u201d burials from the time, each steeped in a potent mix of local lore and superstition.\nZosia was never supposed to come back from the dead. The 17th-century Polish villagers who oversaw her burial made certain of it \u2014 or so they thought.\nToday, science has brought Zosia\u2019s story back to life. Researchers from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Poland, along with Swedish archaeologist Oscar Nilsson, have used DNA, 3D printing, and modeling clay to reconstruct her face, bringing a measure of dignity to a woman once reviled as an evil threat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really ironic,\u201d Nilsson told\nReuters\n. \u201cThese people burying her . . . did everything they could in order to prevent her from coming back from the dead . . . we have done everything we can in order to bring her back to life.\u201d\nMeet Zosia\nZosia, researchers estimate, was just 18 to 20 years old when she died. At the time she was laid to rest in the 17th century, her village in Pie\u0144, like many in Europe, was gripped by anxiety about plague, famine, and war. Such conditions were fertile ground for the supernatural. Villagers sought out scapegoats in people who were not like the rest; often those suffering from mental illness (not recognized as a thing back then) and peculiar traits.\nIn Zosia\u2019s case, skeletal abnormalities in her sternum and skull, revealed through scans, suggest she may have lived in visible discomfort. And Nilsson suspects that symptoms like fainting spells and severe headaches \u2014 illnesses poorly understood at the time \u2014 may have added to the suspicions that branded her a \u201cvampire.\u201d\nThe grave itself is like something from some horror movie: an iron sickle poised at her neck as though ready to decapitate her if she dared rise again, while a padlock clamped her foot, binding her spirit in place. Archaeologists explained that such measures were believed to \u201clock\u201d the soul of anyone who might be \u201cdangerous.\u201d Pie\u0144\u2019s villagers apparently hoped these barriers would protect the living, just in case Zosia\u2019s death wasn\u2019t quite as final as they\u2019d wished.\nRelated\nPosts\nThis Warrior Was Buried in Ice Under a Bone Shield for 4,000 Years and His Face Was Just Reconstructed\nVirtual reconstruction shows what the first modern humans to reach Europe looked like\nSo-called vampire found in mass grave\nAncient \u2018vampires\u2019 found in Bulgaria\n\u201cDangerous people were thought to have two different souls, a good one and a bad one,\u201d Nilsson explained in . In this view, the padlock\u2019s power held the \u201cgood soul\u201d in check, while the sickle was ready to deter the \u201cbad soul\u201d\u2014the part of Zosia that, in local folklore, could emerge as a malevolent \u201cstriga,\u201d or vampire.\nReconstructing a Face, Restoring Humanity\nIn August 2022, researchers from Nicolaus Copernicus University discovered Zosia\u2019s skeletal remains, along with those of a young child buried face down (perhaps another \u201cvampire\u201d). Unlike Zosia, who was buried with items hinting at a noble background \u2014 a silk headdress interwoven with gold or silver \u2014 the other graves bore only simple markers. Yet, each bore a trace of superstition and fear, signs of a community caught between science and magic.\nTo bring Zosia back to life, Nilsson started with a digital model of her skull, then 3D-printed it as a foundation for clay. Each layer was carefully sculpted to match what her bone structure and age suggested. With precision, Nilsson recreated her facial muscles, restoring her features and a human identity obscured by years of myth and legend. The final result is startlingly vivid \u2014 a face that, for all its centuries of separation, feels unexpectedly familiar.\nFor Nilsson, watching her face take shape was an amazing feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional to watch a face coming back from the dead,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially when you know the story about this young girl.\u201d The process, he added, was \u201cabout bringing Zosia back as a human, and not as this monster she is buried as.\u201d\nThe young woman who was once entombed under layers of folklore now stares back at viewers with unmistakable humanity. She reminds us of the thin line between fear and compassion \u2014 and what terrible things can happen when that line is crossed in the wrong way.\n\u201cI\u2019m used to reconstructing faces,\u201d he added, \u201cbut in this case, also, I\u2019m looking forward to giving her some human dignity back.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared in November 2024 and was updated with new information\n.\nTags:\nReconstruction\nvampire\nTibi Puiu\nTibi is a science journalist and co-founder of ZME Science.

Yet on his first trip back to the ballpark where he spent 11 seasons, Francona finds himself balancing both his competitive drive and the emotional connections that made his time here so meaningful.\nMore Guardians coverage\nGuardians injury updates on Andrew Walters, Will Brennan, Juan Brito and more\nCleveland Guardians, Cincinnati Reds starting lineups for June 9, 2025: Game 65\nGuardians activate veteran outfielder; option infielder to Triple-A Columbus\nHow to watch the Guardians:\nSee how to watch Guardians games with\nthis handy game-by-game TV schedule.\n\u201cI had 11 really fun years here, and I had some great relationships \u2014 that never changes,\u201d Francona said before his Cincinnati Reds faced his former team on Monday. \u201cBut now we\u2019re trying to figure out a way to beat them tonight. That\u2019s kind of why we\u2019re here. They\u2019ll never take away how I feel about people here.\u201d\nThe ballpark looks different to Francona after renovations, particularly the clubhouse areas. \u201cIt\u2019s really different,\u201d he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen the whole thing yet just because I don\u2019t feel like icing down my knees (after the long walk between clubhouses). But there\u2019s a lot (different). It\u2019s nice.\u201d\nWhen Francona left Cleveland, he seemed adamant his managing days were over because of health concerns that affected his ability to perform the job to his standards.\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t believe me, but I was not planning on doing this again,\u201d Francona explained. \u201cI went home. I didn\u2019t think I was doing my job the way you\u2019re supposed to. I think a lot of that was health.\u201d\nThe physical toll had started to affect other aspects of how he managed games. \u201cWhen you start not feeling great physically, then all of a sudden you start getting short on patience,\u201d Francona said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to have conversations with players that I thought were necessary all the time. It was just getting harder. I felt like I was letting people down.\u201d\nFrancona says enjoyed his year away from the game, watching more baseball as a fan than he had in years. He deliberately maintained distance from Cleveland\u2019s organization to give Stephen Vogt and his staff space. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was right,\u201d he said of potentially visiting. \u201cThey needed to be able to do things. They don\u2019t need me telling them how to do it or acting like I\u2019m going to tell them how to do it.\u201d\nHis return to managing came unexpectedly when Cincinnati executives Nick Krall and Brad Meador visited him at home.\n\u201cI literally talked to them in my rocking chair,\u201d Francona recalled. \u201cIt just felt a lot like the Cleveland guys (Chris Antonetti and Mike Chernoff). And at this point in my life and my career, going through stuff with people that I really respect and care about is probably more important than what our payroll is.\u201d\nThose connections resonate deeply with Francona, who treasures the relationships he has built throughout the game. He admitted that getting a text message from one of the longtime Cleveland clubhouse attendants late Sunday made his whole day.\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s baseball,\u201d he said. \u201cThat stuff never changes. And the people in the game make it really special.\u201d\nWhen asked about his expectations about the reception he will receive from fans, Francona dismissed the question with his trademark dry humor: \u201cHalf of \u2018em probably want (to give) their t-shirts back, the ones they gave out. I mean, I\u2019m on a different team, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spent two seconds thinking about stuff like that.\u201d\nFrancona admits he doesn\u2019t have the same energy level as earlier in his career, but he believes he can succeed with the Reds.\n\u201cI think I can do the job,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to shortchange anybody. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to anybody.\u201d\nDespite now wearing Cincinnati\u2019s colors, Francona maintains connections with players like Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez. \u201cI always send notes to Hosey through (Guardians interpreter Agustin Rivero), probably about once a month,\u201d he revealed. \u201cI sent him a bunch last year. So in a weird way, I have kept up with him.\u201d\nFrancona says he has always appreciated Ram\u00edrez\u2019s development and playing style, having had a front row seat from the time the Dominican slugger first reached the majors.\n\u201cThis kid made himself into one of the best players in the game,\u201d Francona noted, emphasizing his appreciation was not just about Ram\u00edrez\u2019s impressive statistics, but also his approach to the game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way he plays, and he\u2019s always done that,\u201d Francona said. \u201cAs the game slows down for you, you don\u2019t have to slow down.\u201d\nGenerative AI was used to organize and draft this story.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Terry Francona's return to Cleveland as an opposing manager|Francona balancing competitive drive and emotional connections|Francona enjoyed a year away from the game|Francona's return was unexpected|Connections with people are important to Francona|Francona maintains connections with players like Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez;E:Francona's first trip back to Cleveland since leaving|Cincinnati Reds facing his former team|Francona visited by Cincinnati executives Nick Krall and Brad Meador|Francona sending notes to Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez|Renovations to Cleveland's ballpark|Francona retiring after the 2023 season;D:Published: Jun. 09, 2025, 5:29 p.m.|Updated: Jun. 09, 2025, 6:24 p.m.|Summer Sale - Expires 6/30/25|11 seasons in Cleveland|Francona's age affecting his energy level|Guardians activate veteran outfielder|option infielder to Triple-A Columbus;", "er_digest": "N:Chris Antonetti|Andrew Walters|Stephen Vogt|Brad Meador|Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez|Mike Chernoff|Nick Krall|Agustin Rivero|Will Brennan|Terry Francona|Juan Brito;R:Dominican Republic|Ohio|Cleveland|Cincinnati;", "gist": "P:Terry Francona's return to Cleveland as an opposing manager|Francona balancing competitive drive and emotional connections|Francona enjoyed a year away from the game|Francona's return was unexpected|Connections with people are important to Francona|Francona maintains connections with players like Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez;E:Francona's first trip back to Cleveland since leaving|Cincinnati Reds facing his former team|Francona visited by Cincinnati executives Nick Krall and Brad Meador|Francona sending notes to Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez|Renovations to Cleveland's ballpark|Francona retiring after the 2023 season;D:Published: Jun. 09, 2025, 5:29 p.m.|Updated: Jun. 09, 2025, 6:24 p.m.|Summer Sale - Expires 6/30/25|11 seasons in Cleveland|Francona's age affecting his energy level|Guardians activate veteran outfielder|option infielder to Triple-A Columbus;N:Chris Antonetti|Andrew Walters|Stephen Vogt|Brad Meador|Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez|Mike Chernoff|Nick Krall|Agustin Rivero|Will Brennan|Terry Francona|Juan Brito;R:Dominican Republic|Ohio|Cleveland|Cincinnati;", "entities": ["Chris Antonetti", "Andrew Walters", "Stephen Vogt", "Brad Meador", "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez", "Mike Chernoff", "Nick Krall", "Agustin Rivero", "Will Brennan", "Terry Francona", "Juan Brito"], "regions": ["Dominican Republic", "Ohio", "Cleveland", "Cincinnati"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/tv/2025/06/tyler-perrys-divorced-sistas-premieres-live-on-bet-today-how-to-watch-for-free.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\nTyler Perry\u2019s \u2018Divorced Sistas\u2019 BET premiere: How to watch for free today\nUpdated: Jun. 09, 2025, 5:05 p.m.\n|\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 5:05 p.m.\nBy\nAbby L'Bert, cleveland.com\nA new Tyler Perry original called \u201c\nDivorced Sistas\n\u201d premieres live on BET today, Monday, June 9, directly after the 2025 BET Awards.

Eric Thomas\nDear Eric:\nI\u2019m a sophomore in high school and I read your column in the Seattle Times. My grandma has dementia. Over the past year, we\u2019ve noticed more and more signs and convinced her to move into a nursing home a few months ago because we can\u2019t provide the constant care she needs.\nShe\u2019s at a more advanced stage now and can\u2019t walk or feed herself, and she forgets who we are sometimes, which is hard for all of us. I love her so, so much and she was such a big part of my life, but now I can barely get through visits without breaking down.\nI hate seeing her like this and I\u2019m finding myself avoiding visits because I can\u2019t face seeing her in a wheelchair and being so confused. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left and I don\u2019t want to regret not seeing her more, but I don\u2019t know how to get through the visits. I feel so guilty, but I don\u2019t feel brave enough to go.\nIs there anything I can do?\n\u2013 Loving Granddaughter\nDear Granddaughter:\nThe grief we feel when a loved one develops dementia can be incredibly complex. I\u2019m so sorry for what your grandmother is going through and what you\u2019re experiencing. Right now, you\u2019re likely grieving the aspect of the relationship you\u2019ve lost, as well as what\u2019s going on in the present. You may also be feeling some grief about what\u2019s to come. That\u2019s a lot \u2013 past, present and future all coming together in every visit to the nursing home. So, please try to grant yourself some grace. This is hard and sometimes bravery looks different.\nRegret about not spending more time with a loved one, or not spending the right kind of time, is complicated, too. It\u2019s something we can rarely control, but which we can guide in a different direction. Before you visit your grandmother, remind yourself that if your grandmother doesn\u2019t remember you, that\u2019s not the full truth of your relationship. Pull up photos or videos that bring to mind times that felt happier for you. This phase is a part of her journey \u2013 and your shared journey together \u2013 but it\u2019s not the whole story.\nWhen a loved one is nearing the end of their life, we can sometimes develop an \u201call or nothing\u201d feeling. As if the way we respond is the only thing that\u2019s going to matter or the only thing we\u2019ll remember. That\u2019s not true, but it takes work to reinforce that internally.\nThis is a time for you to communicate where you are and what you\u2019re feeling with your parents and other loved ones. You can also reach out to a counselor at your school, if one is available, or look up dementia or grief support groups online. You\u2019ll find that you\u2019re not alone and you don\u2019t have to navigate this on your own. Take the time you need, be gentle with yourself, and hold on to the full arc of your grandmother\u2019s story.\nRead more Asking Eric\nAsking Eric: A childhood friend died and I want to know what happened\nAsking Eric: Our in-laws never invite us to holiday gatherings\nAsking Eric: I want to end my relationship to pursue a new \u2018crush\u2019\nAsking Eric: Estranged grandmother wants to reconnect with her granddaughter\nAsking Eric: Moving back home and starting a new life\n(\nSend questions to R.

Liman ruled that Lively\u2019s statements in her original complaint to the California Civil Rights Department \u2014 later included in her court filing \u2014 are legally privileged, making them immune from defamation claims,\nNBC News reports\n. He also found that Baldoni did not provide sufficient evidence that Lively\u2019s actions amounted to extortion under California law.\nBaldoni\u2019s related defamation suit against The New York Times\u2014seeking $250\u202fmillion\u2014was also dismissed under the \u201cfair report\u201d privilege, which shields accurate reporting on official complaints.\nThe judge did allow Baldoni the opportunity to amend his complaint by June 23 to pursue potential claims of breach of contract or similar.\nStories by\nMolly Walsh\nR&B icon dies; family reveals film about his life is in the works\nMore than 19,000 cases of popular soda pop recalled over labeling issue\nReporter shot by rubber bullet while on-air during Los Angeles protests\nUnited Airlines reveals new collab to improve in-flight entertainment\nNearly 2 million eggs recalled in 9 states over salmonella risk\nIn a statement, Lively\u2019s attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb called the ruling \u201ca total victory and a complete vindication\u201d for their client.\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,\u201d they told NBC in a statement.\nThey plan to request attorneys\u2019 fees, punitive damages and treble damages. Reynolds and Lively\u2019s publicist were similarly vindicated by the decision.\nThe legal battle first erupted in December 2024, when Lively accused Baldoni of a hostile work environment during filming It Ends With Us.

The neighborhood is now home to 15 residents and two live-in resident assistants, with amenities tailored to promote connection, independence, and well-being.\n\u201cThis community is a testament to what\u2019s possible when families, city leaders and supporters come together around a shared cause,\u201d said Ara Bagdasarian, co-founder and president of Solon Community Living. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just build homes, we built a model that can be replicated to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities across the country.\u201d\nLocated near the Solon Recreation Center, the new development includes 14 private homes, six caregiver suites, and a clubhouse with features such as a sensory-friendly space, teaching kitchen, and barrier-free design. The homes were constructed with accessibility in mind, with details like fire suppression systems, wide doorways, durable finishes, and backup generators.\nBefore the larger event began, residents and their families took part in a quieter pre-ceremony celebration designed to minimize overstimulation. The formal program included remarks from former Solon City Councilman Bill Russo, Planning Commission Chair Macke Bentley, and residents Evan Burg and Aletta Sinoff, who spoke about what the new community means to them.\nFor parents like Kristin and Tim LaCrosse, the moment carried special meaning. After years of searching for the right living environment for their daughter Jackie, they found it at Solon Community Living, where she now lives.\nThe project faced several challenges over the years, including zoning changes, a citywide ballot measure in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising construction costs. Despite the obstacles, the organization raised over $4 million to bring the vision to life.\nOne standout feature of the development is the inclusion of on-site caregiver housing. While two resident assistants have already moved in, four caregiver suites remain available, and the organization is actively seeking applicants. Bagdasarian said he hopes to build waitlists not only for future residents but for caregivers who want to be part of a supportive, stable work environment.\nNow that construction is complete, Solon Community Living is focused on expanding enrichment opportunities in partnership with the city\u2019s recreation department and documenting its approach to serve as a blueprint for other communities.\n\u201cWe built this not just for today, but for tomorrow, for when families ask, \u2018What happens when we\u2019re not here?\u2019\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cThis neighborhood is an answer to that question. And it\u2019s one that brings peace of mind.\u201d\nFor more information, visit\nsoloncommunityliving.org\n.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Completion of Solon Community Living neighborhood celebrated|Inclusive residential neighborhood for adults with developmental disabilities now open|Project culmination of over a decade of work|Aims to serve as a replicable model for improving quality of life for individuals with disabilities|Focus on expanding enrichment opportunities and documenting approach for other communities;E:Ribbon-cutting event held June 7|Pre-ceremony celebration to minimize overstimulation|Remarks from city officials and residents|Jackie LaCrosse found suitable living environment at Solon Community Living;D:15 residents|2 live-in resident assistants|14 private homes|6 caregiver suites|1 clubhouse|Sensory-friendly space|Teaching kitchen|Barrier-free design|Over $4 million raised|Ballot measure in 2019;", "er_digest": "N:Macke Bentley|Evan Burg|Ara Bagdasarian|Kristin LaCrosse|Tim LaCrosse|Bill Russo|Jackie LaCrosse|Aletta Sinoff;R:Ohio|United States;", "gist": "P:Completion of Solon Community Living neighborhood celebrated|Inclusive residential neighborhood for adults with developmental disabilities now open|Project culmination of over a decade of work|Aims to serve as a replicable model for improving quality of life for individuals with disabilities|Focus on expanding enrichment opportunities and documenting approach for other communities;E:Ribbon-cutting event held June 7|Pre-ceremony celebration to minimize overstimulation|Remarks from city officials and residents|Jackie LaCrosse found suitable living environment at Solon Community Living;D:15 residents|2 live-in resident assistants|14 private homes|6 caregiver suites|1 clubhouse|Sensory-friendly space|Teaching kitchen|Barrier-free design|Over $4 million raised|Ballot measure in 2019;N:Macke Bentley|Evan Burg|Ara Bagdasarian|Kristin LaCrosse|Tim LaCrosse|Bill Russo|Jackie LaCrosse|Aletta Sinoff;R:Ohio|United States;", "entities": ["Macke Bentley", "Evan Burg", "Ara Bagdasarian", "Kristin LaCrosse", "Tim LaCrosse", "Bill Russo", "Jackie LaCrosse", "Aletta Sinoff"], "regions": ["Ohio", "United States"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/06/theyre-getting-the-short-end-of-the-stick-ohios-funding-plans-abandon-urban-schools.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting the short end of the stick:\u201d Ohio\u2019s funding plans abandon urban schools\nUpdated: Jun. 09, 2025, 3:37 p.m.\n|\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 3:36 p.m.\nBy\nToday in Ohio\n|\ncleveland.com\nOhio\u2019s proposed school funding plans are creating a tale of two educational systems\u2014one for affluent suburbs and another for struggling urban districts, and Monday\u2019s\nToday in Ohio podcast\nanalyzed the motives for the formula.\nLeila Atassi discussed reporter\nLaura Hancock\u2019s findings in analyzing the three budget proposals from the governor, state House and state Senate\n: \u201cShe dug pretty deep into the numbers and she found a pretty clear trend, which is that suburban school districts with lower poverty rates and higher enrollment tend to do better, especially under the Senate\u2019s plan.

It works by using large fans to force air underneath the vehicle, which is contained by a flexible skirt, allowing it to hover slightly above the ground or water. This makes it ideal for rescue missions in areas that are hard to reach by traditional vehicles \u2014 like frozen lakes, marshes or flood zones \u2014 because it can glide over obstacles that would stop a boat or truck.\nLorain County saw opportunity in the unusual proposition and consulted with the Emergency Management Agency and fire department personnel, according to Hall. They all recognized the hovercraft\u2019s potential value for winter rescue operations on ponds and Lake Erie, as well as search missions involving people with disabilities who might wander near water.\n\u201cBoth vehicles -- the trailer, the hovercraft and our 2021 police cruiser -- are all valued about the same monetarily,\u201d Hall said during the meeting. \u201cSo, we figured not only was it a fair trade, but it\u2019s also helping a county that does not have a budget like ours and can\u2019t even afford to buy more than one new car every few years.\u201d\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Unusual vehicle exchange agreement approved|Lorain County traded a police vehicle for a hovercraft|Trade helps Morgan County with limited resources|Hovercraft suitable for rescue missions|Trade considered financially fairE:Lorain County Commissioners unanimously approved the trade|Sheriff James Fisher requested assistance from other sheriff's offices|Morgan County's vehicle fleet experienced failures|Lorain County consulted with Emergency Management Agency and fire department|Hall presented the proposal to commissionersD:Population of Morgan County is 15,000|Morgan County operates with 8 deputies|2011 Dodge Charger had 210,000 miles|Trade involves a 2021 Ford Explorer and a 2012 hovercraft|Summer Sale expires 6/30/25;", "er_digest": "N:Ford Explorer|Hannah Drown|Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Office|Dodge Charger|Lorain County Commissioners;R:Lake Erie;", "gist": "P:Unusual vehicle exchange agreement approved|Lorain County traded a police vehicle for a hovercraft|Trade helps Morgan County with limited resources|Hovercraft suitable for rescue missions|Trade considered financially fairE:Lorain County Commissioners unanimously approved the trade|Sheriff James Fisher requested assistance from other sheriff's offices|Morgan County's vehicle fleet experienced failures|Lorain County consulted with Emergency Management Agency and fire department|Hall presented the proposal to commissionersD:Population of Morgan County is 15,000|Morgan County operates with 8 deputies|2011 Dodge Charger had 210,000 miles|Trade involves a 2021 Ford Explorer and a 2012 hovercraft|Summer Sale expires 6/30/25N:Ford Explorer|Hannah Drown|Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Office|Dodge Charger|Lorain County Commissioners;R:Lake Erie;", "entities": ["Ford Explorer", "Hannah Drown", "Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Office", "Dodge Charger", "Lorain County Commissioners"], "regions": ["Lake Erie"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/advice/2025/06/miss-manners-im-a-widow-and-my-sons-wedding-shower-is-couples-only-do-i-not-go.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\nMiss Manners: I\u2019m a widow and my son\u2019s wedding shower is \u2018couples only:\u2019 Do I not go?\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 3:00 p.m.\nBy\nJudith Martin\nDEAR MISS MANNERS:\nMy youngest son is getting married this summer.

I am not dating anyone, and my ex-husband is dead, so I can\u2019t ask him. I am not sure what the correct way is to RSVP. I think this might be the first of other invites that will come this way.\nGENTLE READER:\nThe wording is unfortunate, but Miss Manners is guessing that it is not intended to say that you can\u2019t come to dinner unless you are married.\tRather, it is probably to suggest that single people should not bring what is (also unfortunately) known as a plus-one.\nAt least, let us hope so. Check with your son. If they really mean that they are running a Noah\u2019s Ark operation, he might want to reconsider hopping aboard.\n(Please send your questions to Miss Manners at her website,\nwww.missmanners.com\n; to her email,\ndearmissmanners@gmail.com\n; or through postal mail to Miss Manners, Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.)\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 JUDITH MARTIN DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106; 816-581-7500\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Wedding shower invitation specifies \"couples only\"|Widow unsure how to RSVP|Potential for similar invitations in the future|Son should reconsider if strictly enforced.E:Son's wedding shower invitation received|Widow seeking advice on RSVP|Miss Manners provides guidance.D:Date: Jun. 09, 2025|Time: 3:00 p.m.|Expiration Date: 6/30/25|Phone Number: 816-581-7500.;", "er_digest": "N:Andrews McMeel Syndication|Judith Martin;", "gist": "P:Wedding shower invitation specifies \"couples only\"|Widow unsure how to RSVP|Potential for similar invitations in the future|Son should reconsider if strictly enforced.E:Son's wedding shower invitation received|Widow seeking advice on RSVP|Miss Manners provides guidance.D:Date: Jun. 09, 2025|Time: 3:00 p.m.|Expiration Date: 6/30/25|Phone Number: 816-581-7500.N:Andrews McMeel Syndication|Judith Martin;", "entities": ["Andrews McMeel Syndication", "Judith Martin"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/community/2025/06/chagrin-falls-native-returns-home-bringing-comfort-silkie-baby-blanket-business-to-northeast-ohio.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\nFrom baby to boss: The heartwarming story behind Comfort Silkie\u2019s new owner\nUpdated: Jun. 09, 2025, 3:24 p.m.\n|\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 3:00 p.m.\nBy\nMatt Leavitt, special to cleveland.com\nCHAGRIN FALLS, Ohio -- As an infant, Paige Collins was wrapped in a Comfort Silkie Baby Blanket. Now, the Chagrin Falls resident owns the company and leads operations in the historic village.\nPaige, along with her husband, Steve, acquired Comfort Silkie -- a 38-year-old baby blanket manufacturing company based in California -- in April after the original owners decided to retire and were looking for potential buyers.\nThe former owners picked the Collins\u2019 bid for the company because they believed the couple would continue the company\u2019s legacy for numerous years.\nPaige Collins hopes the Comfort Silkie baby blankets will be available at their new and improved website,\nwww.comfortsilkie.com\n, in the next one to two months.\nComfort Silkie is the first brand to patent the \u201csecurity blanket\u201d for babies. The blankets are small and soft, so infants can hold them.\nIdeally, infants are comforted by the blankets by replicating the softness of the womb.\nProduction of the Comfort Silkie Baby Blankets has started at Seam in Cleveland. Seam owners Paula Pedaci and James Holloway have been cutting and sewing blankets for the inaugural Cleveland order.\nThey have been in communication with the former manufacturers of the Comfort Silkie Baby Blankets to ensure that the exact specifications are met.\nPaige Collins is currently running the daily operations of the business, including communicating with the manufacturer, placing fabric orders, managing the website and communicating with vendors.\nAfter stops in New York City and Columbus, the Chagrin Falls High School alumna returned to her hometown -- which was inevitable.\n\u201cI have always wanted to return to Chagrin ever since I left after I graduated high school in 2009. I absolutely loved growing up here with my three younger siblings,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo many of my friends stayed or moved back over the last few years,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI love having a close-knit group of friends and family that get to see our kids now growing up together. It is truly a dream come true.\u201d\nOnce the new website is launched, the company plans to ship orders across the United States and eventually around the globe.\nAdditionally, Collins would like to see Comfort Silkie Baby Blankets sold in retail locations on Main Street and other businesses in the Chagrin Valley.\nRead more from the\nChagrin Solon Sun\n.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Comfort Silkie Baby Blankets are being revitalized by new owners|Paige and Steve Collins acquired Comfort Silkie|The company aims to expand distribution nationally and globally|The new website is expected to launch in 1-2 months|Comfort Silkie pioneered the \"security blanket\" patent for babies;E:Paige Collins and Steve Collins acquired Comfort Silkie in April|Original owners retired and sought buyers|Production of blankets has started at Seam in Cleveland|Paige Collins is managing daily operations;D:Comfort Silkie is a 38-year-old company|Blankets are small and soft|Website: www.comfortsilkie.com|Paige Collins graduated high school in 2009;", "er_digest": "N:James Holloway|Paige Collins|Steve Collins|Paula Pedaci|Matt Leavitt;R:New York City|Cleveland|Chagrin Falls|United States|Ohio|Columbus|California;", "gist": "P:Comfort Silkie Baby Blankets are being revitalized by new owners|Paige and Steve Collins acquired Comfort Silkie|The company aims to expand distribution nationally and globally|The new website is expected to launch in 1-2 months|Comfort Silkie pioneered the \"security blanket\" patent for babies;E:Paige Collins and Steve Collins acquired Comfort Silkie in April|Original owners retired and sought buyers|Production of blankets has started at Seam in Cleveland|Paige Collins is managing daily operations;D:Comfort Silkie is a 38-year-old company|Blankets are small and soft|Website: www.comfortsilkie.com|Paige Collins graduated high school in 2009;N:James Holloway|Paige Collins|Steve Collins|Paula Pedaci|Matt Leavitt;R:New York City|Cleveland|Chagrin Falls|United States|Ohio|Columbus|California;", "entities": ["James Holloway", "Paige Collins", "Steve Collins", "Paula Pedaci", "Matt Leavitt"], "regions": ["New York City", "Cleveland", "Chagrin Falls", "United States", "Ohio", "Columbus", "California"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/06/more-than-19000-cases-of-popular-soda-pop-recalled-over-labeling-issue.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\nMore than 19,000 cases of popular soda pop recalled over labeling issue\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 2:45 p.m.\nBy\nMolly Walsh | mwalsh@cleveland.com\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Dr Pepper Zero Sugar is being recalled in three states over a labeling mishap.\nPepsi Beverages Co. has voluntarily recalled more than 19,000 cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar after discovering that some cans labeled as \u201czero sugar\u201d actually contained regular Dr Pepper.\nThe\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration classified\nthe recall as a Class II event, meaning the mislabeled products could cause temporary or medically reversible health issues. The classification was posted on June 6, though the company initiated the recall on May 23.\nThe affected products were produced at a Pepsi facility in Jacksonville, Florida, and distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The recall includes both 12-pack and 24-pack cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar.\nWhile the mislabeled soda poses no risk to most consumers, the FDA warns that people with conditions such as diabetes or others who closely monitor their sugar intake could experience adverse health effects from unknowingly consuming a sugar-sweetened beverage.\nPepsi has not issued a public statement on the matter, but the FDA urges consumers to check packaging codes against those listed in the agency\u2019s recall database.

We also hope this relocation will help establish a talent pipeline from our educational institutions, including Baldwin Wallace University and The Polaris Career Center.\u201d\nThe resolution outlines why Brook Park believes it is well-suited to host NASA\u2019s top leadership and operations. It calls NASA Glenn Research Center a \u201cworld-class institution advancing the aerospace and aeronautics innovation mission of the United States,\u201d and states the center contributes more than $2 billion each year to Ohio\u2019s economy through jobs and business development.\nOrcutt said Brook Park\u2019s long-standing ties with NASA Glenn would help ensure a smooth transition.\n\u201cThe existing strong professional relationship between the City and NASA Glenn leadership will ensure a successful relocation of the NASA Headquarters to Brook Park,\u201d Orcutt said.\nRecent developments further bolster the city\u2019s position in the aerospace sector. Blue Abyss, a U.K.-based company specializing in human spaceflight training and research, has signed a\nSpace Act Agreement with NASA Glenn\nand announced plans for a $250 million facility along Aerospace Parkway. The site will include a\n200-foot-deep astronaut training pool\nand is expected to create at least 200 high-skilled jobs in engineering, research, operations and education.\nCity officials say Brook Park is well-positioned to host NASA\u2019s headquarters because of its existing aerospace infrastructure, recent private-sector investment and Ohio\u2019s deep-rooted legacy in aviation and space exploration. The resolution describes Brook Park and Northeast Ohio as having \u201cunparalleled logistical advantages for NASA\u2019s ongoing and future missions to take humanity back to the Moon and beyond,\u201d citing the region\u2019s \u201ctransportation infrastructure, skilled workforce, manufacturing sector, and central location within the United States.\u201d\nOrcutt said the economic impact could be transformative for the community and the region.\n\u201cIt is unbelievable to think about the positive impact this would have on Brook Park and Cuyahoga County,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom job creation here in Brook Park, to increased opportunities for our students and young workers and further cementing Northeast Ohio as the global leader in space exploration and research, the potential is virtually unlimited.\u201d\nThe resolution also notes that Ohio has produced \u201csome of our nation\u2019s greatest pioneers in space exploration, including more astronauts than any other state,\u201d and agrees with federal and state leaders that a relocation would \u201creinforce Ohio\u2019s position as an international leader in space exploration and aeronautics innovation.\u201d\nTo continue pushing the proposal forward, Orcutt said the city is actively engaging with elected leaders at the federal level.\n\u201cI continue to personally work with our Federal Elected Officials, including Congressman Max Miller, to bring the NASA Headquarters to Brook Park,\u201d Orcutt said.\nHe said the response so far has been encouraging.\n\u201cThe responses I have received have been overwhelmingly supportive and cuts across political party lines,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is inspiring to see our leaders roll up their sleeves and be ready to get to work.\u201d\nCopies of the resolution will be sent to President Donald J. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro, members of Ohio\u2019s Congressional delegation and Gov. Mike DeWine.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Relocation of NASA headquarters to Brook Park is being urged by city officials|Opportunity for job growth and education|Potential for a talent pipeline from educational institutions|Economic impact could be transformative for the community and the region|Ohio has produced more astronauts than any other stateE:Brook Park City Council unanimously approved a resolution encouraging NASA relocation|Mayor Edward Orcutt supports the resolution|Blue Abyss announced plans for a $250 million facility|City officials are engaging with elected leaders at the federal level|Resolution will be sent to President Trump, Vice President Vance, Acting NASA Administrator Petro, and othersD:NASA lease expires in 2028|NASA Glenn contributes over $2 billion annually to Ohio's economy|Blue Abyss facility will include a 200-foot-deep astronaut training pool|Blue Abyss facility is expected to create at least 200 high-skilled jobs|Space Act Agreement signed with NASA Glenn;", "er_digest": "N:Janet Petro|Donald J.

And when you have the chance to grab the\n\u201cMazerati of hair styling tools,\u201d\nyou want the Mazerati of hair tools in your hands as soon as possible.\nDrybar All-Inclusive Air + Active Heat 8-in-1 Multi-Styler\n$299\nNew availability at retailers including ULTA and Amazon \u2014 with extended rollout throughout the summer.\nBuy now at ULTA\nIf you\u2019ve ever stood in front of your bathroom mirror juggling a blow dryer, a round brush, and a flat iron, only to end up with tired arms and frizzy hair, you\u2019re not alone.\nThe daily hair routine can feel like a full-body workout, especially when the summer heat adds its own layer of chaos and fatigue.\nWhat is the Drybar 8-in-1 Air & Active Heat Multi-Styler?\nThat\u2019s why Drybar\u2019s newest innovation, the\nAll-Inclusive 8-in-1 Air & Active Heat Multi-Styler\n, is making waves (literally and figuratively) among beauty lovers and busy people alike.\nAccording to Drybar, it\u2019s the first in their product lineup to combine heated airflow and heated ceramic plates in a single device. That means you\u2019re not just drying your hair, you\u2019re styling and setting it simultaneously.\nThis dual-heat technology is a game-changer, because it harnesses the power of a blow dryer and the precision of a hot tool in one sleek, golden-yellow wand.\nWhat is included with Drybar\u2019s Active Heat Multi-Styler?\nUnlike air-only stylers like the Dyson Airwrap or Shark FlexStyle, Drybar\u2019s Multi-Styler uses StyleLock Technology, which the company says optimizes the balance of air and heat to minimize long-term thermal damage. You\u2019ll be able to lock in shape and shine, all while reducing the need for repeated passes (i.e. you won\u2019t fry your strands).\nThe tool comes with four thoughtfully-designed attachments and a complimentary heat-resistant storage bag:\nThe Concentrator:\nPreps and smooths hair with a dual-sided nozzle \u2014 ideal for fast drying and frizz control.\nThe Flat Iron:\nFor sleek, straight styles that don\u2019t fall flat by noon.\nThe Curling Iron:\nA 1\u2033 barrel that delivers defined curls and waves with the help of active heat.\nThe Round Blow-Dryer Brush:\nA 2.5\u2033 barrel that lifts at the roots and adds serious volume and shine.\nWith four airflow settings and three heat levels, the\nMulti-Styler adapts to your hair\u2019s needs\n, whether you\u2019re working with fine strands or thick curls. A Pause Button lets you stop airflow mid-style to section out hair and/or switch out your attachment easier. And the Air Curler Flipper gives you the option to style with or without airflow = you have ultimate control.\nEach attachment is ceramic-coated, as well, which Drybar confirms\nhelps ensure even heat distribution and smooth styling across all hair types.\nOne reviewer shares that she\u2019s had several multi-styling tools over the years, but Drybar\u2019s All-Inclusive fills in the gaps where the others fall short.\n\u201cMy hair doesnt always hold styles the best - curls fall out, straight hair gets puffy. BUT\u2026 this tool does everything perfectly,\u201c the San Antonio, TX customer says. \u201dI had a Dyson, Shark, and even the drugstore dupes, but those tools don\u2019t have metal plates while blowdrying, only plastic. My styles simply last longer with metal plates and also require less heat and time styling the hair.\u201c\nSummer hair care is notoriously tricky, because humidity, sweat, and sun can undo hours of styling in mere minutes. But the\nMulti-Styler\u2019s ability to dry, style, and set in one go means less time under hot tools\nand more time enjoying the sunshine.\nPlus, the added volume and shine are perfect for those effortless, beachy looks we all crave this time of year.\nHow much does Drybar\u2019s multi-styler cost?\nThe new multi-styler is $299\nand sold directly at\nDrybar\u2019s website\n, as well as\nULTA\nand\nAmazon\nfor the same $299 price. That is $301 less than the\nDyson Airwrap\n\u2019s $600 price tag.\nIt is eligible for coupons at ULTA, even that illustrious 20% off prestige.\nULTA Beauty Rewards members\ncan redeem their points when purchasing this for an added discount.

Instead, she rescheduled the hearings for 10:30 a.m. July 9.\nA jury found King, 57, guilty on May 29 of three fourth-degree felonies: theft in office and two counts of having an unlawful interest in a public contract, along with misdemeanor offenses. The conviction marked the end of his tenure in office, which began in 2016.\nEach fourth-degree felony is punishable by community control or up to 18 months in prison.\nKing was acquitted of a second count of theft in office related to fuel purchased by Smith. Smith, 49, was found guilty of theft in office and two counts of felony theft, along with misdemeanor offenses, related to his personal use of a city vehicle.\nFor his part, King steered more than $75,000 in city money to companies he or his family owned, according to prosecutors.\nBecause of their convictions, both men are barred from seeking public office for seven years.\nGallagher delayed the sentencings because she said she didn\u2019t have much time to \u201cdigest\u201d a sentencing memorandum filed by prosecutors Friday. They asked for prison terms and restitution for both defendants.\nShe ordered defense attorneys to respond to prosecutors ahead of the rescheduled sentencing date.\nAndrew Rogalski, an assistant county prosecutor, argued that King\u2019s criminal behavior escalated over time and showed an \u201congoing pattern.\u201d He said Gallagher should weigh King\u2019s position as mayor in determining whether prison is warranted and asked her to consider consecutive sentences.\n\u201cThe higher the position, the worse the betrayal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe higher the position, the harder the crime is to prevent, stop, rectify or appropriately address after the fact.\u201d\nRogalski said King should be required to repay $3,845 that the city paid to a King family business in July 2024, along with the cost of the investigation. Rogalski included a cost itemization with $12,521 for the Ohio Ethics Commission deputy director and $5,673 for the special investigator.\nRogalski additionally asked the court to adopt a state auditor\u2019s finding that King owes the city $6,791. He also requested King pay the cost of the audit itself, at $6,416.\nRogalski similarly asked the court to make Smith repay nearly $7,000 spent on fuel, along with the cost of the audit.\nGallagher on Monday asked the defendants to submit their responses by the end of the month.\nWith King out of office, interim Mayor Sandra Morgan and City Council President Lateek Shabazz are\nfighting over King\u2019s seat\n.\nLast week, Shabazz asked the 8th Ohio District Court of Appeals to declare him King\u2019s replacement. Shabazz\u2019s attorney, Ken Myers, filed a quo warranto, which arises from a dispute over who holds public office.

Garland\u2019s status will be updated in approximately 4-5 months. Sources tell cleveland.com he could miss time at the start of the regular season.\nMore Cavs coverage\nThe Cavs should do something, but what? \u2014 Terry Pluto\nHow the Indiana Pacers became every NBA team\u2019s ultimate playoff nightmare\nReacting to Game 1 of the NBA Finals and the Pacers continuing to make history: Wine and Gold Talk podcast\nSources say Garland, who missed four playoff games, was still feeling pain and soreness in his big toe nearly a month after the team\u2019s Game 5 Eastern Conference semifinal loss to the Indiana Pacers. After trying to give it extended time to heal on its own, everyone decided that surgery was the best option. The belief is this step will finally remedy the problem, provide him some much-needed relief and perhaps keep it from recurring next season.\nThe injury, which has been described as something similar to turf toe, first started bothering Garland in late March, toward the end of the regular season. He then re-injured his toe toward the end of Cleveland\u2019s Game 2 win over the Miami Heat in the first round.\nEven though Garland gutted through the pain and returned for the final three games of the conference semifinals, he was severely limited.\nIn three games against Indiana, Garland averaged just 14.0 points on 34.2% from the field and 16.7% from 3-point range. The Cavs lost the series 4-1.\nComing off what he called one of the most difficult seasons of his life, Garland vowed to rediscover his joy and pre-injury form in 2024-25.\nHe played a career-high 75 regular-season games, averaging 20.6 points and 6.7 assists while shooting 47.2% from the field and 40.1% from 3-point range. The longest-tenured member of the Cavaliers, Garland was named an All-Star reserve for the second time in his career.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Darius Garland underwent surgery to repair a big toe injury|Garland is expected to make a full recovery|Garland could miss time at the start of the regular season|Garland vows to rediscover his joy and pre-injury form in 2024-25;E:Garland underwent surgery on Monday|Garland missed four playoff games|Cavs lost the series 4-1 against Indiana Pacers|Garland re-injured his toe during Game 2 against Miami Heat;D:Surgery performed by Dr. Nicholas Strasser|Surgery performed in consultation with Dr. James Rosneck and Dr. Bob Anderson|Garland averaged 14.0 points against Indiana|Garland averaged 20.6 points in the regular season|Garland shot 47.2% from the field|Garland shot 40.1% from 3-point range|Sale expires 6/30/25;", "er_digest": "N:Cleveland Clinic|Dr. James Rosneck|Dr. Nicholas Strasser|Cavs|Chris Fedor|OrthoCarolina|Vanderbilt University Medical Center|Darius Garland|Indiana Pacers;R:Ohio|Indiana|Cleveland|Miami;", "gist": "P:Darius Garland underwent surgery to repair a big toe injury|Garland is expected to make a full recovery|Garland could miss time at the start of the regular season|Garland vows to rediscover his joy and pre-injury form in 2024-25;E:Garland underwent surgery on Monday|Garland missed four playoff games|Cavs lost the series 4-1 against Indiana Pacers|Garland re-injured his toe during Game 2 against Miami Heat;D:Surgery performed by Dr. Nicholas Strasser|Surgery performed in consultation with Dr. James Rosneck and Dr. Bob Anderson|Garland averaged 14.0 points against Indiana|Garland averaged 20.6 points in the regular season|Garland shot 47.2% from the field|Garland shot 40.1% from 3-point range|Sale expires 6/30/25;N:Cleveland Clinic|Dr. James Rosneck|Dr. Nicholas Strasser|Cavs|Chris Fedor|OrthoCarolina|Vanderbilt University Medical Center|Darius Garland|Indiana Pacers;R:Ohio|Indiana|Cleveland|Miami;", "entities": ["Cleveland Clinic", "Dr. James Rosneck", "Dr. Nicholas Strasser", "Cavs", "Chris Fedor", "OrthoCarolina", "Vanderbilt University Medical Center", "Darius Garland", "Indiana Pacers"], "regions": ["Ohio", "Indiana", "Cleveland", "Miami"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/letters/2025/06/trumps-appalling-mental-health-cuts-for-veterans-who-desperately-need-those-services.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\nTrump\u2019s appalling mental health cuts for veterans who desperately need those services\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 1:16 p.m.\nBy\nOther Voices\nAs a veteran, I\u2019m appalled by the recent cuts to Veterans Affairs services by the Trump administration. Specifically, the cuts to mental health services are devastating, leaving vulnerable veterans without access to critical support. The VA\u2019s own data show that mental health issues are a leading cause of concern for veterans.\nIn protest of these cuts, I attended last week\u2019s June 6 D-Day \u201cUnite for Veterans\u201d rally in Washington, D.C. -- an event that honored the bravery and sacrifice of those who served, and that serves as a reminder of the importance of supporting our veterans. We must stand together to demand better support for our veterans and their families.\nIt\u2019s particularly galling that these cuts are happening as many veterans, including those with disabilities, are being targeted for cuts as part of federal workforce layoffs. Nearly a third of federal employees are veterans, many of whom work best from home due to service-related disabilities. Supporting veterans in and out of government service should be a priority.\nI urge all who care about veterans\u2019 welfare to join me in speaking out against these harmful cuts and advocating for the resources our veterans deserve.\nMark Szabo,\nRocky River\nThe writer deployed with the U.S. Navy on the USS Vincennes in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and twice to Iraq with the U.S. Army during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Cuts to Veterans Affairs mental health services are devastating|Targeting veterans for workforce layoffs is galling|Supporting veterans should be a priority|Advocating for resources for veterans is crucial;E:June 6 D-Day \"Unite for Veterans\" rally in Washington, D.C.|Federal workforce layoffs targeting veterans;D:Nearly a third of federal employees are veterans|Expiration date: 6/30/25;", "er_digest": "N:U.S. Navy|Veterans Affairs|Trump|U.S. Army|Operation Enduring Freedom|Operation Iraqi Freedom|Mark Szabo;R:Iraq;", "gist": "P:Cuts to Veterans Affairs mental health services are devastating|Targeting veterans for workforce layoffs is galling|Supporting veterans should be a priority|Advocating for resources for veterans is crucial;E:June 6 D-Day \"Unite for Veterans\" rally in Washington, D.C.|Federal workforce layoffs targeting veterans;D:Nearly a third of federal employees are veterans|Expiration date: 6/30/25;N:U.S. Navy|Veterans Affairs|Trump|U.S. Army|Operation Enduring Freedom|Operation Iraqi Freedom|Mark Szabo;R:Iraq;", "entities": ["U.S. Navy", "Veterans Affairs", "Trump", "U.S. Army", "Operation Enduring Freedom", "Operation Iraqi Freedom", "Mark Szabo"], "regions": ["Iraq"]}, {"_id": "https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/06/the-20-million-question-should-the-browns-get-your-beer-money-if-they-leave-cleveland.html", "content": "Skip to Article\nQuick Look\n-\nCurrent\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTonight\nLow\n-\nMostly Sunny\nTomorrow\nHigh\n-\nMostly Sunny\nSummer Sale - Start Today for $1 - Expires 6/30/25\nThe $20 million question: Should the Browns get your beer money if they leave Cleveland?\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 1:10 p.m.\nBy\nToday in Ohio\n|\ncleveland.com\nA high-stakes battle is brewing over who controls Cuyahoga County\u2019s sin tax dollars, and\nToday in Ohio podcasts hosts\nare questioning the reason that Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne has taken a firm stand against the Cleveland Browns receiving a third of the revenue.\nThe sin tax\u2014a levy on alcohol and cigarettes that helps fund sports venues\u2014was originally created to support facilities in downtown Cleveland. Now, with the Browns considering a $2.4 billion stadium in Brook Park,\nRonayne is pushing back against state budget provisions that would guarantee the team an equal share of those dollars.\nLeila Atassi explained Ronayne\u2019s position: \u201cHis argument is that the sin tax, that\u2019s the one on things like beer, wine, and cigarettes, that it was originally meant to support\u2026 sports venues in Cleveland, not in Brook park or anywhere else.\u201d\nThe county executive is particularly concerned that including the Browns in a future ballot measure to extend the sin tax could doom the entire effort. According to Johnston, Ronayne claims \u201cthat internal polling shows that voters are souring on the Browns and that their presence on the ballot could doom efforts to keep Progressive Field and Rocket arena properly funded.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s something suspicious about this mysterious poll. As Chris Quinn pointed out, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it released? Why aren\u2019t we seeing the details behind it? Everybody\u2019s whispering the Browns being involved will tank the tax. Now, that could happen. I know people don\u2019t like the Haslams because of their politics and some of the decisions they\u2019ve made, but if the poll is that reliable, where is it? Why aren\u2019t we seeing the science behind it?\u201d\nAtassi echoed these concerns: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the top line results of this poll, but without the methodology, we can\u2019t say whether this is solid public opinion research or just some strategic PR move.\u201d\nThe Browns claim they haven\u2019t lobbied for the provision, though they say they\u2019d welcome the money for future stadium maintenance. Meanwhile, state lawmakers are also considering $600 million in public lending for the stadium from other sources.\nWhat\u2019s particularly troubling about the sin tax situation is how it\u2019s unfolded\u2014largely behind closed doors, without public input or transparency. Quinn noted, \u201cIf this would have been an adult negotiation in the sunshine -- I can\u2019t believe how secretive this was. We didn\u2019t know about it till about a month ago -- they would have done this all in the sunshine and done it all righteously.\u201d\nThe core issues here extend beyond just who gets what money.

The overwhelming consensus from readers was that such behavior is not only worth covering, but is a threat to the functioning of democracy itself.\nAt the federal level, readers pointed to former President Trump\u2019s threat to rescind government contracts from Elon Musk in a personal feud, arguing such action abuses federal power for personal vendetta. \u201cIf Musk\u2019s contracts serve the public, they shouldn\u2019t be politicized,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cTo revoke them as punishment hurts us all.\u201d\nOhio State Senator Jerry Cirino also drew considerable ire. His push to eliminate a sales tax exemption on newspaper advertising\u2014a move I called retaliation for critical press coverage \u2014struck many readers as an attack on the First Amendment.\n\u201cA thin-skinned lawmaker using taxation to punish criticism is not just petty. It\u2019s dangerous,\u201d wrote. Others questioned Cirino\u2019s commitment to democracy and labeled him \u201cTrumpian in style and substance.\u201d\nCloser to home, Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb and Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne\u2019s withdrawal from Greater Cleveland Partnership committees over a dispute regarding the Browns stadium plan divided opinion. While some readers viewed their move as another act of petty defiance, others argued the pair acted on principle.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think their protest reaches the same level as Trump or Cirino,\u201d wrote one reader, \u201cThey left because GCP was no longer representing Cleveland\u2019s interests.\u201d But even sympathetic voices expressed concern over the optics. \u201cYou sway influence from the inside, not by walking out in protest,\u201d another wrote.\nMany saw a common thread: personal grudges outweighing public service. \u201cWe are being governed by children,\u201d one reader lamented. \u201cThese people were elected to serve everyone\u2014not just themselves or their donors.\u201d\nSome readers also worried about false equivalency. \u201cNot every protest or disagreement is retribution,\u201d said one. \u201cLet\u2019s be careful not to lump principled opposition with authoritarian behavior.\u201d Others argued for a more nuanced and solutions-oriented approach: \u201cWe need a press that doesn\u2019t just call out the bad, but uplifts the good. That\u2019s how we start restoring trust.\u201d\nStill, most readers didn\u2019t hesitate to connect the dots. They described a political culture now steeped in ego, vengeance, and tribal loyalty. \u201cThis is a national sickness,\u201d wrote another. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t invent it, but he made it fashionable.\u201d\nSome worried the press is becoming complicit by normalizing such behavior. \u201cReport it, yes,\u201d one reader urged, \u201cbut without descending into the same name-calling and pettiness you\u2019re criticizing.\u201d Others passionately defended journalism\u2019s role: \u201cYou\u2019re the watchdogs. Without you, there\u2019s no accountability. Please keep doing this work.\u201d\nThe responses also offered a clear takeaway: People are hungry for leadership that serves the public good over personal interest.\n\u201cWe need statesmen, not score-settlers,\u201d said one. \u201cThe stakes are too high for juvenile games.\u201d\nHere are six of the most provocative responses:\n\u201cThis is who we are now. These are elected representatives acting in ways I would not tolerate from my children.\u201d\n\u201cCirino\u2019s push to tax newspapers is a blatant First Amendment violation. If that\u2019snot news, what is?\u201d\n\u201cThe egos of our \u2018leaders\u2019 interfere with the needs of the people. It\u2019s horrifying.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cI had 8th graders more respectful than these officials. We need grownups in charge.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Pee Wee Herman in politics: \u2018I know you are, but what am I?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cTrump made vengeance fashionable. Now everyone thinks it\u2019s part of the job.\u201d\nNote: This is the second in a new series of pieces summarizing comments received in response to text messages I send each morning about stories we have in the works or questions we seek to answer.

after his mum ran out of milk.\nAngie Nelson, 53, runs Home Farm - where she has one of the\nUK's largest herd of reindeers\n- and was thrilled when one of her females, Lumi, three, gave birth to her first calf, Lars, on May 17.\n\u200c\nBut Lumi's milk quickly dried up and, worried Lars would not survive without intervention, Angie stepped in to be his 'surrogate mum' and hand-rear him at four days old.\n\u200c\nShe brought Lars home to the farmhouse in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, she shares with fiance, Justin Mumford, 51, a\nforestry consultant, their four children, and three dogs\n.\nLars, now two weeks old, spends all his time with Angie - being bottle fed every two to three hours and sleeping curled up against her on the living room floor.\nAngie with Lars who lives in her home, shared with spaniel 'siblings'\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\nArticle continues below\nHe wakes at 6am and spends the day honing his hooves running round the garden with spaniels Jess, 13, Molly, six, and Meg, three.\nThe lovable calf has tapped into pup Molly's maternal instinct and she licks him to wash him all over and even cuddles up with him - even allowing him to affectionately nibble her ears.\nAngie - who's been a reindeer farmer for 18 years - has never heard of a calf being hand-reared before and thinks Lars may be the first in Britain, at least in recent times.\n\u200c\nAngie said: \"Lars is gorgeous and I feel very lucky to be raising him in this way.\n\"I'm absolutely exhausted but I just keep reminding myself how lucky we are to have him.\n\"I don't know of anyone who has bottle raised a reindeer calf, and I've been searching for advice, so I think he's the only one in the UK for a very long time at least.\n\u200c\nReindeer Lars is being raised with spaniels\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\"He will go back to the herd in time, but we'll always have a very special bond.\"\nLars was born weighing just 6lbs - 2lbs below the average weight of a reindeer calf, on May 17.\n\u200c\nWild reindeer mums usually isolate themselves and their calves for a week, then return to the herd where the mothers combine forces to share looking after their babies, even feeding each other's calves.\nAngie became watchful when Lars was interested in the dry feed she brings twice-daily to the herd.\nOn his second day she moved him and first-time-mum Lumi to a stable and noticed he wasn't getting much milk.\n\u200c\nThe situation didn't improve after an oxytocin injection - to help start milk production - for Lumi from the vet.\nOn day four when Lars began to weaken, Angie made the tough call to raise him herself - after he'd already had a special tube feed into his tummy to help him gain weight and strength.\nShe got a special tiny bottle teat from the vet and started giving Lars formula milk specially for baby\nanimals\nlike sheep and goats.\n\u200c\nLars is full of beans now and gaining weight well.\nAngie said: \"I think it's so rare to bottle raise a reindeer calf because it's hard to spot that they aren't getting enough milk until it's very late and they are very weak.\n\"I'm lucky that Lars let me know he was hungry so I started watching very early.\n\u200c\n\"You don't take a calf from its mum unless you absolutely have to, but he was making it very clear from early on that he was hungry and we could see she didn't have much milk.\"\nLars has taken to home life very well\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\nLars is named after Everest climber Lars Kropp because on his first day in the house he broke out of his play pen and made his way upstairs.\n\u200c\nHe likes to sleep with his head on Angie's shoulder and nudges her awake when he's hungry.\nCalves are less portable than human babies, so Angie has to stick around all the time, occasionally sneaking out while Lars is asleep, or when she secures a baby sitter.\nShe and Justin - who have four children between them - are getting married on the farm, on June 21, so Angie has been fitting in wedding organising around Lars' daily routine.\n\u200c\nOn the farm they have 43 reindeer, mini donkeys, ponies, sand goats, a goose and a couple of alpacas.\nThe reindeer have appeared at red-carpet events for Frozen film premieres as well as on Tesco and Homebase adverts.\nThe animals were always going to feature at the wedding, Angie says, but there might need to be a special place for Lars now.\n\u200c\nShe said: \"It was a massive decision to hand raise him, I was terrified.\n\"It's a huge responsibility and I knew it would change my life completely the moment I did it, but he would have died if I didn't.\n\"In my head he would be living in a stable by the wedding, but I think it's likely he'll still be living with us.\nArticle continues below\n\"I honestly can't believe this has happened.\"\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our\nnewsletters\n.\nFollow Daily Star:\n\u200c\nAnimals\nFamily\n\u200c\nAt\nReach and across our entities\nwe and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

While her other half Jamie, 38, has kept his status as one of the Premier League's big earners, bagging about \u00a37.3m at Leicester City last term, and now eyeing a possible move to\nManchester United\n. Now there's a rumour that the family might be selling their holiday home now the\nthe Wagatha Christie\nsaga and its aftermath are behind them.\n\u200c\nThe Vardys have previously rented out their beloved villa in the posh Quinta do Lago golf resort for as much as \u00a330,000 a week, but they've now grudgingly decided to list it.\n\u200c\nRebekah enjoyed family holidays there\n(Image: @beckyvardy/Instagram)\nA friend of the pair\ntold the Mirror\n: \"They are selling the Portuguese pad - and are looking at different holiday places now. They had some great times there, but just decided it was time for a change.\n\"It's actually laughable for anyone to think it has anything to do with the court case. Nothing could be further from the truth. And that's shown by the fact that they are looking for a new holiday pad.\"\nArticle continues below\nThe property is on the market with upscale estate agents Knight Frank, boasting a hefty \u00a39.7 million asking price. Despite recent price hikes in the Algarve, some as high as 16% according to estimates, the Vardys' villa is considered 'optimistically priced', one agent anonymously told MailOnline.\n\"It's undoubtedly a stunning and very modern property, but there are many more traditionally-styled places in that area which some people might prefer, of similar size, but priced a lot more competitively,\" he noted. The villa, complete with three pools, a gym, a steam room and six bedrooms, overlooks the 18th green of the resort's North course.\nKnight Frank has lauded the property, stating: \"This magnificent property, built over four levels, showcases meticulous attention to lifestyle details.\"\n\u200c\nThe property boasts four floors\n(Image: Instagram/ @beckyvardy)\nThe four-storey abode also includes a cinema room, roof terrace and sauna, spread across roughly 0.64 acres. Further details reveal: 'In addition to the three external pools, which epitomise a contemporary lifestyle, the villa includes a central electro-chromic glass lift accessing each floor.\n\"The impressively landscaped gardens complement the property's style, creating a true haven for modern living. The villa is conveniently located within walking distance of the golf course and other renowned amenities within the Quinta do Lago resort.\"\n\u200c\nIn 2022, the couple faced a terrifying ordeal when their luxury villa came under threat from nearby forest fires. A family insider revealed to The Sun at the time: \"It's been horrifying. Their neighbours have all been evacuated, and one by one, residents are being told to leave their homes.\n\"Becky can see smoke everywhere, and she's terrified about the kids breathing it in. The water is also down, so she's relying on bottled water, which, obviously, there is only a finite amount of at home.\n\"Jamie and their friends and family back home have all been really worried. Things are developing by the hour, but she's praying the fire brigades, who have been brilliant, can get things back under control. She's genuinely worried. Things are evolving by the hour, but she's hoping that the fire brigades, who have been outstanding, can regain control,\" the insider said.\n\u200c\nThe Vardy family enjoy quality time together\n(Image: @beckyvardy/Instagram)\nVardy had also been involved in a highly publicised dispute with Rooney, which culminated in a High Court case in 2022 that Vardy lost. The infamous \"Wagatha Christie\" saga began with a dramatic open letter penned by Rooney and shared on social media in October 2019, in which she revealed that she had played detective to uncover who had been leaking stories to the press.\nRooney publicly claimed that Mrs Vardy's account was the source of three newspaper stories featuring false details she had posted on her private Instagram profile - her trip to Mexico for a 'gender selection' procedure, her plans to return to TV, and the flooding in her home's basement.\nArticle continues below\nRebekah vehemently denied the accusation and sought to sue Coleen, initiating a libel case that escalated to the High Court. The 2022 trial didn't go in Rebekah's favour and the judge ruled in favour of Rooney.\nThe Daily Star has reached out to Vardy's spokesperson for comment.\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our\nnewsletters\n.\nFollow Daily Star:\nComments\n\u200c\nColeen Rooney\nRebekah Vardy\n\u200c\nAt\nReach and across our entities\nwe and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

Thus, the Yanks wanted to open the potential to find a second or third baseman if necessary.\nLeMahieu, whose six-year $90 million deal runs through 2026, told Sherman he does not think he\u2019s facing any kind of deadline to produce.\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d LeMahieu said. \u201cI have too much else to focus on.\u201d\nLeMahieu\nis batting .258/.333/.371 (99 OPS+) with two home runs and nine RBIs in 20 games (69 at-bats) since returning from a calf injury that he suffered in spring training.

Bedford is expected to face sharp questions about his resume as well as his positions on several hot-button aviation topics.\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know ahead of the hearing, as well essential reading from\nThe Air Current\non the state of the FAA and the crises it is facing.\nIn April,\nThe Air Current\ndetailed\nBedford\u2019s history of strong, opinionated viewpoints on a host of important aviation issues\n\u2014 positions that may come back to haunt him this week. Perhaps most significant of those is his longstanding criticism of pilot training requirements \u2014\nknown as the 1,500 hour rule\n\u2014 born out of the 2009 Colgan Air crash, which have forced regional carriers into\u00a0 an acute shortage of qualified pilots. This issue, as well as Bedford\u2019s past exaggeration of his credentials as a commercial pilot, could spell a difficult grilling for the nominee, particularly from Democratic Senators.\nWhere Bedford has historically been more outspoken, acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau (who will continue as Deputy Administrator upon an administrator\u2019s confirmation)\ntold\nTAC\nin an exclusive interview in March\nthat he sees his role as a quieter \u201cinside force\u201d at the agency. This combination of leadership styles could balance out, though Wednesday\u2019s hearing will reveal how Bedford may be forced to refine some of his polarizing positions in order to seek broader support from the committee.\nBedford used his Senate ethics questionnaire, which\nTAC\nhas reviewed, to bolster his credentials for\nsolving the ATC staffing crisis\n, saying he knows \u201csomething about overcoming serious staffing challenges,\u201d an overlapping reference to the 1,500-hour rule-induced pilot shortage.\nIf confirmed, Bedford will join the FAA as it faces a number of critical challenges. In April, President Donald Trump\u2019s Administration laid out plans for what could be the\nsingle largest investment\nin the modernization of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, spurred by the January fatal midair collision near Washington, D.C. The success of that modernization effort will require Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to advocate for tens of billions of dollars from Congress to pay for the upgrades \u2014 an effort Bedford would be helping to spearhead.\nThe agency is simultaneously grappling with the departure of a sizable portion of its experienced career workforce, the implementation of a\nlitany of executive orders\n, the finalizing of significant new rulemaking for the general aviation industry and the hiring of thousands of air traffic controllers.\nLast week, Trump signed three significant executive orders designed to advance the integration of drones and advanced air mobility aircraft into the NAS as well as one that directed the FAA to effectively repeal the decades-long ban on overland supersonic flight \u2014 things that Bedford will also have to implement as administrator.\nEssential reading from\nThe Air Current:\nBryan Bedford\u2019s history of grabbing aviation\u2019s third rails\nThe acting FAA administrator is happy to stay off camera\nDOT seeks single \u2018integrator\u2019 for ambitious ATC modernization plan\nWhat\u2019s missing from the debate over the 1,500-hour rule\nThrust into national spotlight, aviation industry pushes for FAA budget reform\nThe opportunity and obstacles on the road to \u2018supercharging\u2019 ATC hiring\nExplore our full research archive\nhere\n.\nZeen is a next generation WordPress theme.

Held at the base of Mt Fuji, in Gotemba, Japan, the country's military took part in an annual war games-style drill this week.\nIt took place after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated in March that Japan should increase its defence spending to at least 3% of GDP as soon as possible, in response to pressure from the United States.\nIt also comes as tension increases with nearby North Korea and China \u2013 as well as Russia's continued onslaught on Ukraine in Europe.\nWorrying images from the training exercise show Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) battle tanks firing ammunition during a live-fire exercise, while others show troops firing mortors into the air.\nMore and more tanks were seen firing ammo into the mountain range, as the manoeuvrers reflect the JSDF's ongoing transformation, increasingly focused on rapid response, interoperability with allies, and a stronger role within the Indo-Pacific security framework.\nAround 76.6 metric tons of ammo were used, costing around \u00a35m, while 50 tanks and 60 cannons took part alongside 2,000 fighters.\nAccording to local news outlet Mainichi: \u201cSome components of long-range missiles under development, which aim to strike enemy missile-firing locations in emergency situations, were also revealed for the first time. The apparent aim is to domestically and internationally publicise Japan's enhanced ability to hit enemy bases in such situations.\u201d\nAlthough no officials have commented on this year's event, former GSDF Chief of Staff General Koji Yamazaki said of the previous year's training: \u201cThere are various issues and uncertain factors such as China's forceful attempt to change the status quo in the East and South China Sea areas, North Korea's promotion of ballistic missile development and nuclear weapons and Russia's display of its presence in the Far East.\n\u201cThe severity of the security situation surrounding our country... is increasing.\u201d\nWar games\nShare\nComments\nIncreased tension\nShare\nComments\nRising temperatures\nShare\nComments\nPreparation\nShare\nComments\nWorrying times\nShare\nComments\nPrepare for battle\nShare\nComments\nHuge cost\nShare\nComments\nThousands of soldiers\nShare\nComments\nWW3 fears increasing\nShare\nComments\nProtection\nShare\nComments\nMore On\nWorld War 3\nStudents\nUK school closes to pupils as beloved teacher dies suddenly\nJonathan Scott, a teacher at Archbishop Beck Catholic College in Aintree, died yesterday, according to the school's headteacher Paul Stirling\nMadeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner's lair finds new evidence as cops find 'mask'\nMadeleine Mccann\nMadeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner wrote a sick story about a \"paradise\" with a small five year old girl, a description eerily similar to Maddie when she went missing\nBrit tourist, 21, found dead on streets of popular party resort as probe launched\nBreaking News\nPortuguese police are understood to have ruled out any link to a crime and are said to be treating the death as a tragedy linked to excessive alcohol consumption\nNew Covid strain discovered in UK as health chiefs reveal 'unusual' symptoms\nCoronavirus\nThe full list of symptoms caused by the new NB.1.8.1 strain of coronavirus, which has been detected in at least seven people in Northern Ireland, has been announced\nCrack-riddled UK seaside town where junkies bunk down in grim 'Death Row' street\nDrugs\nThe street of a seaside town has been overrun by druggies as an abundance of drug dealing has caused a mini crime wave to hit the town \u2013 residents have nickname the street 'Death Row'\nJeremy Clarkson\nClarkson's Farm fans 'hate everything' about two 'insufferable' stars in latest season\nTwo stars of Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon Prime show Clarkson's Farm were slammed by viewers as they said they 'hated everything' about the auntie-niece duo\nNoel Edmonds signs up to new telly show to prove he's not dead yet\nITV\nAfter decades on the box on shows including Noel\u2019s House Party and Deal or No Deal, Noel Edmonds is hoping viewers will finally get to see the real him in the brand new ITV show\nTeacher struck off after racy account found and sent round school by 'excited' schoolboys\nJobs\nA teacher was struck off after pupils found an account promoting adult content -

along with Gary Barlow dig'\nOPINION: Robbie Williams is back - and better than ever. The 90s pop icon graced Emirates Stadium at the weekend and let's just say he won't 'wash' up on a Butlins stage anytime soon\ndailystar\nBookmark\nShare\nComments\nShowbiz\nReview\nBy\nLayla Nicholson\nSenior Features Writer\n20:56, 9 JUN 2025\nBookmark\nIn a time where we're\nall hungry for 90s nostalgia\n, Robbie Williams has quelled that hollow pit with his comeback Brit Pop tour - and expertly so.\nLaunching into the limelight with Take That\nat the tender age of just 16, Robbie cemented his 'cheeky chappy, bad boy' persona of the group and was known for 'not having the best vocals'. It's something\nthe now 51-year-old\ncontinually quipped at on his first night at the Emirates Stadium over the weekend.\nHowever, the supposed weakness of his voice appeared to always be a long-peddled myth. He might be able to put on a camp fun-infused production, but he can also\nstill\nbelt out his hits that served as the soundtrack to many young womens' lives in the 90s and early 00s.\nHe kicks off the night with new punky single 'Rocket' to 60,000 fans - young, old and someone dressed up as Ali G - with optimistic lyrics mentioning 'what a time to be alive'.\nIsn't it just. Robbie notes that the world has gone 'mad' and wants to bring back the carefree fun of the 90s, introducing himself as The King of Entertainment.\nAnd that effortlessly slides him into smash party hit 'Let Me Entertain You'. Some may call Robbie narcissistic, but he's rightfully owned the 'main character energy' title.\nIn his diamante emblazed jacket, matching tailored joggers, a neck full of bling and his silver spiked up hair, the full-package of a performer treated the stage like it was made for him.\nThat's exactly it.\nRobbie is not just a singer, he's a performer and nailed every aspect of it - it's clear by the second song. Even away from the staging, the voice and the dancing, Robbie knows how to charm a crowd with his antics - like placing the microphone on his crotch and mimicking an erection.\nPerhaps pervy if an up and coming musician did that circa 2025, but Robbie is the embodiment of the harmless 'cheeky rascal' behaviour of the 90s and early 00s - and this is the Brit Pop tour after all.\nRobbie reminds us of that by singing a medley from other artists, including Blur's Song 2 and The White Stripes 'Seven Nation Army'.\nBut, before long, it's back to Robbie and him reeling off his impressive roster of hits. He swaps his bedazzled shell jacket for a long red fluffy coat for 'Rock DJ'.\nAnd it didn't take long for the intergenerational crowd to 'move their bodies'. The classic Robbie hit was encased in cheese for years, but it's now fully matured and living a new life of appreciation.\nMuch alike surprise guests Five, who were seen on stage together for the first time in 25 years singing their popular tune 'Keep on Movin', along with Robbie.\nMaybe five years ago it would have been seen as 'cringe' and a 'desperate' attempt of a comeback, but they received a roaring reception from the crowd and, again, rightly so.\nRobbie is right, in a time when the world has gone 'mad' it's time to embrace the fun and be unashamedly 'cringe'. It's a sentiment he touched on while wearing a pink puffy mesh cape and an equally camp coloured suit.\nWhile keeping a straight face in the over-the-top garment, Robbie said: \"I've never been cool. No one has ever said that Robbie Williams is mysterious, no one has looked at me and said 'he reads Bukowski and drinks espressos in silence'.\n\"I tried being cool once and I couldn't pull it off, I just ended up constipated. I'm not the guy in the corner with the cheek bones and the superiority complex.\n\"I'm the guy in the middle of the dancefloor doing the whitest dance moves known to man and trying to sing along to all the songs even if I don't know the f***ing words...\n\"If you're still trying to be cool - STOP IT - it's exhausting. Embrace your cringe.\"\nAnd that's one of the reasons Robbie is still on stadium tours 30 years into his career. He is himself - fun, high-energy, a laugh and someone who doesn't shy away from speaking about their struggles.\nThe mesh cape comes off, and the razzle dazzle comes back out with his rendition of Frank Sinatra's 'New York, New York'.\nRobbie is on top of the world, and you can clearly see how much performing to tens of thousands people means to him - despite him urging that he'll love performing on any sized stage in front of any sized audience.\nBut, even the King of Entertainment doesn't mind sharing his shine. He invites on Thom Rylance from band Lottery Winner for some stripped back versions of his lesser known songs - before finishing with a rendition of 'Relight My Fire'.\nRobbie wasn't playing around on naming his tour Brit Pop. He even roped in Lulu to come out and sing her part in the hit Take That song she featured on.\nHe leant into the past, but also into the future. Throwing digs at TikTok dancing kids and AI, which he welcomed in a hilarious - yet creepy - segment.\nRobbie ended up 'chatting' to a mega-sized version of teen Robbie, who had been under the super computer treatment.\nThe bizarre exchange included digs at Gary Barlow, the England football team and teen Robbie commenting on how he'd never get into drugs or alcohol...\n\"There's this guy in the band, Gary Barlow, amazing 'sing-writer'. I can just tell we're going to be best mates forever like never ever fall-out,\" the AI version quipped.\nRobbie then spoke to a 'future' version of himself, that appeared to have had quite the surgical treatments. The future version of himself joked that he'd been suffering from erectile dysfunction and mentioned that Robbie 'never had the best voice'.\nBut, the performer proved that has never been the case - on the vocal part for certain. He finished the night with a string of emotional numbers, including 'She's The One'.\nRobbie sang the romance song to a fan who had travelled 6,000 miles from China to see him sing live, he made a gag about not realising he had 'cracked' the country.\nThe white suit came our for 'Feel', and so did the pyrotechnics, before finishing the night on everyone's favourite karaoke, wedding and funeral song - 'Angels'.\nHe might not quite have the voice of an angel himself, but we can no longer deny that Robbie 'doesn't have the best voice'.\nIt's just that his excellent ability to perform and engage a crowd with his personality outshines everything else.\nUnfortunately much of the Brit Pop cohort ended up struggling with personal issues, priming them away from the spotlight or pushing them towards the stage of British holiday camps.\nBut, Robbie, his talent and his unapologetic self managed to hoist himself back out of the darkness and back to stadium level once again.\nRobbie Williams put on an unapologetic cringe and campy display that we've been starved of for too long - and let's up he keeps dishing it up.\nStory Saved\nYou can find this story in\nMy Bookmarks.\nOr by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\nFollow\nDaily Star\nComment\nMore On\nExclusives\nRobbie Williams\nSofia Vergara\nSofia Vergara, 52, wears nothing but tiny thong as she sunbathes topless by pool\nModern Family icon Sofia Vergara had her followers hot under the collar with her latest Instagram upload, which showed her enjoying some sunshine by a turquoise pool\nAmanda Holden appears 'completely naked' on radio as Jamie Theakston gobsmacked\nShowbiz\nAmanda Holden made a naked confession as she appeared to go topless in a white gown, after her outfit from the Britain's Got Talent final received a number of Ofcom complaints\nBeloved TV presenter fights back tears on-air as he gives heartbreaking health update\nShowbiz\nJames Whale was hosting his TalkTV show when he made a devastating update about his health, admitting live on air things are getting harder amid his terminal cancer battle\nXena Warrior Princess star dies on 61st birthday as she leaves final message\nTributes\nMarise Wipani, who appeared in Soldier, Soldier and Xena: Warrior Princess, has died at the age of 61, with a post appearing on her Facebook with a parting message\nAmanda Holden, 54, strips to skimpy pink bikini by the pool in dazzling display\nAmanda Holden\nBritain's Got Talent beauty Amanda Holden showed off her killer figure as she strutted around by the pool in a tiny pink bikini to promote skincare brand Revive Collagen\nJeremy Clarkson\nClarkson's Farm fans 'hate everything' about two 'insufferable' stars in latest season\nTwo stars of Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon Prime show Clarkson's Farm were slammed by viewers as they said they 'hated everything' about the auntie-niece duo\nNoel Edmonds signs up to new telly show to prove he's not dead yet\nITV\nAfter decades on the box on shows including Noel\u2019s House Party and Deal or No Deal, Noel Edmonds is hoping viewers will finally get to see the real him in the brand new ITV show\nITV Love Island fans 'sick of it' as they beg bosses to 'ban' show tradition\nLove Island\nLove Island fans were left irritated by a particular moment on Monday's launch show and raced to Twitter to share their anger, as they called for producers to 'ban' the show tradition\nLove Island fans 'confused' after they 'figure out' how they know 'familiar' contestant\nLove Island\nFans were left confused after the contestants entered the Love Island villa in Majorca \u2013 with one contestant appearing to be already well known compared to others\nRebekah Vardy selling 'sanctuary' holiday home for \u00a39.7m after major decision\nColeen Rooney\nRebekah Vardy is selling the 'sanctuary' holiday home in Portugal that helped her through the 'Wagatha Christie' scandal after being ordered to cough up \u00a31.2m in legal fees\nStudents\nUK school closes to pupils as beloved teacher dies suddenly\nJonathan Scott, a teacher at Archbishop Beck Catholic College in Aintree, died yesterday, according to the school's headteacher Paul Stirling\nBonnie Blue banned from adult site as controversial stunt 'crossed the line'\nBonnie Blue\nBonnie Blue has been banned from OnlyFans -

(Ryder System Inc.)\n[Stay on top of transportation news:\nGet TTNews in your inbox\n.]\nRyder System Inc.\nwill begin using real-time commercial fleet roadside assistance technology across Florida as Coral Springs, Fla., software company\nTow4Tech\n\u2019s first major customer.\nMiami-based Ryder is expanding use of the technology after a recent in-state pilot program, Tow4Tech said.\nTow4Tech and Ryder will evaluate further expansion of use as performance data and operational outcomes are measured in the coming months, the company said June 3.\nRyder ranks No. 6\non the\nTransport Topics Top 100 list of the largest for-hire carriers\nin North America, with its Ryder Dedicated Transportation Solutions division ranking\nNo. 5 among truckload carriers\n.\n\u201cThe first phase of our relationship has shown encouraging results towards our goal of reducing downtime and improving the service experience for our customers when they have a roadside event,\u201d said , vice president of maintenance technology at Ryder.\n\u201cTow4Tech brings speed, transparency and automation to a process that has historically lacked all three. Their innovative platform makes it easier for our teams to coordinate roadside assistance, and we\u2019re excited to expand our pilot throughout Florida as they continue to build out their platform,\u201d Dixon added.\nTow4Tech\u2019s platform connects fleet managers and service centers with towing and roadside providers using real-time geolocation, automated dispatching and digital job tracking.\n\u201cTogether, [Ryder and Tow4Tech] are actively developing a technology road map, focusing on enhancing solution efficiency and defining a more streamlined, robust architecture to support future growth,\u201d Tow4Tech said.\n\u200dTow4Tech was founded in 2024 and so far has raised $3.3 million in backing for its ambitions across North America and Europe.\nAt the end of April, the company raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding, a round of backing led by BrightCap Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm based in Sofia, Bulgaria.\nBrian Work of CloneOps.ai discusses where AI agents fit into today\u2019s supply chain workflows and what they might mean for the future of trucking operations.\u00a0Tune in above or by going to\nRoadSigns.ttnews.com\n.\nThat latest funding will enable an expansion of the company\u2019s U.S. network of heavy-duty towing and service providers, accelerate platform development and grow Tow4Tech\u2019s engineering team.\nTow4Tech also is establishing a Romanian division, Tow4Technologies SRL, that will become its European development center and a hub for future expansion across the region.\n\u201cTow4Tech is redefining how roadside assistance works for commercial fleets by bringing a level of speed, transparency and efficiency to a fragmented, manual-heavy process,\u201d said Georgi Mitov, managing partner at BrightCap Ventures.\n\u201cBy replacing the outdated pen-and-paper, phone-based dispatch model with a fully digital platform, they\u2019re creating real operational value for both fleets and tow providers. Their team expansion into Romania further strengthens their ability to scale globally, tapping into our region\u2019s exceptional engineering talent and setting the stage for European growth,\u201d Mitov added.\nMinimizing downtime on the side of the road or the back of a tow truck is a key cost metric for fleets, with more modern solutions multiplying as truck technology improves,\nincluding through mobile repairs\n, transport-as-a-service options and original equipment manufacturer\nremote software updates\n.\nWant more news?\nListen to today's daily briefing below\nor go here for more info:\nMore Content About:\nRyder System\nRelated Articles\nRyder Buys Mobile Maintenance Firm Pit Stop Fleet Service\nHow Shippers Navigate Risk in a Fragmented Freight Market\nRyder Q1 Profit Rises 15.3% on Higher Contract Revenue\nFollow Us\nYouTube\nThis site (RSS)\nTrending\n1\nTariffs, Uncertainty Offer 3PLs a Rare Opportunity\n2\nCVSA to Enforce English Tests for Truck Drivers Starting June 25\n3\nCyberattack at United Natural Foods Affects Orders\n4\nFleet Margins Set to Shrink Again in 2025, CSCMP Finds\n5\nCargo Theft Gets More Sophisticated, Experts Warn\nNewsletter Signup\nSubscribe to Transport Topics\nSubscribe\nGift a Subscription\nHot Topics\ntariffs\nDonald Trump\nLTL\nlast-mile delivery\nCSCMP\nCVSA", "ped_digest": "P:Real-time roadside assistance|Reducing downtime|Improving service experience|Technology road map|Streamlined architecture;E:Ryder and Tow4Tech partnership expansion in Florida|Pilot program showing encouraging results|Tow4Tech raising funding|Establishment of Romanian division;D:$3.3 million raised|$1.5 million pre-seed funding|Ryder ranks No. 6 on Transport Topics Top 100|Ryder Dedicated Transportation Solutions ranks No. 5 among truckload carriers;", "er_digest": "N:Ryder System Inc.|Jenn Dixon;R:Europe|Florida|Coral Springs|Miami|Romania|Bulgaria|North America;", "gist": "P:Real-time roadside assistance|Reducing downtime|Improving service experience|Technology road map|Streamlined architecture;E:Ryder and Tow4Tech partnership expansion in Florida|Pilot program showing encouraging results|Tow4Tech raising funding|Establishment of Romanian division;D:$3.3 million raised|$1.5 million pre-seed funding|Ryder ranks No. 6 on Transport Topics Top 100|Ryder Dedicated Transportation Solutions ranks No. 5 among truckload carriers;N:Ryder System Inc.|Jenn Dixon;R:Europe|Florida|Coral Springs|Miami|Romania|Bulgaria|North America;", "entities": ["Ryder System Inc.", "Jenn Dixon"], "regions": ["Europe", "Florida", "Coral Springs", "Miami", "Romania", "Bulgaria", "North America"]}, {"_id": "https://thecurrentga.org/2025/06/09/charlton-county-ice-contract-to-expand-processing-center-moves-forward/", "content": "Let's get there together\nSubscribe today\nand have the latest stories from\nThe Current\ndelivered directly to your inbox.\nSupport Our Work\nWe rely on you, the readers to fund our journalism.\nOur stories are your stories:\nSign up for our newsletters focused on Savannah and Coastal Georgia, local politics, environment, public safety and more.\nDelivered Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday to your inbox.\nSign up now.\nProcessing\u2026\nSuccess!

Ray James Correctional Facility in Folkston, 45 miles southwest of Brunswick, will be merged with an immigrant processing center in the city that is operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nCoastal Georgia Congressman Earl \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter, who said he helped broker the contract, praised the deal.\nThe expansion will add \u201croughly 400 jobs and economic growth to the First Congressional District,\u201d Carter said in a\npress release\n.\nContinued Carter, who last month announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Jon Ossoff: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have worked with Charlton County to get the D. Ray James Correctional Facility expansion over the finish line, which will bring jobs and economic growth to our region, and I will continue to support our brave ICE agents as they seek to restore law and order.\u201d\nFolkston, a city of about 4,500 people, will also receive approximately $600,000 a year in revenue from water and sewer services to the facility, the congressman said.\nThe Folkston processing center currently holds just over 1,100 beds. Its merger with the correctional facility will bring the center\u2019s total capacity to nearly 3,000 beds.\nIn a June 5\npress release\nfrom the county\u2019s Board of Commissioners, County Administrator Glenn Hull said the county does not manage the correctional facility and would not do so following the merger.\n\u201cThis expansion would increase capacity and enhance federal operations already in place,\u201d Hull wrote in the press release. \u201cCharlton County\u2019s role remains strictly administrative and supportive.\u201d\nBoth facilities are owned and managed by The Geo Group, a private prison corporation. The Geo Group\ncontributed\n$7,500 to Carter\u2019s campaign in 2024 through PACs, $5,000 of which was donated directly to\nBuddy PAC\n\u2014 Carter\u2019s Leadership PAC.\nRelated\nType of Story: News\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\nTyler Davis\nBusiness Reporting Fellow\nBusiness Reporting Fellow\ntyler.thecurrent@gmail.com\nTyler Davis is a senior set to graduate in December from American University with a degree in journalism and literature.

He\u2019d address potential weakness\nUpdated: Jun. 09, 2025, 5:23 p.m.\n|\nPublished: Jun. 09, 2025, 4:01 p.m.\nBy\nCayden Steele | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\nIn his first season (2024) as the Eagles\u2019 defensive coordinator,\nVic Fangio\nhelped a group of young players, including cornerbacks\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean\n, develop into good starters and backups for the NFL\u2019s best defense.\nDuring his second season with the Eagles (2025), Fangio will rely on more young guys after losing five defensive starters and two backups this offseason, creating potential problems. He might not receive great production out of his new starters, including cornerback\nKelee Ringo\n.\nRingo is one of two cornerbacks \u2014 the other being veteran\nAdoree\u2019 Jackson\n\u2014 battling to replace\nDarius Slay\n, who was released in March and signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nThe 22-year-old has only started five games during the first two years of his career (2023-2024), not proving much.\nIf Ringo plays poorly in his first year as a starter, the Eagles\u2019 defense could regress, hurting the team\u2019s chances of winning back-to-back Super Bowls.\nThe Eagles\ncould solve that concern by signing former Green Bay Packers cornerback\nJaire Alexander\n, .\nAlexander, who has made second-team All-Pro twice, has been of the league\u2019s best cornerbacks since getting drafted in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. But after dealing with injuries in three of the last four years, Alexander\u2019s body could be battered, ruining his ability.\nDespite having a concerning injury history (19 games missed in the last two years), the 28-year-old will still command significant money, with so many teams needing to sign a starting cornerback.\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman should at least discuss the idea of signing Alexander even though he comes with a major risk. He would be an upgrade over Ringo and could make Philadelphia\u2019s secondary better than last year\u2019s elite unit.\nStill, it\u2019s more likely that Philadelphia goes into the season with Ringo starting and with Jackson as the top backup, or vice versa.\nThe Eagles probably won\u2019t spend a substantial amount of money on an oft-injured cornerback, but plenty of NFL teams might be willing to do that. The Minnesota Vikings, Los Angeles Rams, among other organizations, could aggressively pursue Alexander to fix their cornerback issues.\nAlexander could become the No. 1 CB for those defenses, maintaining his reputation as an elite player, but he might not be considered Philadelphia\u2019s top cornerback since DeJean and Mitchell both demonstrated All-Pro upside last season. If he cares about being in that role still, the Eagles might not be his first choice.\nHe could also experience more health problems this season, a situation the Eagles could get frustrated with. Fangio might also worry that Alexander\u2019s poor tackling \u2014 his 38.5 percent missed-tackle rate was the worst for any cornerback in the NFL last season \u2014 will make a tough Eagles\u2019 defense less physical and more sloppy.\nDeJean, the Eagles\u2019 star nickelback, can play a large amount of snaps on the outside and would be able to take over for a struggling Ringo. That option makes Alexander less of a priority.\nEven though Alexander excels in zone coverage and has great ball skills (12 career interceptions),him being undersized (5-10, 196 pounds) and frequently injured could be too tough for the Eagles to overlook.\nAlexander could sign with another team quickly, but it probably won\u2019t be Philadelphia for multiple reasons, including the team\u2019s philosophy of playing young draft picks.\nMORE EAGLES COVERAGE\nHere\u2019s where you can get your very own NFL training camp headwear | Eagles, Giants, Jets, more\nJordon Hudson\u2019s recent DMs revealed amid Bill Belichick spotlight\nEx-Eagles player feels \u2018highly disrespected\u2019 about trade\nAaron Rodgers is a better bargain than Giants QB bust, analyst says\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

It would be the first time in nearly 40 years that the congressionally chartered school would not receive federal support, said Robert Martin, the school\u2019s president.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t wipe out 63 years of our history and what we\u2019ve accomplished with one budget,\u201d Martin said on Friday. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand or comprehend why they would do something like this.\u201d\nThe college, founded in 1962, has provided affordable education to thousands of Native artists and culture bearers, including U.S. poet laureate Joy Harjo, painter T.C. Cannon and bestselling novelist Tommy Orange. It\u2019s the only four-year degree fine arts institution in the world devoted to contemporary Native American and Alaskan Native arts, according to its website.\nMartin said he has spoken with members of Congress from both major political parties who have assured him they\u2019ll work to keep the institute\u2019s budget level for the next fiscal year, but he worries the morale of students and staff will be affected. Martin said he also spoke with staff in the office of U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Cole, a Republican and former member of IAIA\u2019s board of trustees and a longtime advocate in Congress for funding that supports tribal citizens, was unavailable for comment.\nBreana Brave Heart, a junior studying arts and business, said the proposal shocked her and made her wonder: \u201cWill I be able to continue my education at IAIA with these budget cuts?\u201d Brave Heart said she started organizing with other students to contact members of Congress. \u201cIAIA is under attack,\u201d she said, \u201dand I need other students to know this.\u201d\nMartin said that amid the Republican Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on federal policies and funding that support\ndiversity, equity and inclusion\n, trust responsibilities and treaty rights owed to tribal nations have also come under attack.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem for us and many other organizations when you\u2019ve got that DEI initiative which really is not applicable to us, because we\u2019re not a racial category, we\u2019re a political status as a result of the treaties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re easily identified as what this administration might refer to as a \u2018woke\u2019.\u201d\nDemocratic Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico said the cuts are another example of the Trump administration \u201cturning its back on Native communities and breaking our trust responsibilities.\u201d\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I remain committed to keeping IAIA fully funded and will continue working with appropriators and the New Mexico Congressional Delegation to ensure its future,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said in a statement to The Associated Press.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe congressional budget bill includes roughly\n$3.75 trillion in tax cuts\n, extending the expiring 2017 individual income tax breaks and temporarily adding new ones that Trump campaigned on. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance.\nA Jan. 30 order from the Interior Department titled \u201cEnding DEI Programs and Gender Ideology Extremism\u201d stated that any efforts to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion in the department\u2019s policy should exclude trust obligations to tribal nations.\nHowever, earlier this year, several staff members at the other two congressionally chartered schools in the country \u2014 the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas \u2014 were laid off as part of Trump\u2019s push to downsize the federal workforce. In\na lawsuit\nfiled in March, both institutions reported that some staff and faculty were rehired, but the Bureau of Indian Education notified those people that might be temporary and they may be laid off again.\n\u201cIt shows what a president\u2019s values and priorities are, and that\u2019s been hard,\u201d said Ahniwake Rose, president of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, an organization that represents more than 30 Tribal Colleges and Universities. \u201cThat\u2019s been hard for our staff, our students, our faculty to see that the priority of the administration through the Department of Interior might not be on tribal colleges.\u201d\nIn its budget request this year, the Interior Department is proposing reducing funding to the BIE\u2019s post secondary programs by more than 80%, and that would have a devastating affect on tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs, which rely on the federal government for most of their funding, said Rose. Most TCUs offer tribal citizens a tuition-free higher education, she said, and funding them is a moral and fiduciary responsibility the federal government owes tribal nations.\nIn the many treaties the U.S. signed with tribal nations, it outlined several rights owed to them \u2014 like land rights, health care and education through departments established later, like the BIE.\nTrust responsibilities\nare the legal and moral obligations the U.S. has to protect and uphold those rights.\nThe Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.\nBy using this site, you consent to our\nUser Agreement\nand agree that your clicks, interactions, and personal information may be collected, recorded, and/or stored by us and social media and other third-party partners in accordance with our\nPrivacy Policy.", "ped_digest": "P:Budget cuts proposed for tribal colleges and universities|Institute for American Indian Arts funding threatened|$3.75 trillion in tax cuts proposed|Reduced federal spending proposed|Interior Department order on DEI programs|TCUs rely on federal funding|Trust responsibilities owed to tribal nationsE:White House budget request released|Congress to consider budget proposal|Robert Martin speaks out against budget cuts|Breana Brave Heart organizes student response|Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n criticizes budget cuts|Staff layoffs at Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute and Haskell Indian Nations University|Ahniwake Rose expresses concern over TCU fundingD:More than $13 million in annual appropriations for IAIA at risk|IAIA founded in 1962|Joy Harjo is a U.S. poet laureate|Tommy Orange is a bestselling novelist|$1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending|Jan. 30 order from Interior Department|BIE post secondary programs facing over 80% funding reduction;", "er_digest": "N:Tommy Orange|Associated Press|Ahniwake Rose|Joy Harjo|Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute|Tom Cole|Breana Brave Heart|Haskell Indian Nations University|Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n|Bureau of Indian Education|Robert Martin|Donald Trump|T.C.

The singers screeched, chanted, crooned and hollered. The music was a blowout of frantic horns, rapid-fire guitar and locomotive rhythms, a melting pot of jazz, psychedelic rock, doo-wop, soul and the early grooves of funk.\nMore Music\nArticle content\nSly\u2019s time on top was brief, roughly from 1968-1971, but profound. No band better captured the gravity-defying euphoria of the Woodstock era or more bravely addressed the crash which followed. From early songs as rousing as their titles \u2014 \u201cI Want To Take You Higher,\u201d \u201cStand!\u201d \u2014 to the sober aftermath of \u201cFamily Affair\u201d and \u201cRunnin\u2019 Away,\u201d Sly and the Family Stone spoke for a generation whether or not it liked what they had to say.\nAdvertisement 3\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nStone\u2019s group began as a Bay Area sextet featuring Sly on keyboards, Larry Graham on bass; Sly\u2019s brother, Freddie, on guitar; sister Rose on vocals; Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini horns and Greg Errico on drums. They debuted with the album \u201cA Whole New Thing\u201d and earned the title with their breakthrough single, \u201cDance to the Music.\u201d It hit the top 10 in April 1968, the week the Rev. Martin Luther King was murdered, and helped launch an era when the polish of Motown and the understatement of Stax suddenly seemed of another time.\nLed by Sly Stone, with his leather jumpsuits and goggle shades, mile-wide grin and mile-high Afro, the band dazzled in 1969 at the Woodstock festival and set a new pace on the radio. \u201cEveryday People,\u201d \u201cI Wanna Take You Higher\u201d and other songs were anthems of community, non-conformity and a brash and hopeful spirit, built around such catchphrases as \u201cdifferent strokes for different folks.\u201d The group released five top 10 singles, three of them hitting No. 1, and three million-selling albums: \u201cStand!\u201d, \u201cThere\u2019s a Riot Goin\u2019 On\u201d and \u201cGreatest Hits.\u201d\nYour Midday Sun\nYour noon-hour look at what's happening in Toronto and beyond.\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\nThanks for signing up!\nA welcome email is on its way.

The Jackson Five\u2019s breakthrough hit, \u201cI Want You Back,\u201d and the Temptations\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Next to You\u201d were among the many songs from the late 1960s that mimicked Sly\u2019s vocal and instrumental arrangements. Miles Davis\u2019 landmark blend of jazz, rock and funk, \u201cBitches Brew,\u201d was inspired in part by Sly, while fellow jazz artist Herbie Hancock even named a song after him.\n\u201cHe had a way of talking, moving from playful to earnest at will. He had a look, belts, and hats and jewelry,\u201d Questlove wrote in the foreword to Stone\u2019s memoir, \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\u201d named for one of his biggest hits and published through Questlove\u2019s imprint in 2023. \u201cHe was a special case, cooler than everything around him by a factor of infinity.\u201d\nAdvertisement 5\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nIn 2025, Questlove released the documentary \u201cSly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius).\u201d\nSly\u2019s influence has endured for decades. The top funk artist of the 1970s, Parliament-Funkadelic creator George Clinton, was a Stone disciple. Prince, Rick James and the Black Eyed Peas were among the many performers from the 1980s and after shaped in part by Sly, and countless hip-hop artists have sampled his riffs, from the Beastie Boys to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. A 2005 tribute record included Maroon 5, John Legend and the Roots.\n\u201cSly did so many things so well that he turned my head all the way around,\u201d Clinton once wrote. \u201cHe could create polished R&B that sounded like it came from an act that had gigged at clubs for years, and then in the next breath he could be as psychedelic as the heaviest rock band.\u201d\nAdvertisement 6\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nA dream dies, a career burns away\nBy the early \u201970s, Stone himself was beginning a descent from which he never recovered, driven by the pressures of fame and the added burden of Black fame. His record company was anxious for more hits, while the Black Panthers were pressing him to drop the white members from his group. After moving from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in 1970, he became increasingly hooked on cocaine and erratic in his behavior. A promised album, \u201cThe Incredible and Unpredictable Sly and the Family Stone\u201d (\u201cThe most optimistic of all,\u201d Rolling Stone reported) never appeared. He became notorious for being late to concerts or not showing up at all, often leaving \u201cother band members waiting backstage for hours wondering whether he was going to show up or not,\u201d according to Stone biographer Joel Selvin.\nAdvertisement 7\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nAround the country, separatism and paranoia were setting in. As a turn of the calendar, and as a state of mind, the \u201960s were over. \u201cThe possibility of possibility was leaking out,\u201d Stone later explained in his memoir.\nOn \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),\u201d Stone had warned: \u201cDying young is hard to take/selling out is harder.\u201d Late in 1971, he released \u201cThere\u2019s a Riot Going On,\u201d one of the grimmest, most uncompromising records ever to top the album charts. The sound was dense and murky (Sly was among the first musicians to use drum machines), the mood reflective (\u201cFamily Affair\u201d), fearful (\u201cRunnin\u2019 Away\u201d) and despairing: \u201cTime, they say, is the answer _ but I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Sly sings on \u201cTime.\u201d The fast, funky pace of the original \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\u201d was slowed, stretched and retitled \u201cThank You For Talkin\u2019 to Me, Africa.\u201d\nAdvertisement 8\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nThe running time of the title track was 0:00.\n\u201cIt is Muzak with its finger on the trigger,\u201d critic Greil Marcus called the album.\n\u201cRiot\u201d highlighted an extraordinary run of blunt, hard-hitting records by Black artists, from the Stevie Wonder single \u201cSuperstition\u201d to Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d album, to which \u201cRiot\u201d was an unofficial response. But Stone seemed to back away from the nightmare he had related. He was reluctant to perform material from \u201cRiot\u201d in concert and softened the mood on the acclaimed 1973 album \u201cFresh,\u201d which did feature a cover of \u201cQue Sera Sera,\u201d the wistful Doris Day song reworked into a rueful testament to fate\u2019s upper hand.\nBy the end of the decade, Sly and the Family Stone had broken up and Sly was releasing solo records with such unmet promises as \u201cHeard You Missed Me, Well I\u2019m Back\u201d and \u201cBack On the Right Track.\u201d Most of the news he made over the following decades was of drug busts, financial troubles and mishaps on stage. Sly and the Family Stone was inducted into the Rock & Roll of Fame in 1993 and honored in 2006 at the Grammy Awards, but Sly released just one album after the early \u201980s, \u201cI\u2019m Back! Family & Friends,\u201d much of it updated recordings of his old hits.\nAdvertisement 9\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nHe would allege he had hundreds of unreleased songs and did collaborate on occasion with Clinton, who would recall how Stone \u201ccould just be sitting there doing nothing and then open his eyes and shock you with a lyric so brilliant that it was obvious no one had ever thought of it before.\u201d\nSly Stone had three children, including a daughter with Cynthia Robinson, and was married once \u2014 briefly and very publicly. In 1974, he and actor Kathy Silva wed on stage at Madison Square Garden, an event that inspired an 11,000-word story in The New Yorker. Sly and Silva soon divorced.\nA born musician, a born uniter\nHe was born Sylvester Stewart in Denton, Texas, and raised in Vallejo, California, the second of five children in a close, religious family. Sylvester became \u201cSly\u201d by accident, when a teacher mistakenly spelled his name \u201cSlyvester.\u201d\nAdvertisement 10\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nHe loved performing so much that his mother alleged he would cry if the congregation in church didn\u2019t respond when he sang before it. He was so gifted and ambitious that by age 4 he had sung on stage at a Sam Cooke show and by age 11 had mastered several instruments and recorded a gospel song with his siblings. He was so committed to the races working together that in his teens and early 20s he was playing in local bands that included Black and white members and was becoming known around the Bay Area as a deejay equally willing to play the Beatles and rhythm and blues acts.\nThrough his radio connections, he produced some of the top San Francisco bands, including the Great Society, Grace Slick\u2019s group before she joined the Jefferson Airplane. Along with an early mentor and champion, San Francisco deejay Tom \u201cBig Daddy\u201d Donahue, he worked on rhythm and blues hits (Bobby Freeman\u2019s \u201cC\u2019mon and Swim\u201d) and the Beau Brummels\u2019 Beatle-esque \u201cLaugh, Laugh.\u201d Meanwhile, he was putting together his own group, recruiting family members and local musicians and settling on the name Sly and the Family Stone.\nAdvertisement 11\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\n\u201cA Whole New Thing\u201d came out in 1967, soon followed by the single \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d in which each member was granted a moment of introduction as the song rightly proclaimed a \u201cbrand new beat.\u201d In December 1968, the group appeared on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d and performed a medley that included \u201cDance to the Music\u201d and \u201cEveryday People.\u201d Before the set began, Sly turned to the audience and recited a brief passage from his song \u201cAre You Ready\u201d:\n\u201cDon\u2019t hate the Black, don\u2019t hate the white, if you get bitten, just hate the bite.\u201d\nLove concerts, but can't make it to the venue?

Drawing parallels between the structured yet dynamic nature of hive communities and philosophical networks, this study examines how philosopher-practitioners function as essential pollinators of ideas, transferring conceptual frameworks, methodologies, and theoretical insights between disparate fields to promote societal advancement. Through analysis of historical and contemporary examples, this research demonstrates that philosophers serve as critical intermediaries in the knowledge ecosystem, much like bees facilitate plant reproduction through their systematic movement between flowers. The paper argues that understanding this symbiotic relationship is essential for optimizing intellectual collaboration and fostering innovation in an increasingly interconnected world.\nCite\nPlain

parallels between ant colony organization and university academic structures, with particular emphasis on philosophy's role as the foundational discipline that maintains academic cohesion. Through comparative analysis of collective intelligence, specialization, communication systems, and adaptive resilience, this study demonstrates how both ant colonies and academic institutions operate as complex adaptive systems. The research reveals that philosophy functions analogously to the chemical communication systems in ant colonies, providing the conceptual framework and methodological foundation that enables coordination across diverse academic specializations. These findings suggest that understanding ant colony dynamics can inform approaches to academic governance, interdisciplinary collaboration, and institutional resilience in higher education.\nCite\nPlain text\nBibTeX\nFormatted text\nZotero\nEndNote\nReference Manager\nRefWorks\nOptions\nEdit\nMark as duplicate\nFind it on Scholar\nRequest removal from index\nRevision history\nView on PhilPapers\nAuthor's Profile\nOlivier Boether\nArchival history\nArchival date: 2025-06-09\nView all versions\nCategories\nCommunication\nin\nSocial Sciences\nEducation\nin\nProfessional Areas\nNatural Sciences, Misc\nin\nNatural Sciences\nPhilosophy, Misc\nPsychology\nin\nCognitive Sciences\nSociology\nin\nSocial Sciences\nKeywords\ncollective intelligence, academic organization, philosophy, institutional dynamics, complex adaptive systems, education, psychology, philosophy\nReprint years\nAnalytics\nAdded to PP\nyesterday\nDownloads\n0\n6 months\n0\nHistorical graph of downloads since first upload\nSorry, there are not enough data points to plot this chart.\nHow can I increase my downloads?\nloading ..\nApplied ethics\nEpistemology\nHistory of Western Philosophy\nMeta-ethics\nMetaphysics\nNormative ethics\nPhilosophy of biology\nPhilosophy of language\nPhilosophy of mind\nPhilosophy of religion\nScience Logic and Mathematics\nMore ...\nHome\n|\nBibliographies\n|\nAbout PhilArchive\n|\nContact us\n|\nCode of conduct\nPhilPapers logo by\nAndrea Andrews\nand\nMeghan Driscoll\n.\nThis site uses cookies and Google Analytics (see our\nterms & conditions\nfor details regarding the privacy implications). \nUse of this site is subject to\nterms & conditions\n.\nAll rights reserved by\nThe PhilPapers Foundation\nServer: philpapers-web-fff64949b-gsm5k uwo", "ped_digest": "P:Parallels between ant colony organization and university academic structures|Philosophy's role as foundational discipline|Complex adaptive systems|Conceptual framework for coordination|Institutional resilience;E:Comparative analysis of collective intelligence|Specialization|Communication systems|Adaptive resilience;D:Research reveals philosophy functions analogously to chemical communication in ant colonies|Keywords: collective intelligence, academic organization, philosophy, institutional dynamics, complex adaptive systems, education, psychology, philosophy;", "er_digest": "N:PhilPapers|Olivier Boether;", "gist": "P:Parallels between ant colony organization and university academic structures|Philosophy's role as foundational discipline|Complex adaptive systems|Conceptual framework for coordination|Institutional resilience;E:Comparative analysis of collective intelligence|Specialization|Communication systems|Adaptive resilience;D:Research reveals philosophy functions analogously to chemical communication in ant colonies|Keywords: collective intelligence, academic organization, philosophy, institutional dynamics, complex adaptive systems, education, psychology, philosophy;N:PhilPapers|Olivier Boether;", "entities": ["PhilPapers", "Olivier Boether"], "regions": null}, {"_id": "https://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2025/06/09/331063.htm", "content": "Skip to content\nInsurance Journal\nInsurance Journal TV\nAcademy of Insurance\nMyNewMarkets.com\nCarrier Management\nFeatured Stories\nFixing the Claims Experience Where It Matters The Most\nCars Are Getting Smarter. Why It Matters for Claims Pros\nHedge Funds Face California Rebuke Over Wildfire Claims\nJudge Dismisses Justin Baldoni\u2019s $400M Suit Against Costar Blake Lively\nJune 9, 2025\nEmail This\nSubscribe to Newsletter\nEmail to a friend\nPrint Article\nArticle\n0 Comments\nA judge on Monday dismissed the lawsuit filed by actor and director Justin Baldoni against his \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar Blake Lively after she sued him for sexual harassment and retaliation.\nU.S. District Court Judge Lewis Liman\u2019s decision is the latest development in the bitter legal battle surrounding the dark romantic drama that includes Lively suing Baldoni in late December.\nBaldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios countersued in January for $400 million, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion.\nThe judge ruled that Baldoni can\u2019t sue Lively for defamation over claims she made in her lawsuit, because allegations made in a lawsuit are exempt from libel claims. Liman also ruled that Baldoni\u2019s claims that Lively stole creative control of the film didn\u2019t count as extortion under California law.\nWhile Lively was accused in the lawsuit of threatening to refuse to promote the film, Wayfarer does \u201cnot allege facts showing that Lively had an obligation to promote the film or to approve marketing materials,\u201d Liman wrote.\nBaldoni\u2019s legal team can revise the lawsuit if they want to pursue different claims related to whether Lively breached a contract, the judge said.\n\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.\nThe judge also dismissed Baldoni\u2019s defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which had reported on Lively\u2019s sexual harassment allegations.\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, (publicist) Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,\u201d Lively\u2019s attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, said in a prepared statement.\nThe lawyers said they \u201clook forward to the next round\u201d of seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages.\nThe Associated Press sent emails seeking comment to Baldoni\u2019s attorneys.\nLively appeared in the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u201d and the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012 before starring in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d\nBaldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book challenging traditional notions of masculinity.\nCopyright 2025 Associated Press.

That was under the Mulroney government at the end of the Cold War and after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the USSR, interest in defence spending faded away like Soviet communism.\nWe got lazy, we became complacent, we relied too heavily on the Americans, and we believed no one would want to harm us, that is if they could reach us.\n\u201cThe long-held view that Canada\u2019s geographic location will protect us is becoming increasingly archaic. Threats which felt far away and remote are now immediate and acute. And as our climate changes and the polar ice recedes Canada\u2019s arctic is becoming more accessible and more vulnerable,\u201d Carney said.\nYour Midday Sun\nYour noon-hour look at what's happening in Toronto and beyond.\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\nThanks for signing up!\nA welcome email is on its way.

Some of that will happen by moving existing government spending to the defence budget, so there isn\u2019t really an increase.\nFor example, the Canadian Coast Guard is currently part of Fisheries and Oceans to the Department of National Defence along with its current $4.5-billion budget. The Coast Guard will then also have additional duties \u201cto better secure our sovereignty and expand maritime surveillance.\u201d\nThere will also be a push to boost Canada\u2019s defence industrial capacity with contracts in areas like light armoured vehicles, ammunitions and more going to Canadian companies. On this front, Carney described the spending as increasing defence spending while also supporting good paying jobs in Canadian industries.\nAdvertisement 4\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\n\u201cWe will ensure that every dollar is invested wisely, including by prioritizing made-in-Canada manufacturing and supply chains,\u201d Carney said.\nThere are real questions about whether DND can spend this much money and do it wisely.\nThe Canadian Armed Forces are currently short almost 15,000 active-duty members. Recruitment has been a problem for the past several years, but so has retention as members leave in droves.\nA pay boost that will be part of this increase in defence spending should help with recruitment. Having up-to-date equipment instead of antiquated or broken equipment should help. In his remarks Monday, Carney noted that only one of our four submarines is seaworthy.\nRead More\nEDITORIAL: Meeting NATO's 2% target the right move\nCanada will meet 2% NATO spending pledge this year: Carney\nAdvertisement 5\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nHow can a country like Canada operate a navy with just one working sub?\nTo really increase recruitment the military doesn\u2019t necessarily need to spend more money, but they do need a culture change. They need to drop the woke mentality that has seen the Royal Canadian Navy push to drop Heart of Oak as their march song.\nThe 2% pledge comes now; expect Carney to announce future increases either just before or at the NATO meetings taking place June 24-25 in The Hague. It\u2019s all part of trying to secure a new deal with the United States under President Donald Trump.\nWhile Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S. was subsidizing Canada were mostly false, on defence it was true.

While Donald Trump and RFK, Jr. continue to sit on their hands, I\u2019ll keep showing up, listening to the families, and fighting to hold the Trump administration to account so Milwaukee gets the support it deserves.\u201d\nSenator Baldwin meets with impacted families of Milwaukee School closures due to lead exposure\nBaldwin\u2019s visit comes as she continues to hold the Trump Administration accountable for failing to support Milwaukee, firing the entire Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Surveillance Branch, and not providing on-the-ground support to keep children safe.\nIn early April, the Centers for Disease Control notified MPS that they would not be able to receive on-site help from lead experts because the Trump administration shut down the lead poisoning branch and fired the experts. The crisis has shuttered six schools and displaced 1,800 children in Milwaukee. Senator Baldwin has repeatedly\npressed\nthe Administration to reinstate fired experts and approve Milwaukee\u2019s plea for federal assistance.\nAn online version of this release is available\nhere\n.\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nUpcoming Events\nJun\n20\nFeatured\n11:30 am\n-\n1:00 pm\nRefining Wisconsin\u2019s voting administration ahead of the \u201926 elections\nJun\n24\nFeatured\n11:30 am\n-\n1:00 pm\nWisPolitics Luncheon with Attorney General Josh Kaul\nSep\n24\nFeatured\n11:45 am\n-\n1:15 pm\nNewsmaker Luncheon with MPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius\nOct\n2\nFeatured\n11:45 am\n-\n1:15 pm\nNewsmaker Luncheon with Milwaukee\u00a0Archbishop\u00a0Jeffrey Scott Grob\nView Calendar\nOrder copies of the WisPolitics 2025 Directory today", "ped_digest": "P:Milwaukee families impacted by school closures due to lead exposure|Senator Baldwin holds Trump administration accountable for lack of support|Lead poisoning crisis affects 1,800 children|Federal assistance denied due to branch shutdown and expert firings;E:Senator Baldwin meets with impacted families|Milwaukee Public Schools' Frances Starms Discovery Learning Center visit|Centers for Disease Control denies on-site help to MPS|Six schools shuttered and 1,800 children displaced;D:1,800 children displaced|Six schools shuttered|April: CDC notified MPS of denial|Early April: Trump administration shut down lead poisoning branch;", "er_digest": "N:Jeffrey Scott Grob|Centers for Disease Control|Tammy Baldwin|Donald Trump|Brenda Cassellius|RFK, Jr.;R:Milwaukee|United States|Wisconsin;", "gist": "P:Milwaukee families impacted by school closures due to lead exposure|Senator Baldwin holds Trump administration accountable for lack of support|Lead poisoning crisis affects 1,800 children|Federal assistance denied due to branch shutdown and expert firings;E:Senator Baldwin meets with impacted families|Milwaukee Public Schools' Frances Starms Discovery Learning Center visit|Centers for Disease Control denies on-site help to MPS|Six schools shuttered and 1,800 children displaced;D:1,800 children displaced|Six schools shuttered|April: CDC notified MPS of denial|Early April: Trump administration shut down lead poisoning branch;N:Jeffrey Scott Grob|Centers for Disease Control|Tammy Baldwin|Donald Trump|Brenda Cassellius|RFK, Jr.;R:Milwaukee|United States|Wisconsin;", "entities": ["Jeffrey Scott Grob", "Centers for Disease Control", "Tammy Baldwin", "Donald Trump", "Brenda Cassellius", "RFK, Jr."], "regions": ["Milwaukee", "United States", "Wisconsin"]}, {"_id": "https://www.wispolitics.com/2025/never-out-of-the-fight-pac-tony-evers-enabling-the-invasion-of-illegal-immigrants-and-violent-protests/", "content": "Never Out of the Fight PAC: Tony Evers enabling the invasion of illegal immigrants and violent protests\nJune 9, 2025\nHome\n\u00bb\nPress Releases\n\u00bb\nNever Out of the Fight PAC: Tony Evers enabling the invasion of illegal immigrants and violent protests\nWISCONSIN \u2013\nBill Berrien, a Navy SEAL veteran and Chairman of the Never Out of the Fight PAC, responded to a\nletter\n, signed by every Democrat Governor in the United States, denouncing President Trump\u2019s decision to send the National Guard to contain the violent anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles.\nREAD:\nViolent protests have erupted in the streets of Los Angeles, as agitators burn vehicles and vandalize small businesses over President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to put an end to illegal immigration into the United States.\nOn Monday, Berrien released the following statement condemning Evers for supporting the unlawful, violent protests across Los Angeles.\n\u201cGovernor Tony Evers and California Governor Gavin Newsom are actively enabling the invasion of illegal immigrants and violent protests.

I recently ran across a cartoon that caught my attention. Most everyone is familiar with the character of Winnie the Pooh. In the cartoon, Pooh is walking along with his good friend, Piglet.\nPooh turns to Piglet and asks, \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d Piglet answers, \u201cIt\u2019s today!\u201d To which Pooh replies, \u201cAhh, my favorite day.\u201d\nToday. Not yesterday. Not tomorrow. But today. WisconsinEye is grateful for today because we are privileged for the opportunity to once again bring you another day of State Capitol coverage and award-winning civic programming. More on today in a moment, but first a few words about yesterday and tomorrow.\nWisconsinEye has experienced many favorite yesterdays \u2013in fact, 17 years of them and thousands of hours of delivering reliable, bipartisan, unedited, free, live, archived, spin-free, accurate, always available coverage of your state government. It\u2019s a remarkable record of public service.\nTomorrow, we envision an even more robust network, with additional State Capitol coverage, enhanced viewer experience, new programming that fosters civil dialogue, and a classroom initiative that inspires learning about government and a young person\u2019s role in civil society. Our vision for a bigger, better tomorrow is thanks to a bipartisan act of the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor Evers who presented the network with a matching grant challenge, to build a permanent endowment. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunity.\nToday, however, WisconsinEye is faced with a challenge unlike anything before. We are an independent, non-profit State Capitol network \u2013 the first of its kind in the country and a model that inspires bipartisanship, trustworthiness, and equal treatment of all sides and all voices.\nWe rely upon charitable donations for our day-to-day operations. The current fundraising environment is extremely challenging, and we need your help to keep WisconsinEye operating at full speed.\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: \u00a0We need to\nraise $500,000\nby mid-August in order to meet our budgetary needs for the remainder of 2025.\nSimple math tells us that if each of the 115,000 unique visitors to the WisconsinEye website in the last 12 months were to donate just $4.38 we would reach our goal. But it\u2019s never that easy.\nIt\u2019s going to take generous donors at every level, but especially those who are capable of doing more. And we\u2019re looking for a few champions who will go the extra mile.\nWisconsinEye is a no-frills, streamlined organization. Every dollar donated is maximized for impact.\nEvery tax-deductible gift makes a difference.\nWe need your support to continue providing award-winning WisconsinEye programming.\n$500,000 is just a fraction \u2026 and I do mean a fraction of the millions and millions of dollars that flowed into political campaigns over the last two election cycles in Wisconsin.\nIf electing individuals to public office can generate that level of support, we ask this question:\nShould there be interest in investing just a fraction of that amount to provide citizens with unfettered access to the actions of those elected officials as they act on billions of dollars of taxpayer spending, and vital policy issues that impact every person, business, school, and community across Wisconsin?\nWisconsinEye operates on charitable donations. If you value this network please make a tax-deductible gift in support of our 2025 operations. It\u2019s easy. Just go to\u2026\nWISEYE.ORG/DONATE\nOr by mailing a check to WisconsinEye122 W. Washington Ave. Suite 200Madison, WI 53703\nIf you feel the tug to become a champion for WisconsinEye, please call me. The phone is on 24/7. My number is 608-316-5490.\nToday is a good day. With your help, tomorrow will be even better.\nThank you.\nFacebook\nX\nLinkedIn\nUpcoming Events\nJun\n20\nFeatured\n11:30 am\n-\n1:00 pm\nRefining Wisconsin\u2019s voting administration ahead of the \u201926 elections\nJun\n24\nFeatured\n11:30 am\n-\n1:00 pm\nWisPolitics Luncheon with Attorney General Josh Kaul\nSep\n24\nFeatured\n11:45 am\n-\n1:15 pm\nNewsmaker Luncheon with MPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius\nOct\n2\nFeatured\n11:45 am\n-\n1:15 pm\nNewsmaker Luncheon with Milwaukee\u00a0Archbishop\u00a0Jeffrey Scott Grob\nView Calendar\nOrder copies of the WisPolitics 2025 Directory today", "ped_digest": "P:Seeking donations to meet $500,000 fundraising goal|WisconsinEye aims for a robust network with enhanced viewer experience and classroom initiatives|Network relies on charitable donations for operations|WisconsinEye is a model for bipartisanship and equal treatment|Tax-deductible gifts maximize impact|Need to raise funds to cover budgetary needs for the remainder of 2025;E:WisconsinEye president Jon Henkes issues a message|Network seeks donations to maintain operations|WisconsinEye celebrates 17 years of public service|Network envisions a bigger, better tomorrow with expanded coverage and programming|WisconsinEye faces a fundraising challenge;D:Fundraising goal of $500,000 by mid-August|115,000 unique website visitors in the last 12 months|Donation request of $4.38 per visitor|WisconsinEye operates on charitable donations|Tax-deductible gifts|WisconsinEye website: WISEYE.ORG/DONATE|Mailing address: WisconsinEye122 W.
