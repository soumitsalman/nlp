Despite some criticism over the franchise's longevity, _God of War_ remains a staple in the PlayStation's lineup, with a TV adaptation and potential for exploring new mythologies on the horizon. The series' success is attributed to its spectacle and the compelling character of Kratos, whose journey from a slasher villain to a father seeking redemption resonates with audiences. The franchise's future, including the possibility of Kratos facing different mythologies, is eagerly anticipated by fans, with hopes that Sony Santa Monica will continue to innovate while honoring the series' roots.", "text": "From the original game to 2022's _Ragnarok_ , _God of War_ has shown time and again it can take players on some big, mythical journeys. \nBy  Justin Carter  Published March 22, 2025  | Comments (6)  |\n\ud835\udd4f\nCopied!\nThe PlayStation 2 is one of the most important game consoles, because it\u2019s where the current triple-A landscape was born. Third-party giants like _Resident Evil _and  _Monster Hunter_ took shape here, and the console\u2019s first-party lineup made its creators into A-tier names.\nLook no further than the original _God of War,_ which just turned 20 years old. Sony Santa Monica\u2019s hack-and-slash title was pretty impressive back in the day, helped by an alluring demo that dropped players into the action right away and showed them what it was all about: slinging blades, killing everything in sight, and finishing off mythological creatures in increasingly gruesome ways. By that point in the PS2\u2019s lifetime, the console\u2019s big action game was _Devil May Cry, _and while there was some overlap in terms of style and ridiculousness, Kratos\u2019 adventure appealed to a different (but maybe equally juvenile) audience.\nSo players fell in love with  _God of War,_ and thus a franchise was born. Sony Santa Monica has led the charge on mainline installments like _God of War III_ \u2014which turned 15 earlier in March\u2014or the more recent Norse duology, while the late Ready at Dawn made spinoffs like _Chains of Olympus_ and _Ghost of Sparta,_ which built out Kratos\u2019 life before and between the first two games. Despite a generally consistent quality, it eventually felt like the two studios were trying to milk the franchise for all it was worth. (And if that didn\u2019t tip you off, the failed go at a movie adaptation would\u2019ve done it.) By the time 2013\u2019s _Ascension_ rolled around, Kratos didn\u2019t seem to have any more gas in the tank, despite _III\u2019s_ ending indicating he could (and would) come back to kill again.\nAnd come back he did with 2018\u2019s  _God of War,_ a soft reboot that saw Kratos with a son, a wicked axe, and a new pantheon to brutalize, as well as plenty of opportunities to reflect on his past sins and the murderous adventures that made up his Greek era. Given everything Kratos did and killed during those earlier games\u2014 _God of War III_ is basically a disaster epic brought on by a slasher villain\u2014it couldn\u2019t help be a strange ask to buy into him not just having another kid, but wanting better for the young Atreus during their trek through Midgard to scatter his late wife\u2019s ashes. But the approach resonated with fans and newcomers, largely thanks to the lead performances of Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic.\nThroughout its 20-year life, _God of War_ has been defined by its eye for spectacle. The series has always painted Kratos as a force of nature whose presence inevitably devastates everything around him. For as much time PlayStation\u2019s first-party lineup has devoted to cinematic greatness, this particular series achieves that feat more often (and with more fun) than most. From fights against titans and dragons, to against gods that play out like the love child of shonen fights and wrestling matches, the series is packed with one moment after another that makes experiencing them a complete blast. Other action games have tried to match that scale or combat of Kratos\u2019 adventures, and generally do a good job at it\u2014 _Bayonetta, Darksiders,_ and _Dante\u2019s Inferno_ all came out just months before _God of War III\u2014_ but as with anything that\u2019s been around long enough, Sony Santa Monica\u2019s formula hits a particular sweet spot that\u2019s allowed the franchise to survive more console generations than its other PS2 peers.\nWith a TV adaptation in the works and other mythologies clearly up for grabs,  _God of War_ certainly isn\u2019t lacking for a future. The prospect of Kratos fighting every mythology in sight has been desired for a long time, so it\u2019s easy to imagine Sony Santa Monica just doing that, not entirely unlike  _Assassin\u2019s Creed_or  _Call of Duty_. (Just without the reliable frequency, since making the Norse games sounds like quite an endeavor.) Alternatively, it\u2019d be nice to see the studio put what it\u2019s learned from this franchise toward something new. Like Naughty Dog or Insomniac, it\u2019s been such a reliable contributor to PlayStation\u2019s ongoing success it could afford to shelve Kratos for a few years. That appears to be the case, according to a post, so here\u2019s hoping that\u2019s also successful in its own way\u2014and when it comes time for Kratos to return, it feels as big a deal it did when the reboot was .\n> Want more io9 news?

It turns out in practice, that means you can say your favorite slurs but can\u2019t protest government overreach. Following the arrest of the primary political rival of Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, demonstrators have taken to the streets and to social media to protest the seemingly politically motivated action. , some of those who have taken to speaking out against the government have been suspended on X.\nPer , \u201cuniversity-associated activist accounts\u201d that share protest information including times and locations for students and other activists who might want to participate have been the primary targets of the suspensions. Most of the accounts are described as \u201cgrassroots activists\u201d with relatively small followings, typically in the tens of thousands.\nIn some cases, it seems those accounts have been suspended in Turkey\u2014where their information is most relevant\u2014and not in the rest of the world. One activist, \u00d6mer Faruk Aslan, created a second account to dodge the local censorship, and that his primary account got suspended after one of his posts exceeded six million views on the platform.\nTurkey\u2019s ruling government, led by Erdo\u011fan\u2014has claimed that suspended accounts are associated with \u201cinciting hatred.\u201d (It\u2019s worth noting that the public demonstrations against the Erdo\u011fan have taken place the government issuing a .)

But the crackdown on content on platform, the company certainly has a hand in. In fact, it\u2019s been pretty willing to bend to the will of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government when asked.\nBack in 2023, as Turkey was about to have a Presidential election, Erdo\u011fan threatened to throttle X if the company didn\u2019t comply with government requests to take down posts and accounts that it wanted removed. Musk and X , with Musk , \u201cThe choice is have Twitter throttled in its entirety or limit access to some tweets. Which one do you want?\u201d (The answer to that, if you are a \u201cfree speech absolutist,\u201d is likely the former, refuse to give in to a censorship demand and let the chips fall where they may.) Additionally, X has complied with 86% of Turkey\u2019s government requests to take down content in the second half of 2024, per the company\u2019s .\nThe math isn\u2019t too hard for Erdo\u011fan.

The suit alleges the company misled consumers when it sold raw chicken cat food as healthy, failing to acknowledge potential risks, such as potential death from the consumption of H5N1-infected food.\nThe lawsuit, filed by Tim Hanson, seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees, according to in Oregon. Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and told the news outlet he typically feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because \u201cI believe in the health benefits of it.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear what health benefits Hanson believes can come from raw chicken.\nHanson told KTVB 7 he bought the Wild Coast Pet Foods brand cat food in January but one day in early February Kira stopped eating. Hanson told the news outlet he brought her to the vet on Feb. 5 and a few days later tests confirmed Kira had bird flu. Kira was so sick she had to be euthanized on Feb. 9.\nWild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. The food was sold in Washington and Oregon.\nThe warning from the recall, which was posted on the FDA\u2019s website:\n> People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with pets exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should contact their veterinarian.\nThe spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1. Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected.\nNo humans in the U.S. have contracted bird flu from eating food, at least as far as health authorities can tell. But it does appear that cats are getting it from the consumption of raw food. U.S. health agencies have tested both milk and beef and it appears both are safe for human consumption even with the presence of bird flu as long as the milk is pasteurized and the beef is cooked to at least medium.\nThere\u2019s also no evidence of human-to-human spread of the bird flu in the U.S. but there is concern a mutation could allow that to happen. There have been 70 cases of H5N1 documented in Americans with one death. Forty-one of those cases have been tied to dairy cattle, 24 have been traced to poultry farms, two cases are from backyard flocks and wild birds, and three cases are still unknown sources.\nWild Coast didn\u2019t respond to questions emailed Friday.

Apparently, that impact wasn\u2019t very good, in some cases:\n> Of the roughly 1,700 participants in the study, about 60 percent experienced at least one side effect, according to internal emails, spreadsheets and other documents. Blood tests revealed that participants saw their testosterone levels drop and became prediabetic after following Mr. Johnson\u2019s diet plan. It\u2019s unclear how severe the side effects were.\n> \u201cLongevity mix: A lot of comments about hating this as it is making them sick, vomit, have heartburn, etc.,\u201d one Blueprint employee wrote to a colleague in February 2024.\n> Allulose, an ingredient in the longevity mix and a sugar alternative that Mr. Johnson has pitched to his social media followers, also caused issues. \u201cTONS of people saying it\u2019s causing nausea, bloating,\u201d wrote an employee.\n\u201cThe New York Times tried to come for me and missed,\u201d Johnson on Friday. \u201cWhat was meant to be a takedown ended up reading like a profile piece,\u201d he went on, claiming that the paper \u201ccame up empty\u201d and that it was only by \u201ccontorting and twisting facts to fit a narrative that they barely had enough to publish.\u201d\nGizmodo reached out to Blueprint for comment, though the company says its typical response time is 1-2 business days. We also reached out to the NLRB.

Tourist reservations at key hot spots around the United States have reportedly fallen off amid turmoil in the National Park Service, which was recently hit by DOGE-fueled layoffs of more than 1,000 staff. The cuts have been temporarily rolled back following legal challenges, but uncertainty remains.\n_Business Insider_ with park advocates and business owners around the country, and the conclusion is that the public is taking a wait-and-see approach to the upcoming summer season. One hotelier near Yosemite told the website that his three resorts are down 1,000 bookings over last year. On the east coast, near the Cape Cod National Seashore, hotel reservations are reportedly down approximately 5% for the peak season. The typical booking season runs from January through March.\nIt is possible some of this has to do with broader economic uncertainty, but _Business Insider_ identified other more direct reasons.\nOne of the biggest concerns cited that could be keeping people away is the NPS\u2019s decision to suspend its reservation system, which required visitors to book a set time and day they could visit the park. \u201cKnowing whether there would be a reservation system or not has made it difficult for people to plan trips \u2014 why book a hotel room when you can\u2019t be certain you\u2019ll even be able to get into the park on the days you\u2019re there?\u201d NPS has not said whether it will bring back the reservation system for the fast-approaching summer season.\nThere has also been a notable drop in interest from Canadians, according to . Niedzwiecki, from the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, told _Business Insider_ he has heard from recurring Canadian visitors who are \u201cvery direct\u201d about not wanting to visit this year over the soured state of relations with the U.S.\nIf tourists do manage to get into the parks, potential understaffing could result in a noticeable impact on park visitors\u2019 experience: Visitor centers staffed by volunteers or non-profits; smaller parks being closed on weekdays; long waits at entrance stations; trails not being maintained, and so on and so forth. It depends on whether President Trump can move forward with cuts.\nIt is unclear what the logic is behind cutting back on staffing in national parks, which amount to roughly 85 million acres of wild terrain across the country that requires substantial physical labor to maintain. Those staffers also collect entry fees to help fund nature preservation. In the same way that DOGE wants to and push seniors to the website, maybe Tesla will get a contract to staff up the parks with Optimus robots.\nAt least in some places like Yosemite, experts do not think there is much to worry about, at least for this upcoming season. The park typically has roughly 800 full-time and seasonal staff during the summer, which was initially cut down by 35 in complying with DOGE\u2019s directive to cut costs across the entire federal government through firings and deferred resignations. There was also a hiring freeze which would have impacted the seasonal workers the parks rely on, but the NPS says those hirings will go forward.\nThe NPS is working to reinstate the 1,000 probationary employees who were let go while the White House appeals a federal judge order, but the losses from deferred resignations are unlikely to return.\nThe drop in summer bookings seems to be having the biggest impact on local communities that rely on the parks to support small businesses. Right now, gear rental outfitters and other businesses are struggling to ascertain how many workers to hire, which could depend a lot on the next moves by the Trump administration.\nUltimately none of this may even matter to President Trump, who earlier this week announced a plan to use federal lands for new housing. He has also stated in the ongoing trade dispute with Canada that the U.S. does not need lumber from up north. Who knows, maybe the administration will be strip mining for coal and drilling for oil by Memorial Day. Or perhaps the plan is to knock down a lot of forest land in Yosemite and build a new Trump resort property.\nFor now, things are alright. Just keep in mind that if you do decide to take the chance and plan a trip to a national park, there is a 50-50 chance the toilets will be overflowing and trash will be littered everywhere.\nDOGEElon Muskpresident trump\n## Daily Newsletter\n## You May Also Like\nLatest news\n_Careless People_ Made Me Like Sheryl Sandberg \nThe Wild Speculation Over Who Will Be In _Avengers: Doomsday_ Continues \nThe Case for Donating a Kidney While You\u2019re Still Alive \n_Kaiju No. 8_ is Coming Back With a Movie and New Season \nThe Death of _Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser_ is Becoming a Documentary \nApple Wants to Turn its Watches Into Wearable AI \nIRS Might Soon Share Addresses of Undocumented Taxpayers with ICE \nThere\u2019s Always a Bigger Bane \n  * Download Hub\n  * Best VPN\n    * Best Free VPN\n    * Best Cheap VPN\n    * NordVPN Review\n    * ExpressVPN Review\n    * PIA Review\n    * ProtonVPN Review\n    * Surfshark Review\n    * Super Bowl 2025\n    * US Open 2024\n  * Best Cloud Storage\n  * Best Web Hosting\n  * About Gizmodo\n\n\nMode\nFollow us \n  * \n\n  * Home\n  * Latest\n  * Tech\n  * Reviews\n  * Science\n  * io9\n  * AI\n  * Video\n  * Deals\n\n\n  * How to Tip Gizmodo\n  * About Gizmodo\n\n\n  *     * Download Hub\n    * Best VPN\n      * Best Free VPN\n      * Best Cheap VPN\n      * NordVPN Review\n      * ExpressVPN Review\n      * PIA Review\n      * ProtonVPN Review\n      * Surfshark Review\n      * Super Bowl 2025\n      * US Open 2024\n    * Best Cloud Storage\n    * Best Web Hosting\n    * About Gizmodo\n\n\nMode\nFollow us \n  *", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://gizmodo.com/we-just-want-to-get-back-to-work-noaa-hurricane-hunter-speaks-out-after-trumps-layoffs-2000578176", "summary": "The recent mass layoffs at NOAA have left meteorologist Andrew Hazelton and many other federal employees in a bureaucratic limbo, with Hazelton being temporarily reinstated but still unable to work.

One of the affected employees was Andrew Hazelton, a meteorologist who grew up in Florida and until last month spent his days with the Hurricane Research Division Modeling Team, which helps NOAA understand these extreme storms and mitigate the worst of their impacts. Hazelton is now on administrative leave\u2014he\u2019s not allowed to work\u2014a temporary reinstatement position that could keep him (and many other NOAA staffers) in limbo as their situation works through the federal court system.\nGizmodo spoke with Hazelton by phone this week to discuss the position that he and hundreds of other federal employees at NOAA are dealing with as the DOGE cuts roll through the federal workforce. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.\n**Isaac Schultz, Gizmodo:** I understand things have changed in the last day with a memo temporarily reinstating staff in \u201cpaid, non-duty\u201d status, which potentially adds a new dimension to our conversation. Walk me through the timeline here, from your work at NOAA to the layoffs and basically how far along this rollercoaster we are now.\n**Andrew Hazelton:** I\u2019ve been with NOAA in varying capacities for over 8 years. After I got my PhD in 2016, I worked with a postdoc at Princeton University for the NOAA lab up there, NOAA GFDL in Princeton for 2 years, and then I went to AOML, the Hurricane Research Division, in 2018, working for the University of Miami. Last October I started the federal position, working for NOAA\u2019s Environmental Modeling Center doing hurricane models and model development.\nAs of yesterday we are\u2014on paper at least\u2014reinstated with admin leave, because of the court decision over the weekend. What that looks like exactly, though, there\u2019s still a lot of questions that we\u2019ll have to get answers about. It seems as though\u2014 based on the wording of what they sent us\u2014that they\u2019re waiting for another court to say that they can go through with backpay. And right now we\u2019re not allowed to work.\nI was a new federal employee even though I\u2019ve worked with NOAA for 8 years or more, and then February 27th we all got that mass email basically just informing us that we were being fired. It was sort of chaotic because they had about an hour\u2019s notice. We\u2019ve been in this limbo state. I know some people filed appeals with the merit board. There was this preliminary injunction that allows us to be reinstated, but it seems like it\u2019s going to depend on appeals of that. And there\u2019s still some uncertainty as to whether there could be a legal layoff process after that.\n**Gizmodo:** It seems like across a number of agencies, folks are not only being hit with these layoffs, but then being stuck in these situations where it\u2019s very unclear exactly what their status is, and what the federal government\u2019s next move is going to be.\n**Hazelton:** Right. It\u2019s depending on court outcomes, and even across departments it seems like certain ones are responding to the rulings differently\u2014some more enthusiastically than others. There are a lot of unknowns.\n**Gizmodo:** We could speak about some more unknowns, frankly. Your focus is hurricanes. How many folks who work specifically on the hurricanes have been impacted, at least for the time being, and what this might mean for the public\u2014people who need information about incoming storms?\n**Hazelton:** In my group, I was the main person doing hurricanes. There were other people doing other kinds of modeling: severe weather and ocean models, all sorts of things. There were other people in NOAA that were part of the hurricane hunters, the ones that fly into the hurricanes, and I did that as part of my last role. There were a few people from that group that were laid off. A couple dozen may have gotten reinstated as part of the judge\u2019s decision, but there wasn\u2019t much communication about what criteria were used for that, but some were not fully reinstated. They\u2019ve not given a lot of information about criteria or plans, but the big thing is that, if people aren\u2019t fully reinstated, it\u2019s going to be hard.\nThese are people working on some of the computer models that are our main tools collecting data. I know people in the satellite division have been affected, and satellites are one of our big tools for monitoring all sorts of weather, not just hurricanes. Effects could be felt across the board, for anybody who relies on weather data.\n**Gizmodo:** Just because our readers are very familiar with hurricanes\u2014many are in the American Southeast\u2014can you name a couple of the storms that you flew through?\n**Hazelton:** Because I was there through last year, it was the first part of the hurricane season. I was in Helene last year, and then I\u2019ve also flown in storms like Michael in 2018, Dorian in 2019, Ian, which most of the Gulf people remember, Idalia. I\u2019ve flown in quite a few big ones and done work with the aircraft data and also the modeling.\n**Gizmodo:** What is it like to fly through a hurricane, and what storm was the most unnerving to go through?\n**Hazelton:** Most of the flight is just kind of like a bumpy commercial flight. It\u2019s a P-3 aircraft. It\u2019s a propeller plane\u2014kind of a bumpy, noisy plane in general\u2014but very sturdy. But when you get in the eyewall\u2014that ring near the center that\u2019s the most intense part of the hurricane\u2014that\u2019s where you can see some real bumps.\nI think Michael was probably the storm that was the bumpiest. I wasn\u2019t on the famous Ian flight where they got really rocked around\u2014I was the one before that. So Michael and also Helene last year was a pretty intense eyewall. We didn\u2019t want to fly through because it was just so gnarly looking on radar.\n**Gizmodo:** People in and affiliated with this administration talk a lot about privatizing weather forecasting. What are your opinions on that, and what might that outlook mean for federal workers and for the way the public gets their weather information, depending on how successful you imagine that that effort being, should they proceed with it?\n**Hazelton:** The thing is there\u2019s already a pretty robust private weather enterprise. There are private companies that do good work. We work with them and a lot of them rely on NOAA data for their apps or different tools. It\u2019s really a pretty good public-private partnership that I think is honestly a model for that kind of thing. I don\u2019t think we want to get to a point where there\u2019s like a subscription-based model for warnings or any sort of life-saving data or information. Honestly, open access to data for the cost of your tax dollars is one of the things that\u2019s really been a model of NOAA. If you look at the numbers, it only costs 6 cents per American per day to fund all of NOAA at its current level.\nIt\u2019s a pretty minuscule cost when you look at like the dollars saved. Whenever there\u2019s a hurricane, better forecasts allow people to get out\u2014or vice versa, if they\u2019re not going to be impacted, they don\u2019t have to close up their school or business. Better forecasts save lives and money. In a lot of ways, NOAA really pays for itself.\n**Gizmodo:** You mentioned that some folks were reinstated early on. It sounds like it\u2019s kind of a black box as to how those decisions are being made. Is that a fair characterization?\n**Hazelton:** Yeah, there hasn\u2019t really been a whole lot of criteria or communication. I think there was supposed to be some veterans\u2019 preference for prior federal service, but it really hasn\u2019t been made clear at all to us how these decisions are being made.\n**Gizmodo:** In that case, a silly question that I\u2019ll ask anyway: Is there any idea of how long this ambiguity will last?\n**Hazelton:** No, not really. I think it\u2019s going to depend a lot on court cases and how those play out. That\u2019s above my pay grade. I\u2019m just ready to get back to work doing what I love doing and what helps protect the American public.\n**Gizmodo:** Given the abruptness of these layoffs and your hands being tied with work, it sounds like you just have some stuff sitting on your desk waiting to be resumed, which with something as dynamic as weather, is probably not the best thing.\n**Hazelton:** It\u2019s tough. My coworkers, the ones that are still there, they\u2019re great and they\u2019re working hard, but it\u2019s just hard when you have an agency that\u2019s already understaffed and just being stretched even thinner. It\u2019s hard to get everything done that you want and need to.\n**Gizmodo:** Is there anything you really want to get", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://www.pocket-lint.com/samsung-frame-pro-art-tvs/", "summary": "Samsung's The Frame Pro, a QLED 4K TV with mini-LEDs, is set to improve brightness and color accuracy, addressing the aesthetic shortcomings of its predecessors.

Most notably, Samsung is improving the screen technology, implementing in this version of the Frame mini-LEDs to improve brightness and color accuracy, albeit these will be located along the bottom of the screen. One of the knocks against the OG Frame and all of its copycats was that in order to make the art part of the TV look great, it ended up sacrificing some screen quality. This version, however, is significantly improving on that so that people who enjoy artsy, attractive TVs and who also like to enjoy lifelike, cinematic content can find comfort in this model.\nIn addition, Samsung is boosting the native refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, although this increase will only really be sought after by PC gamers. It will also come with a wireless connecting box, so that HDMI cables won't be hanging off the back of the TV, creating an eyesore. It's not yet clear when it will be released or how much it will cost; but it won't be cheap.\nRelated\n#####  5 reasons to buy a Samsung TV over a Vizio TV \nImpressive screens, more variety, and superior design makes a clear case (and picture) for Samsung. \nPosts\n##  Samsung The Frame QLED 4K TV \n###  The iconic and influential art TV \n#####  Samsung FRAME QLED LS03 Series \nThe Frame has been around for a while now, but it continues to offer a quality viewing experience with a beautiful aesthetic to match. A QLED screen with a matte display and anti-glare properties makes for a quality viewing experience, while personalized bezels and a customizable frame transform the TV into a piece of decor that looks great on the way. The Frame boasts an extensive art gallery so that when you're not watching TV, you can put on a slideshow of iconic works.\nSamsung has updated The Frame over the years, with the latest boasting a fast processor, motion sensors, as well as sought-after features like Dolby Atmos, Filmmaker Mode, and HDR10+. Still, the knock against it is that it lacks the cinematic fidelity, peak brightness, and color volume that high-end TVs offer. It's a worthy TV for those who casually enjoy a lot of different kinds of content, but it's not the best for those who want an awe-inspiring and realistic image on screen.\nRelated\n#####  The real difference between HDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision \nHigh Dynamic Range improves your TV's image quality, but competing formats make shopping around confusing.\nPosts\n##  Hisense CanvasTV QLED \n###  A budget-friendly alternative with a popular OS \n#####  Hisense S7N CanvasTV \n$698 $1000 Save $302 \nOne of the drawbacks of The Frame is that it comes with a relatively high price tag. You're not just paying for the TV technology, you're paying for the aesthetic and the brand. Hisense's artistic alternative comes in at a lower price point, making it instantly appealing. Like The Frame, it boasts an art gallery, an anti-glare screen, a motion detector, a replaceable frame, and a slim design to make it look good on the wall.\nIt also features Google TV, a popular OS that outdoes Tizen in some areas, including customization and app availability. It features a native refresh rate of 144Hz, and unlike Samsung, it offers both the high-end video formats in HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. Still, its contrast and brightness are relatively average; it's not a TV that's ideal for those seeking to faithfully enjoy prestige TV shows or the works of auteur filmmakers and creatives.\nRelated\n#####  Hisense's Mini-LED QLED TV shines in one big way, with its price casting a shadow \nWith rich colors and contrast and plenty of gaming features, it's built for all-around use. \nPosts\n##  TCL NXTFrame QLED TV \n###  A stylish model with some worthy features \nTCL\n#####  TCL NXTFrame \nTCL's artistic offering is a bit of a mouthful, but NXTFRAME TV is more attractive than the cumbersome name suggests. It only became available in the U.S. last year, but it's done well to rival Samsung in a few areas. It features an art gallery, a slim design, and all the other specs that make a smart TV an 'art TV.' Notably, it offers AI-generated art works, which may be a dealbreaker depending what you think about \"AI art.\"\nLike Hisense's TV, TCL bests Samsung by offering both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, and runs on Google TV OS. Still, with an emphasis on esthetics, it suffers when it comes to image and video quality. The screen struggles with contrast and is best enjoyed in a dark room without any ambient light due to its relatively low peak brightness. It has some attractive gaming features, but isn't the best for those seeking cinematic fidelity, a common trait across the board.\nRelated\n#####  7 reasons I'd buy an LG TV over a TCL TV \nBeyond impressive OLED displays, LG offers TVs to suit your lifestyle.\nPosts\n##  Ambient Mode and art gallery TVs \n###  Smart TVs with artworks and slim designs \n#####  Samsung S90D \n$1198 $1798 Save $600 \nWhile there are only a handful of smart TVs that feature a notable frame and matte display, two features designed to accentuate the model's artistic merit, there are plenty of these that boast some of the artistic traits of these TVs on a smaller scale. Some new Samsung TVs offer Ambient Mode, with prints and calming videos and images to display, while Roku has a feature called Backdrops, allowing you to display photos and artworks when the TV is not in normal use. Some LG TVs also feature an Art Gallery Mode.\nIn addition, both Samsung and LG are making efforts to fix the cable situation when mounting a TV, tidying up the cords or removing them altogether from behind the unit so that they don't just dangle towards the ground.\nFor those who don't want to sacrifice performance and power when watching the latest movies and TV shows, new TVs with slim builds and these latent modes allow you to still enjoy some artistic quality to the TV without losing out on all your content consumption.\n  * TVs\n\n\nFollow \nFollowed \nShare\nReaders like you help support Pocket-lint.

While many of these flights connect to destinations that may have fewer passengers (e.g., Christchurch in New Zealand and Conakry in Guinea), they can also connect popular destinations (e.g. New York JFK Airport to Milan). \nSome of these routes are comparatively short haul (e.g. to Cyprus and Malta), while most are long haul. Separately, another world leader with fifth freedom routes is Ethiopian Airlines . Here is what to know about Emirates' scheduled fifth freedom routes. \n##  What are \"fifth freedom flights\"? \nIn 1944, the (aka the Chicago Convention) established the \"Freedoms of the Air\" rules. It included basic aviation rights, like the right of an airline to operate scheduled flights through another country's airspace (called the First Freedom).\nPhoto: Bradley Caslin | Shutterstock\nThe so-called \"Fifth Freedom\" describes an airline's right to carry revenue passenger traffic or cargo between two countries that it isn't based in. However, at least one segment of the flight needs to begin or end in the airline's home country. These two flights or segments of the same flight are operated as a single flight with a single flight number, and it requires approval from all three countries' aviation authorities.\nThis can enable airlines to operate flights to destinations that their aircraft would otherwise not be able to reach. One example is Australian Qantas' Airbus A380 flights to London Heathrow that stop over in Singapore along the way.\nHowever, this Qantas example may soon come to an end. Qantas already flies directly between London-Heathrow and the western city of Perth. But the East Coast cities of Sydney and Melbourne are still out of reach. That will change when Qantas receives its new Airbus A350-1000s that will fly directly to Heathrow . \nPhoto: KITTIKUN YOKSAP | Shutterstock\nFifth freedom flights also enable aircraft to pick up and drop off more passengers along the way. Basically, they collect and deliver passengers at/to two destinations. An example is Emirates' flight from Dubai to Sydney in Australia and Christchurch in New Zealand.\nAirlines like Emirates and Air Canada also operate fifth-freedom flights to South America, stopping in Brazil's S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro before arriving in Argentina's Buenos Aires. Without the stop, the airlines might not be able to attract enough passengers to fill the aircraft to either one of the destinations. This appears to be the driving motive behind Emirates' comparatively long list of fifth-freedom flights.\nRelated\n#####  Examined: The Advantages Of 5th Freedom Flights From A Passenger Perspective \nThe fifth freedom of air travel has had plenty of controversies, but such flights also offer some of the most delightful benefits. \nPosts\n##  Why Emirates has so many fifth-freedom flights \nEmirates stands out as a mainline carrier that doubled its fifth freedom capacity between 2003 and 2013. Zooming out, the advent of smaller but long-ranged aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, along with other factors, have made fifth-freedom flights less popular.\nPhoto: Lukas Wunderlich | Shutterstock\nAccording to , Emirates is set to fly up to 907 fifth freedom flights a month in 2025. The peak month is July 2025, while April 2025 is scheduled to have 818 fifth freedom flights. In March, Emirates is scheduled to operate 887 fifth freedom flights from Dubai. Notably, of the 16 fifth-freedom routes Emirates has scheduled for March, only three of them are with its Airbus A380 , the other 13 being Boeing 777-300ER or Boeing 777-200LR aircraft. \nIt is clear from the destinations that Emirates' Boeing 777s and A380s have the range to fly to most or all, of these destinations. With range concerns not being the primary driver, it seems Emirates operates these flights to pick up and drop off more passengers. It is also worth pointing out that most of these routes are daily, although two African routes are every second day.\nPhoto: Emirates\nTwo more fifth freedom routes are scheduled to begin later in the year - these are from Dubai through Bangkok to Da Nang in Vietnam and from Dubai through Bangkok to Siem Reap in Cambodia.\nEmirates North & South American-bound fifth freedom flights in March 2025:  \n---  \n**Origin:** |  **Through point:** |  **Destination:** |  **Aircraft type:** |  **Number of flights (monthly):**  \nDubai |  Athens, Greece |  Newark Liberty, NJ |  Boeing 777-300ER |  31  \nDubai |  Barcelona, Spain |  Mexico City, Mexico |  Boeing 777-200LR |  31  \nDubai |  Rio De Janeiro, Brazil |  Buenos Aires, Argentina |  Boeing 777-300ER |  23  \nDubai |  Milan, Italy |  New York-JFK, NY |  Airbus A380 |  31  \nDubai |  Miami, Florida |  Bogota, Colombia |  Boeing 777-300ER |  31  \nOne of Emirates' popular fifth-freedom flights is the flight from New York-JFK to Dubai via Milan in Italy. Emirates operates a total of 93 flights a month (or three flights a day) between Dubai and JFK with its Airbus A380s. Of these, two daily flights are flown directly between JFK and Dubai and one is flown to Dubai via Milan.\nEmirates Asia/Pacific-bound fifth freedom flights in March 2025:  \n---  \n**Origin:** |  **Through point:** |  **Destination:** |  **Aircraft type:** |  **Number of flights (monthly)**  \nDubai |  Bangkok, Thailand |  Hong Kong |  Airbus A380 |  31  \nDubai |  Cebu, Philippines |  Angeles/Mabalacat, Philippines |  Boeing 777-200ER |  31  \nDubai |  Male, Maldives |  Colombo, Sri Lanka |  Boeing 777-300ER |  31  \nDubai |  Singapore |  Melbourne, Australia |  Boeing 777-300ER |  28  \nDubai |  Singapore |  Phnom Penh, Cambodia |  Boeing 777-300ER |  31  \nDubai |  Sydney, Australia |  Christchurch, New Zealand |  Airbus A380 |  31  \nPhoto: Joe Kunzler | Simple Flying\nExamining Emirates' fifth freedom flight routes to the Asia Pacific, it is clear some of them cater mostly to the leisure travel market. Bangkok is one of the top tourist destinations in Southeast Asia. The Maldives and Sri Lanka are both popular tropical beach destinations.\nLater in the year, Emirates will also operate a fifth freedom flight to Bangkok and Siem Reap. Siem Reap is a small city in Cambodia with a population of only around 200,000, but it is the gateway to the immensely popular archaeological Angkor Wat \"lost city\" attraction.\nThe fifth freedom flight to the Philippines is interesting as it is the only example on the list where the second segment is within the same country. Cebu is a popular tropical beach holiday destination in the Philippines, while Angeles is known as the inland 'Sin City' destination of the Philippines.\nEmirates Europe/Africa-bound fifth freedom flights in March 2025:  \n---  \n**Origin:** |  **Through Point:** |  **Destination:** |  **Aircraft type:** |  **Number of flights (monthly)**  \nDubai |  Accra, Ghana |  Abidjan, Ivory Coast |  Boeing 777-300ER |  31  \nDubai |  Conakry, Guinea |  Dakar, Senegal |  Boeing 777-300ER |  17  \nDubai |  Larnaca, Cyprus |  Malta |  Boeing 777-200LR/300ER |  31  \nDubai |  Lusaka, Zambia |  Harare, Zimbabwe |  Boeing 777-300ER |  31  \nDubai |  Seychelles |  Antananarivo, Madagascar |  Boeing 777-300ER |  18  \nThe only fifth freedom flight Emirates is operating completely within Europe is between the twin Mediterranean island nations of Cyprus and Malta.\nPhoto: Arnold Aaron | Shutterstock\nEmirates is operating four fifth freedom flights to Africa, of which two are to West African destinations, one is to Southern African nations, and one is to African island nations.\nRelated\n#####  Spotting The Airbus A380: The Peak Times To Catch A Superjumbo At JFK Airport \nThree airlines are scheduled to be flying most of their A380 flights into JFK in two waves in the morning and afternoon in March. \nPosts 1\n##  Once a common phenomenon \nMost of the world's flag carriers operate flights directly to and from their main hubs. In the past, a lack of passengers and a lack of range meant that airlines would make stops along the way between beginning and end destinations. The first passenger flights operated something like buses or trains, calling in at stops along the way and allowing passengers to embark or disembark. Today, most flights are 'express'.\nPhoto: \nNow it is easier to fill up the aircraft, while aircraft have the range needed to fly directly from point to point. For example, modern widebody jets can fly nonstop from Los Angeles to New Zealand across the Pacific.

Airports worldwide have varying runway lengths, allowing them to safely accommodate a certain number of aircraft types. The design and condition of an factor into the calculations airlines and their pilots will take to ensure the aircraft arrives or departs safely.\n##  Factors at play for an airport runway \nThe runway length allows safe takeoffs and landings for varying airline sizes. The airport is responsible for ensuring that the runway has been meticulously planned and maintained to facilitate the safe movement of aircraft. Correcting the runway length is crucial for an airport, as it will outline its ability to accept various-sized aircraft.\nPhoto: | Wikimedia Commons\nAn airport runway is a rectangular area in the landing field, which is prepared especially for the arrival and departure of aircraft. While the world's major airports have asphalt or concrete runways, the runway can be as simple as an uncovered grass or a dirt strip in smaller regional areas.\nThis is due to the varying needs of that airport and region. Runways are identified with their alignment to **magnetic north** , which translates to 08 for a runway facing 80 degrees to magnetic north.\nLarger airports with multiple runways distinguish their runways with letters, such as 08L (left) and 08R (right). Major airports frequently have various runways, sometimes up to five or six, and have varying sizes for bigger commercial jets to accommodate aircraft such as the Airbus A380 , Boeing 747, and even the Antonov Antonov AN-225 . Smaller regional aircraft, in turn, use the shorter runways to ensure airport efficiency. \nRelated\n#####  What Private Jets Can Land On Dirt Runways? \nOnly one popular aircraft can land on rugged runways made of dirt. \nPosts 3\nLove aviation history? Discover more of our stories here\n###  Airport runways and varying sizes around the world \nThe length of an airport runway will vary depending on the region's needs, with smaller airports or aerodromes having runways at around 1,000 feet (350 meters) up to the world's largest runways. The world's longest runways are at Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport and Shigatse Peace Airport (5,000 m / 16,404 ft). Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport in Russia and Shigatse Peace Airport in China are home to the world's longest runways at 5,000 meters.\nPhoto: \u9489\u9489 | \nUlyanovsk Vostochny, in Russia, is known for serving as a cargo and test flight center in Russia's aviation industry. Smaller airports will commonly have a narrow runway, sometimes as narrow as 75 feet (23 meters), compared to larger airports, where this can expand up to 200 feet (61 meters).\nWhile the airport's dependency on aircraft can play one factor in runway design, other factors must be considered when designing an airport runway, such as:\n  * **Airport elevation**\n  * **General weather conditions**\n  * **Geographical considerations**\n  * **Environmental considerations**\n\n\nRelated\n#####  Why Airport Runways Sometimes Get Renumbered \nThe earth's magnetic pole can move several miles each year.\nPosts 1\n##  The pros and cons of larger runways \nLarger runways are crucial to accommodate larger airplanes and those traveling at higher speeds. Compared to smaller planes, a large aircraft requires more room to ensure enough speed and velocity for takeoff and more room to apply the brakes when landing.\nLonger runways are essential for airports located in hotter climates. When positioned at a higher altitude, the aircraft engines at these locations perform less efficiently due to dry climates and humid conditions. An adequate runway length is also essential as it allows the aircraft to have a sufficient area to stop safely should there be an aborted take-off or, perhaps, a rejected landing.\nMajor commercial airports usually have runway lengths between 8,000 and 13,000 feet. If you're important enough to fly in a private aircraft, they commonly need just between 5,000 and 6,000 feet to take off and land safely, but this can vary greatly depending on the size and weight of the jet.\n###  A runway length can factor in the airplane's overall performance. \nRunways impact an aircraft performance when looking to take off and land. This is due to the required lengths for reaching the necessary speeds to achieve enough velocity to achieve a safe lift. If the runway is too short, this could result in the aircraft leading a failed takeoff, which, as a result, could lead to safety incidents if the plane cannot arrive or depart safely.\nAs a plane comes to land, sufficient runway length is needed for the airplane to stop safely after touchdown. Should a plane come into land on a too short runway, it can result in significant safety concerns, so airports must implement the appropriate runway length to cater to the aircraft operating at the airport. An example of this is Wellington Airport in New Zealand (IATA code **WLG**). The airport straddles the Cook Strait and Evans Bay. The airport's most commonly operated aircraft are as large as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 / A321. \nHowever, previously, Singapore Airlines operated its capital connection service from WLG to Canberra and eventually changed to Melbourne ; however, it operated with the Boeing and Airbus widebodies. Still, the aircraft had to operate with significant weight restrictions because the runway length was only 5,955 feet (1,815 meters). There have been numerous conversations about extending the runway to open up more international routes to the country's capital city, but these expansions are yet to eventuate. \nRelated\n#####  Singapore Airlines To Serve Wellington With Their New Airbus A350s \nPosts\nWant answers to more key questions in aviation?

Let's have a look at some of the United States' busiest airports and their longest runway length, as analyzed by :\nAirport |  IATA Code |  Runway length (feet)  \n---|---|---  \n**New York John F.

This caters to most narrowbody jet aircraft. If a larger widebody aircraft is coming into land, it would need a maximum of 8,000 feet at sea level. If airports operate at a higher altitude, a longer runway is usually required.\nPhoto: \nInternational widebody aircraft, which carry large amounts of fuel for their long-haul trips, are heavier planes and could require up to 10,000 feet of runway to land safely or 13,000 feet at minimum to take off. The Boeing 747, also known as the Queen of the Skies, is one of the largest passenger aircraft still in operation and requires one of the longest runway distances when compared between aircraft types.\nWhile there can be several financial and operational considerations that airlines will consider when deciding to operate to and from a new airport, the mechanics and capabilities of the airport are at the forefront of any decision. Considerations that are usually studied are:\n  * **Availability of airport services**\n  * **Access to aviation fuel**\n  * **Maintenance facilities**\n  * **Demand**\n  * **Financial incentives**\n  * **Runway lengths to understand if the airport is capable of accepting certain aircraft types**\n\n\nPhoto: \nGet the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: Sign up for our newsletters today.\n##  The Airbus A380 and its runway requirements \nThe largest commercial passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, is a double-decker aircraft once manufactured by European plane maker Airbus.

So, for example, if you earn 10,000 MQDs between January 1st, 2025 and December 31st, 2025, you would qualify for Gold Medallion status for the subsequent calendar year (January 1st, 2026 to December 31st, 2026).\nIf you don't reach the threshold even for Silver Medallion, you will still be part of the Delta SkyMiles program but known as a 'General' member.\nHowever, status resets each year, so to sustain your Gold Medallion status for the following year, you would then need to accumulate at least another 10,000 MQDs during the year.\n#####  SkyMiles  **Participating Airlines** \n     Delta Air Lines **Owner** \n     Delta Air Lines **Region** \n     North America **Countries** \n     United States  **Established Date** \n     1981 \n##  What does each Delta Medallion tier offer? \nEven the lowest-tier perks for Delta Medallion are rewarding, so it does pay off to qualify for Medallion status, no matter how low on the ladder you reach. For example, Silver members are open to unlimited complimentary cabin class upgrades (on the day) and also get priority check-in and boarding, among other benefits.\nRelated\n#####  5 Luxurious Benefits Of Earning Delta Medallion Status \nMedallion status can significantly improve the travel experience.\nPosts\nAs you go up the tier list, you can access the airline's 'Choice Benefit' program, which offers perks like upgrade certificates, Delta Sky Club membership, and more.\n###  Silver \nThe entry-level tier is Silver Medallion status, which requires **a minimum of 5,000 MQDs** in a calendar year. The benefits of this tier are extensive and include:\n  * 7 miles per dollar spent \n  * Unlimited complimentary upgrades \n  * Priority check-in and boarding (Zone 5) \n  * Free first checked bag (for up to eight companions too!) \n  * Complimentary preferred seats \n  * Personalized Medallion bag tags \n  * SkyTeam 'Elite' status \n\n\nThe terms of complimentary upgrades differ depending on Medallion status, getting better as you go up. These are the terms of complimentary upgrades for Silver Medallion members:\nUpgrade |  Availability  \n---|---  \n**Unlimited Complimentary US 50 Delta One** |  Day of departure  \n**Unlimited Complimentary First Class** |  24 hours before departure  \n**Unlimited Complimentary Delta Comfort+ Seat Access** |  24 hours before departure  \n**Unlimited Complimentary US 50 Delta One, First Class & Delta Comfort+ Upgrades for a Companion** |  Yes  \n**Unlimited Complimentary Class Premier Upgrades on select Aeromexico-operated flights** |  24 hours before departure  \n**Complimentary Preferred Seats** |  Yes  \nBe advised that fares purchased using E fares, Award Tickets, Miles + Cash, and Pay with Miles are not eligible for upgrades.\n###  Gold \nReaching Gold Medallion status comes at double the rate of Silver with **a** **minimum of 10,000 MQDs** in a calendar year. Among the improvements on Silver include SkyPriority services and \"Elite Plus\" status when flying with a SkyTeam partner airline.\n  * 8 miles per dollar spent \n  * Unlimited complimentary upgrades (up to 72 hours) \n  * Full SkyPriority service suite \n  * Waived same-day confirmed fees \n  * In-flight drink vouchers \n  * Priority boarding (Zone 4) \n  * SkyTeam 'Elite Plus' status \n\n\nThe same rules apply for complimentary upgrades, but they are available 72 hours before departure, which is three times earlier than in the Silver tier.\n###  Platinum \nAchieving Platinum Medallion status requires **a minimum of 15,000 MQDs** in a calendar year. This is where members first gain access to the carrier's 'Choice Benefit' concept, a customizable perk which includes things like upgrade certificates, status gifting or MQD for your next renewal.\nPhoto: RYO Alexandre | Shutterstock\nThese are the Choice Benefit options currently in place for Platinum Medallion holders:\n  * 4 Regional Upgrade Certificates \n  * $400 in American Express Credit on Delta SkyMiles American Express Cards \n  * 30,000 bonus miles \n  * 1,000 MQD towards next year's qualification \n  * Gift Silver Medallion status to two members \n  * 6,000 Starbucks Rewards Stars \n  * $1,500 Wheels Up Private Flight Credit \n  * $400 Delta Vacations Experience (flight + hotel) \n  * $250 Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) contribution \n  * $300 Delta or Delta Vacations travel voucher \n\n\nPlatinum members also have access to a customer service helpline with priority ahead of Silver and Gold members, but not as high as Diamond tier's VIP hotline.\n###  Diamond \nGetting to Diamond status requires almost double the earnings, at **a minimum of 28,000 MQDs** per calendar year. The two key differences compared to Platinum are that Diamond Medallion members get three additional Choice Benefits and complimentary Clear Plus membership.\nRelated\n#####  Top 5 Benefits That Come With Delta Diamond Medallion Status \nThere are quite a few benefits that come along with Medallion status.\nPosts 1\nDiamond members get the highest priority for complimentary upgrades beginning 120 hours before departure and a rate of 11 SkyMiles per dollar spent, There are some other key differences to the Choice Benefits that distinguish Diamond options from Platinum, including:\n  * Delta Sky Club Executive (3 Choice Benefit selections) or Individual (2 Choice Benefit selections) membership \n  * 2,000 MQDs towards next year's qualification \n  * Gift Gold Medallion status to two members \n\n\nPhoto: Alaska Airlines\nFor those who don't know, Clear Plus is an expedited security clearance program that typically costs around $200 per year to join. It gives access to faster security lines available at around 60 US airports. Membership is free for Diamond members and comes with a $40 discount for all other Medallion tiers and Delta SkyMiles American Express cardholders.\n##  How to earn Delta Medallion status \nSince the thresholds for Medallion status have gone up, some customers who previously qualified will find they no longer make the cut. However, there are ways to earn MQDs other than through direct expenditure alone, including bonuses from credit cards (which Delta calls an \"MQD Headstart\"), holiday expenditure, and credit card spending.\n###  Delta flights \nMQDs are earned at a rate of 1 per dollar spent when purchasing Delta-marketed flights, for example with mainline Delta or a Delta Connection flight. This includes just the fare and airline fees, but not the added taxes and other fees - additionally, Basic Economy fares do not contribute to your MQD total at all.\nPhoto: Joe Kunzler | Simple Flying\n###  MQD Headstart \nMedallion members holding select Delta American Express credit", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://simpleflying.com/united-airlines-apologizes-crew-remove-passengers-ventilator/", "summary": "United Airlines faced backlash after a passenger shared her experience of being asked to remove her son's ventilator before a flight.

Recently, a traveler took to social media, detailing her account of how the crew of United Airlines tried to remove her son\u2019s ventilator before a flight.\n##  Delay over ventilator \nAccording to a report by , Melissa Sotomayor was traveling with her two-year-old son from Tampa International Airport (TPA) in Florida to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) on a United Airlines flight on March 8. \nSotomayor\u2019s son was born premature, at 22 weeks gestation, and she describes his condition as \"medically complex,\" requiring him to be on a ventilator and a tracheostomy tube. However, she claims that on a recent United flight, she was asked to remove the devices from her son in preparation for takeoff.\nPhoto: Angel DiBilio | Shutterstock\nShe told the flight attendants that those machines were critical for her son because \"they are keeping him alive.\" She even showed the flight attendants medical clearance letters from two of her son\u2019s doctors. In a viral TikTok video, Sotomayor said,\n> \u201cThis message is for United Airlines. The way that you treated my son when we were attempting to fly home from Tampa to Newark was absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n##  No issues on the previous flight \nSotomayor notes that she flew with her son without any problem on an earlier United flight from Newark to Tampa. She added that she prepared in advance due to her son\u2019s medical condition and shared documentation with the airline. United cleared her son\u2019s medical device and the flight from Newark to Tampa went smoothly.\nIt was only on the return flight that flight attendants asked Sotomayor to remove her son\u2019s equipment, so the plane could take off. When she refused, another flight attendant approached her and told her that their seats could be moved because of this, according to NBC News.\nPhoto: Wirestock Creators | Shutterstock\nSotomayor explains in the video that a third flight attendant also approached her and asked her to remove her son\u2019s medical devices and that he\u2019d _\"be OK until we're in the air at a high enough altitude.\"_\nThe situation escalated further and even the captain of the flight got involved. Sotomayor recalls,\n> \u201cHe then says that I am being difficult and my son's medical equipment is a danger to other passengers and to my son, and that I am not following FAA guidelines.\n> \u201cI was really upset by the way we were humiliated in front of others in the way we were talked to. The captain talked to me as if I was purposely endangering my son, and they were unwilling to listen to the fact that my son was dependent on this equipment to keep him alive.\u201d\nThe flight departed after a delay of about an hour and Sotomayor said that she felt humiliated by the whole experience. According to NBC, United Airlines contacted Sotomayor _\"to address her concerns and apologized for any frustration she may have experienced.\"_ Simple Flying has also contacted the airline to get more details.\n##  Previous apologies by airlines \nThere have been several past incidents in which an unpleasant interaction between the cabin crew and passengers has led to the airline apologizing to the traveler involved in the incident.\nIn 2023, American Airlines apologized to a passenger named David Ryan, who was traveling with his two biracial children, when a flight attendant apparently felt suspicious of human trafficking . \nPhoto: Austin Deppe | Shutterstock\nThe incident happened on a flight from Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) when a flight attendant showed concern after the children were unresponsive when asked their names.\nRyan was questioned by the police when the plane landed and was disappointed by the experience. American Airlines later issued an apology for the incident.\nIn 2024, United Airlines removed a flight attendant and apologized following a complaint that he shouted at a passenger \u2013 National Football League (NFL) Hall of Famer Terrell Davis \u2013 when he tapped him to get a cup of ice for his son.\nRelated\n#####  United Airlines Apologizes And Removes Flight Attendant After Incident Involving NFL Hall of Famer \nThe carrier has yet to issue an official apology, according to lawyers.\nPosts 20\n  * Commercial Aviation\n  * United Airlines\n  * US Airlines\n\n\nFollow \nFollowed \nShare", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://gizmodo.com/split-fiction-movie-adaptation-2000579545", "summary": "The Hollywood industry is considering adapting Hazelight Studios' _Split Fiction_ for film, a game that has gained popularity and sold over 1 million copies in a week after its release.

The pictures can contain legible text, a first for ChatGPT image generation, which is impressive. Also, the AI image generation tool can use real photos to edit them however you want.\nThe problem is that OpenAI made ChatGPT's new image generation tool available to premium users without strong safety guardrails. The web was immediately flooded with deepfakes from ChatGPT that feature celebrities and a ton of Studio Ghibli-inspired AI drawings.\nChatGPT doesn't even place a watermark on its creations to inform viewers they're AI-generated images. The metadata isn't a good enough safety feature, not when anyone can create these fakes. Gemini might remove watermarks from copyrighted creations but at least places its own watermark on the results.\nWhat's worse is Sam Altman's tone-deaf response to all of this.

Eight years after Nintendo introduced the Switch, this is the last event focused on the 2017 hardware. \nNext week, the Big N will finally unveil the first titles coming to the Nintendo Switch 2. Rumors so far reveal the company has a three-part launch plan, combining first-party titles, third-party titles, and holiday games. That said, these are the last Nintendo Switch game announcements at this March Direct.\n## Biggest Nintendo Direct announcements\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OqoRxXUjGA \n**Dragon Quest I-II HD Remake:** The first Nintendo Direct announcement is the remake of the first two Dragon Quest games.

Even though it's also coming to the Switch 2, it took a long time for the Big N to unveil this game with a proper trailer. The title gives a _Returnal_ kind of vibe but with different twists, as Samus gets psychic abilities in this weird adventure.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwAhBxakw4 \n**Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A** : After a packed Pok\u00e9mon Presents, Nintendo gave another glimpse at Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A.

The decision aligns with Apple's market trends, where base-model iPads have seen a consistent rise in sales, comprising 38% of the market share in 2024. Apple Intelligence's absence on the iPad 11 is also a reflection of its negligible impact on iPhone sales, indicating a potential lack of benefit for iPad models. The article suggests that Apple may still be considering a more powerful iPad with AI features, but it may not be imminent. The iPad 11's modest upgrade is seen as a strategic move to maintain a balance in the product lineup, avoiding cannibalization of sales from higher-end models. The article concludes by highlighting that Apple's new iPad is a minimal upgrade, with notable deals available for other products, suggesting a broader market strategy beyond the iPad's features.", "text": "# Here\u2019s why the iPad 11 doesn\u2019t have Apple Intelligence\n\nBefore Apple introduced it, rumors suggested it could be the best iPad or a boring update; unfortunately, Apple chose the second option. However, new CIRP research (via _9to5Mac_) might have revealed why Cupertino went with a mild update instead of powering up the iPad 11 with Apple Intelligence and better specs. According to the charts, sales of Apple's base-model iPads have grown significantly since the company introduced the 10th-generation model.\nIn 2023, the entry-level iPad represented 30% of all iPad sales; in the year before, it was 21%, and in 2021, 15%. In 2024, the market share rose once again to 38%.\nAlthough Apple didn\u2019t update any iPads in 2023, the launch of the iPad 10 the year before\u2014along with the more affordable iPad 9\u2014likely helped boost sales of these models.\nIn 2024, the iPad mini represented only 9% of the market share, followed by the iPad Air with 15% and the base model and iPad Pro versions with 38% each. Still, it's better for Apple to sell crazy-expensive iPad Pro models than the cheapest versions.\nImage source: CIRP\nThis is why I think Apple held back on Apple Intelligence on this iPad. After all, the new 11th-generation iPad continues to be a solid model thanks to a more capable processor, great cameras, and good battery life. However, if customers want to take advantage of Apple Intelligence features for taking notes, studying, and more, they need to pay extra and get a more powerful iPad.\nIt's important to note that Apple Intelligence hasn't been helping to improve iPhone sales, so it's likely not helping iPad models either. Nonetheless, there are other benefits to an Apple device that's AI-ready: Better specs.\nIf Apple sold an iPad with 8GB of RAM, at least 128GB of storage, and the A17 Pro chip or newer for around $400, it would be an instant hit, which could continue to cannibalize sales of other, more expensive models.\nWith that in mind, a new generation is likely still a few years away, or at least until Apple can make these more expensive iPads more valuable with other exclusive features.\n**Don 't Miss:** Apple\u2019s new iPad is barely an upgrade: Here\u2019s what\u2019s new\nThe post Here's why the iPad 11 doesn't have Apple Intelligence appeared first on BGR.\n**Today's Top Deals**\n  1.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst, suggests that Apple is focusing on enhancing screen flatness and minimizing crease marks by using a die-casting process for the hinges. Instant Digital, a Weibo leaker, claims that the proposed metallic glass hinge is up to 2.5 times more resistant than titanium alloy and has a premium finish. However, the leaker also believes that achieving a completely crease-free design is _impossible._ An insider reported that Apple has made the decision to eliminate creases completely, regardless of cost, by using new materials that prevent creases from forming on the display. The iPhone Fold is expected to be announced next year or in early 2027 with a price point of at least $2,000. The post also highlights that Apple has encouraged cooperation between various parts suppliers to address the design flaw of foldable phones.", "text": "# Crease-free iPhone Fold hinge design might be impossible\n\nA few days ago, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple would use liquid metal in the hinges of the upcoming iPhone Fold. According to his research, \"Apple is focused on improving durability, enhancing screen flatness, and minimizing crease marks in its foldable iPhone design. To achieve these goals, key components like the hinges will be crafted from liquid metal using a die-casting process.\"\nThe analyst said Apple had previously used liquid metal for small components, such as SIM ejector pins, for years. Apparently, the iPhone Fold will mark the first significant use of the material in a critical mechanical part. Moreover, Android manufacturers might also start taking advantage of this manufacturing process.\nNow, Weibo leaker Instant Digital (via _MacRumors_) gives a better look at this technology. He says this liquid metal hinge, which he calls metallic glass (amorphous metal), has better resistance to bending, deformation, and depressions while being up to 2.5x more resistant than titanium alloy. It also has a premium finish, which Instant Digital calls close to the sense of stainless steel.\nInterestingly enough, while previous rumors suggested Apple wanted to create a crease-free design for this iPhone Fold, the leaker believes it's \"impossible.\" Still, it doesn't mean Apple won't do anything it can to make it less visible.\nA previous report said: \u201cApple has made the decision to eliminate creases completely, regardless of cost, in order to differentiate their foldable phone from existing models,\u201d an insider told _ETNews_. \u201cIt is understood that they have successfully achieved this by using new materials that prevent creases from forming on the display.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what these materials are.\nThe report provides another interesting detail about the iPhone Fold design. Fixing the crease doesn\u2019t only mean fixing the foldable screen. It also means looking at how the screen connects to the hinge below it and the ultra-thin glass on top. \nApparently, Apple has found a way to prevent creasing by looking at the problem holistically. The report also says Apple has encouraged cooperation between the various parts suppliers.\nThe iPhone Fold is expected to be announced next year or in early 2027 with a price point of at least $2,000.\n**Don 't Miss:** How Apple plans to fix the biggest design flaw of foldable phones\nThe post Crease-free iPhone Fold hinge design might be impossible appeared first on BGR.\n**Today's Top Deals**\n  1.

All content and opinions expressed within belong to the author._\nDoes your wireless carrier often make you feel like you're not getting enough bang for your buck? I know that was the case for me. With all the money I used to spend on cellular service each month, my carrier's so-called \"perks\" were lackluster at best. Then, they had the nerve to cancel the ho-hum rewards program they were offering and replace it with something even worse.\nWhen it comes to exclusive benefits and experiences that help you get even more value out of your wireless carrier, there's one carrier that is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. It's time to talk about **Magenta Status** and all of our favorite perks that are available only to T-Mobile customers.\n\ud83d\udea8\nT-MOBILE EXCLUSIVES!\nMagenta status gets you Netflix, MLS, MLB, and so much more!\nT-Mobile's Magenta Status benefits include everything from free streaming services to deep discounts on movie tickets, hotel stays, and so much more. As a matter of fact, the carrier offers so many great perks that even longtime T-Mobile customers likely can't remember them all!\nWith that in mind, we wanted to dive a bit deeper into **Magenta Status** to tell you about our favorite experiences and benefits that are available to T-Mobile customers at no additional cost.\n**Netflix** : If you have one Go5G Next, Go5G Plus, or Magenta Max line, or two or more Go5G or Magenta lines, you're eligible to score yourself a Netflix subscription from T-Mobile. You'll pay nothing for the Netflix Standard with ads plan, which saves you over $100 each year including taxes. Netflix is the biggest streamer out there, and it's home to so many of the best movies and shows you can watch. On top of everything else you can stream, don't forget that _Stranger Things 5_ is coming soon. With Magenta Status, you can stream it for free!\n**$5 movie tickets** : Going to see a movie in a theater used to be a great way to have fun with the family without spending an arm and a leg. These days, tickets cost more than $20 each \u2014 and don't even get me started on concessions. That's why I love this Magenta Status perk, which gets you $5 movie tickets through Atom Tickets.\n**Hulu** : Netflix is the biggest streamer, but Hulu might be the best right now when you consider all the great exclusives they have from FX and network TV channels. _Shogun_ and _The Bear_ alone are worth the $9.99 per month that it costs for the Hulu (With Ads) plan, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Of course, why pay $9.99 per month when **Magenta Status** gets you Hulu (With Ads) for free on a qualifying Go5G Next line?\n**15% off Hilton hotel brands** : Going on vacation is a blast, but planning a vacation can be stressful when all of the costs start to add up. That's why it's so awesome that T-Mobile customers can save 15% on hotel stays at participating Hilton hotels. Hilton owns a whopping 22 different hotel brands, so you'll be able to save practically anywhere in the world.\n**Apple TV+** : T-Mobile subscribers with a Go5G Next or Go5G Plus line can score a free subscription to Apple TV+, which is normally $9.99 per month. There are so many fantastic series and movies to stream from TV+, including _Severance_ season 2, which just wrapped up. The season finale was so crazy, and you can stream it for free with Magenta Status!\n**Rental car perks** : If you're like me, you're pretty much always running late when you need to catch a flight. That's why I love this particular **Magenta Status** benefit. Enrolled T-Mobile customers can return rental cars to Dollar Car Rental without needing to refuel them. Or, if you rent an EV from Hertz instead, you can return it without having to recharge it.\n**MLS Season Pass and MLB.TV** : If you're a big sports fan, T-Mobile is the only wireless carrier you should consider. Thanks to Magenta status, you'll get the entire 2025 season of MLS Season Pass for free. Plus, you can get MLB.TV for the entire 2025 baseball season without paying a dime. That's a combined $249 value!\n**25% off event tickets** : Anyone who loves going to see concerts and shows is going to enjoy this Magenta Status benefit. T-Mobile customers can save 25% on more than 8,000 shows and concerts at over 120 different venues around the globe. On top of that, you'll gain access to special customer entrances so you can skip the line.\nThose are our favorite Magenta Status benefits that are available to T-Mobile customers. Believe it or not, however, there are even more experiences and perks you can take advantage of with Magenta Status. Other benefits include six months of free SiriusXM, four months of free Pandora Premium streaming, a free month of Google One, and plenty more.\n**Head over to T-Mobile's website** to learn all about the awesome perks you get with Magenta Status.\n\ud83d\udea8\nT-MOBILE EXCLUSIVES!\nMagenta status gets you Netflix, MLS, MLB, and so much more!\nThe post Here are our favorite Magenta Status perks you can only get from T-Mobile appeared first on BGR.\n**Today's Top Deals**\n  1.

This optimism is driven by five key factors: the resolution of the ongoing tariff drama, a shift in the White House's focus towards tax cuts, a pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve back into rate-cutting mode, a reinvigoration of the economy, and strong quarterly earnings. The resolution of the tariff issue, in particular, is seen as a pivotal moment that could lead to a series of positive economic shifts, including tax cuts, lower interest rates, and improved economic indicators. These developments are expected to collectively boost stocks into the summer. However, this bullish outlook is contingent upon the assumption that the new wave of tariffs will not persist for long. If this assumption proves incorrect, the stock market could face significant challenges. In such a scenario, investments in artificial intelligence, particularly in companies like Tesla's Optimus, could offer a safer haven.", "text": "# 5 Important Factors That Could Send the Stock Market Soaring\n\nFor the majority of 2024, the stock market enjoyed relatively smooth sailing. While stocks endured a few substantive pullbacks of 5%-plus, the **S &P 500** rose nearly 20% between January 1 and October's end.\nBut the U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump's subsequent victory threw a wrench into the mix. The market's once-steady rise quickly became more like a wild roller coaster ride.\nStocks began falling at the start of the new year, only to rally strongly into mid-February as the S&P gained more than 5%. But then another selloff began. And over the past month, the market has crashed almost 7% lower - its worst selloff since 2022. \nThe dust may not have settled yet; but we believe stocks are approaching their next turn on this roller coaster - **_and we think they 'll be roaring higher into the summer._** \nThere are five important reasons driving this bullish outlook\u2026\n## Ending With a Fizzle \nFirst and foremost, **we expect the ongoing tariff drama should soon pass**. \nThe first two months of Donald Trump's second term as president have been dominated by tariff announcements. For a while, it seemed the president was threatening fresh duties every single week.\nAll that drama has created significant economic uncertainty, driving slowed economic activity and depressed consumer confidence and stoking inflation fears.\nWe expect this will all come to a head next week, on Wednesday, April 2 - what Trump is calling \"Liberation Day.\" That's when he plans to launch his biggest wave of tariffs yet. According to President Trump, this is the \"big one.\" It will include reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries, potentially even sector-level tariffs (though recent reporting suggests those could be off the table for now). \n**_But we think this show will end with more of a fizzle, not a bang.  _**\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said he expects the U.S. to negotiate trade deals with its major trading partners soon after April 2, meaning the tariffs wouldn't stay in place for long. If he's right, then all this drama should end quickly. \nAfter all, this is the \"big one.\" Once Trump negotiates his intended deals on this next batch of tariffs and they are repealed, what happens after? In our view, probably nothing. That's because there is no \"other shoe to drop,\" if you will. This is the finale. Once it has concluded, this story should be over. \nSo, here's what we see as the base-case scenario. \"Liberation Day\" comes. New tariffs are enforced. The U.S. negotiates trade deals with its major trading partners. The tariffs get repealed, and we put all this nonsense behind us. \nThe ensuing relief should help boost stocks into summer. \n## Two Major Shifts to Boost the Stock Market\nOnce the policy uncertainty is behind us, **the White House will likely shift its focus to tax cuts**. \nWall Street abhors tariffs; but it certainly loves tax cuts. That's why stocks initially soared after Election Tuesday - investors were celebrating the potential major cuts to come. \nMuch to Wall Street's chagrin, the White House has been squarely focused on tariffs since Inauguration Day, not making progress on a big tax cut package. But we think that will change by late April. \nWe expect that once we see resolution to the impending \"Liberation Day,\" there will be a lot of headlines about politicians inching closer to tax cuts over the summer.\nThis policy shift from the White House should boost stocks throughout April, May, and June. \nAnd this isn't the only major shift coming down the pike\u2026 \nThe third bullish factor driving our outlook is that **the U.S. Federal Reserve should pivot back into rate-cutting mode shortly**.\nThe Fed did cut interest rates a few times in 2024, but it has been on pause over the past four months amid worries about sticky inflation. \nIt now appears those inflationary pressures are subsiding, with oil prices dropping below $70 a barrel and the Truflation rate collapsing below 2% in March. Meanwhile, the economy has started to show some signs of stress recently via a slowdown in consumer spending and a big crash in consumer confidence. \nAs such, it seems likely that the Fed will resume its rate-cutting campaign soon. \nIn fact, Wall Street thinks another rate cut will happen by July and that the central bank will cut interest rates between two and three times this year. We happen to think that the Fed will cut rates even earlier than that, in June, and believe it could cut up to four times in 2025. \nEither way, multiple rate cuts are most likely on the way. And that should help stocks greatly. \n## A Reinvigorated Economy and Stellar Earnings\nNow, **as tariff drama passes, tax cut hopes rise, and the Fed lowers interest rates, the economy will regain its strength**. \nAt the moment, all key economic trends are moving in the wrong direction. Consumer spending is slowing, and confidence is falling. As The Guardian noted, the Conference Board's latest \"survey's measure of future expectations hit a 12-year low and breached a level associated with an economic downturn.\" \nNot to mention, economic activity is weakening, while inflation expectations are spiking. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Inflation Project reveals that in March, businesses' year-ahead inflation expectations increased by 0.2 percentage points to 2.5 percent, on average.\nBut as the shifts that we've mentioned come into play, we think that we'll see every major economic trend reverse course for the better. \nConsumer confidence and spending will rebound. Economic activity will be reinvigorated, and inflation expectations will moderate. \nIf things shake out as expected, this reversal should offer a boost to stocks this spring. \nSo\u2026 tariff drama will end, tax cuts will arrive, the Fed will lower interest rates, and the economy will regain momentum. But perhaps the icing on this bullish cake? **Quarterly earnings should be strong, too**.\nThat is, since every key economic trend has been moving in the wrong direction lately, Wall Street has been lowering earnings estimates for the rest of the year. While bearish analysts may cite that as a reason to ditch stocks, we see it as a reason to buy. \nThe earnings bar has been lowered, making it easy for companies to clear it by the next reporting season. By that time, as we mentioned, key economic trends will likely have all reversed course for the better. \nAnd robust earnings should provide further upside to stocks \n**Put it all together, and you have quite the bullish cocktail for stocks to recover from their recent selloff and rally into the summer.  **\n## The Final Word on a Potential Stock Market Rally\nOf course, risks remain. \nOur bull thesis does rest on one huge assumption: that the new wave of tariffs coming next week will _not_ stick around for long. \nWe could be wrong on that. \nIt's always possible that the U.S. may not strike many deals with its trading partners, meaning those tariffs could stay in place. More could arrive thereafter, and the ongoing trade war could become embedded into the global economy. \nIf so, the stock market could be in for a world of hurt over the next few months. \nAnd from where we're standing, the AI trade is the most likely to offer a safe haven - even profits within a broader selloff - if things take a turn for the worst.\n**Bloomberg 's Artificial Intelligence Aggregate index** (**BAIAET**) is a strong proxy for the sector at large. It currently stands at major technical support levels (the 250-day moving average) that it hasn't yet broken. Additionally, at 21X forward P/E, it's trading at its lowest valuation since its inception, all while estimates for AI companies are still rising like crazy\u2026\nWhether you're looking for security or surplus, it seems that AI is the way to go. And we have a great way to play it.\nAI is no longer confined to software or chatbots. As this field progresses at breakneck speeds, we're quickly entering this boom's next iteration - the era of physical AI\u2026 and humanoid robots.\nYou're probably familiar with **Tesla** 's (**TSLA**) own Optimus. Now Big Tech is following Musk's lead to tackle bot development, meaning they'll likely bring them to market within a few years.\n**It seems the next stage of the AI Revolution has begun.  **\nAnd it is time to invest in this next big AI breakthrough - alongside some of the wealthiest people in the world, like Elon Musk himself. \nWe believe Optimus has the potential to profoundly change the world and go down in history as Musk's greatest achievement. \nAnd we've found a \"backdoor\" way to invest in this new project. \n**Learn more about how to get in on a game-changing supplier right now.**\n_On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article._\n_P.S.

The ability to authenticate with these credentials poses a significant security risk to both individuals and organizations. The researchers warn that LLMs trained on insecure code can inadvertently generate insecure outputs, as they cannot distinguish between valid and invalid credentials during training. This means that both types of credentials contribute to the provision of insecure code examples.

Additionally, there are reports on ransomware attacks on healthcare providers and the desire of CISOs to advance cloud security. The article concludes with a buyer's guide for SIEM tools.\n\nThe central argument is the security risk posed by the use of insecure credentials in training LLMs, supported by the fact that a significant number of credentials were found in a widely used dataset.

While 56% said AI would make \"some\" parts of their jobs obsolete, most security professionals (82%) believed AI would help make them more efficient. Twelve months later, the latter has proven to be true. As quickly as AI has evolved since this survey was taken, security operations will always require highly skilled humans to make the final decisions. \nWhen you consider that businesses now have an average of between  installed, it's not surprising that security professionals are looking to AI for some relief.\nAI is a game-changer for beleaguered security analysts who are overwhelmed by the volume of data generated by the security tools in their tech stack and outnumbered by the growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on their systems. \nWhen machine learning first rolled out, it was designed to observe, learn, and take on repetitive tasks. That's useful, but today's advanced machine learning (ML) and AI can do much more. Multilayer AI can analyze massive amounts of data to evaluate and detect potential threats. Graph machine learning takes this a step further by spotting correlations between two or more alert signals, assembling them into contextual cases for the security analyst. Large language models (LLMs) used by generative AI (GenAI) applications like ChatGPT also hold great potential to serve as personal assistants for security analysts, accelerating complex threat analysis by providing instant responses to analysts' questions. In all of these scenarios, the human analyst still drives all of the decision-making, with AI providing crucial assistance to make the analyst more efficient and accurate.\nRelated:Knostic Nabs $11M to Eliminate Enterprise AI Data Leaks\nThe downside of all this advancement in AI is that cybercriminals will also have access to this technology. In the ISC2 survey, 76% of security analysts said their greatest concern around AI was misinformation-based attacks using AI-generated deepfakes.\nIn 2025, artificial intelligence will become the most widely used tool in cybersecurity, both by malicious actors enhancing cyberattacks like hyper-realistic phishing campaigns and by technology companies rolling out AI features to help customers automate their defensive capabilities. \n## 3 AI-Driven Security Roles to Watch in 2025\nThis year, the cybersecurity job market will witness a considerable hiring spike in three highly in-demand roles critical to strengthening security operations in an AI-first world. \nRelated:Duke University & GCF Partner to Identify Pathways for Advancing Women's Careers in Cybersecurity\nThese are the three AI-driven cybersecurity roles that will be in high demand this year.\n1.Senior security analyst. This role is always in demand, but this year, expect to see the senior security analyst position more focused on evaluating AI security tools and their role in the security operations center. While many companies are successfully introducing AI to their security products and platforms, they still need human intuition and decision-making capabilities to make the final call. Senior security analysts will always be critical human anchors in this process for many organizations. \nThe qualifications for this position are:\n  * Three to six years of experience; bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, cybersecurity, or a related discipline\n  * Proficiency with multiple types of AI, including predictive AI, machine learning, generative AI, graph or graph-based AI\n  * Ability to analyze alerts and interpret data from surrounding context of complex security threats \n  * Ability to develop incident response strategies using AI-generated playbooks and conduct threat hunting\n  * Strong collaboration skills with the security team and with other departments\n  * Ability to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of AI-assisted security tools and provide feedback to improve the tools\n\n\nRelated:Man-in-the-Middle Vulns Threaten Car Security\n2.Junior SOC analyst. Junior analysts, particularly those in security operations, are highly valuable tech hires because they can quickly learn and adapt to new technologies like AI. Junior analysts can quickly uplevel their knowledge by working with AI-assisted tools that explain and add context to their findings.\nThe qualifications for this position include:\n  * One to three years of experience; bachelor's degree in computer science, information technology, cybersecurity, or a related field\n  * Proficiency with a wide variety of legacy and AI-based security tools that monitor security systems\n  * Ability to interpret security report findings and analyze for potential threats \n  * Ability to respond to and document security incidents \n  * Strong collaboration skills with team members to enhance security measures\n  * Commitment to learning, whether self-directed or through certification and additional training\n\n\n3. AI researcher. This new role will become one of the hottest cybersecurity hires in 2025. Because AI researchers can study malicious actors' use of AI in hacking campaigns, analyze AI effectiveness within the tech stack, and develop internal policies on AI usage, they will be in high demand everywhere. But their skills will be hard to find. \nQualifications for an AI researcher role include:\n  * Three to five years of experience; master's or Ph.D. in computer science, data science, information technology, or a related field \n  * Experience conducting innovative research on AI algorithms and modeling\n  * Proactively able to stay abreast of the latest advancements in AI to inform research directions and support cross-functional teams\n  * Has published AI research findings in reputable journals \n  * Has prior public speaking experience and is comfortable presenting at conferences\n  * Strong collaboration skills with the research and development team and with the senior security team \n\n\nFor candidates with a cybersecurity background who want to stay competitive, now is the time to invest in your AI skills. In the technology job market, specifically cybersecurity, it's less of a matter of your job becoming obsolete due to AI and more about losing a job opportunity due to a lack of understanding of how to operate AI within the context of a security program. Security practitioners need to find opportunities to close those AI skill gaps today. With the number of open source tools, active AI communities, and freely available training content, it's easier to do so than ever before. In other words, it's never too late to learn AI. \n## About the Author\nAimei Wei\nFounder & CTO, Stellar Cyber\nAimei Wei has more than 20 years of experience building successful products and leading teams in data networking and telecommunications.

AI's potential to transform CRM is evident in its ability to automate routine tasks, gather data, and understand customer intent.

Industry clouds are also embracing AI and large language models (LLMs), with popular CRM vendors offering multiple industry clouds.", "text": "# 9 CRM trends for 2025: AI reshapes the customer equation\n\nAI has the potential to transform every aspect of an enterprise, but nowhere more so than in customer relationship management (CRM), the outward-facing business functions of sales, marketing, and customer service.\nAI can help salespeople by automating routine tasks, gathering relevant data from multiple sources, understanding customer intent, and making suggestions and recommendations to help drive new business. Generative AI can help write marketing materials. Even more exciting is the promise of autonomous agents (agentic AI) flawlessly and seamlessly taking over a variety of customer service functions across multiple channels (voice, chatbots).\nWhile increased use of AI is by far the most significant trend in CRM, it is certainly not the only one. Here are the key developments and market factors moving CRM forward this year.\n## AI moves from hype to value\nWhile everyone recognizes the incredible potential of AI, the initial hype and excitement generated by the release of ChatGPT in 2022 has dissipated somewhat.\n\u201cFirst, people were talking about how AI could conquer the world,\u201d says Donna Fluss, founder and president of DMG Consulting. \u201cBut now we\u2019re getting past the magic and into the practical application and benefits of AI.\u201d\nHarry Datwani, a principal at Deloitte Digital, adds that many clients he talks with have tried AI pilot projects and proofs of concept (POCs), but \u201chaven\u2019t figured out how to extract value at scale and how to drive savings, whether that\u2019s productivity or efficiency or savings that translate into redirected headcount or reduced headcount.\u201d\nIn 2025, look for enterprises to seek out targeted AI use cases that deliver measurable value to the organization in areas of customer satisfaction, automated business processes, and enhanced sales revenue.\n## Agentic AI emerges as game changer\nAs exciting as AI is for things such as predictive analysis and creating content, agentic AI takes CRM to another level. Mark Purdy, managing director of Purdy & Associates, says that rather than relying on preset rules, agentic AI can act independently \u2014 and customer support automation and business intelligence are two of the technology\u2019s early promising use cases.\nThese systems \u201cdo not rely on human prompts but rather are set to optimize particular goals or objectives, such as maximizing sales, customer satisfaction scores, or efficiency in supply chain processes. They can carry out complex sequences of activities, independently searching databases and triggering workflows to complete activities,\u201d Purdy says.\nDatwani predicts that cutting-edge organizations will begin to deploy agentic AI \u201cwithin the enterprise walls\u201d in 2025, but probably not for direct interaction with customers \u2014 at least not yet. \u201cParticularly in regulated industries, companies are excited by agents that engage with end customers, but there\u2019s still some trepidation and nervousness,\u201d because AI system do make mistakes that could cause damage to brand reputation.\nForrester analyst Kate Leggett agrees that agentic AI could eventually completely automate customer engagement, but we\u2019re not there yet. AI agents on the market today are limited in what they can accomplish, she says, but \u201cthey will get better very quickly.\u201d\n## AI drives workforce realignment\nAdoption of AI requires realignment and rethinking of the CRM workforce. AI can be positioned to boost employee retention by easing the burden of routine tasks for harried workers, particularly in high-stress, high-burnout jobs such as customer service.\nBut this also means adjusting job descriptions, changing goals and objectives, and retraining employees to work cooperatively with AI, while also overseeing and monitoring the AI.\nAt another level, the AI systems themselves can help orchestrate the most efficient use of human expertise. For example, Fluss envisions an AI orchestration layer within a contact center that routes customer inquiries to the appropriate person with the required skill set to meet that customer\u2019s needs.\nThe AI system can then apply that routing intelligence to making workforce management decisions \u2014 how many of this or that type of human expert (tech support vs. billing problem) is needed.\n## Outcome-based pricing is on the rise\nThere is rising debate over how agentic AI will be priced. One model, outcome-based pricing, was first introduced to the CRM market in August 2024 by Zendesk for its increasingly autonomous AI agents. Zendesk said at the time, \u201cOur pricing is now directly tied to the outcomes delivered by AI agents, meaning customers will only incur costs for issues that are resolved autonomously by AI.\u201d\nKeith Kirkpatrick, research director at the Futurum Group, says, \u201cOutcomes-based pricing offers benefits for both vendors and customers by guaranteeing value and aligning costs with results. Zendesk, for example, plans to charge for successfully resolved interactions, while Workhuman has introduced guarantees tied to broader metrics such as employee retention.\u201d\nHe adds, \u201cThough still in its early stages, outcomes-based pricing is gaining attention as AI agents become more widespread. It addresses customer demands for ROI-driven investments and flexibility, especially compared to traditional fixed licensing fees. As AI agents improve and become integral to business processes, this pricing model could increase vendor stickiness and reshape SaaS market dynamics.\u201d\n## Composable CRM gains traction\nForrester\u2019s Leggett explains that a major problem with CRM is that vendors have stuffed so many features in their CRM packages that customers are overwhelmed. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a bunch of customers who are using the leading CRM solutions, and they tell me that they can\u2019t keep up with the pace of innovation. Vendors are rolling out so much innovation so fast they don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d\nShe adds, \u201cAI and automation are coming fast and furious. Now, we\u2019ve got a wave of AI agents who are going to do more and more work, but CRM vendors need to think about simplification and breaking down their products into composable bits of functionality that customers can pick up, license, and use.\u201d\nLeggett believes the composable CRM movement is picking up steam, with Creatio leading the way, and other CRM vendors following suit.\n## CRM when the customers are machines\nOne emerging AI use case involves personal assistants that can autonomously plan your vacation, order your groceries, or take other actions based on what they know about your preferences. Similarly, in the business world, AI agents will soon be able to take over large purchasing decisions, even negotiating contract terms, says Gartner analyst Don Scheibenreif.\nFor example, Scheibenreif foresees a day when a factory robot goes out and orders its own replacement parts.\n\u201cOrganizations need to be ready for machines knocking at your door,\u201d he says, pointing out that AI agents have different sales requirements \u2014 you can\u2019t take them out to dinner or impress them with fancy slides. They demand instant information and will probably prefer interacting with another AI agent rather than a human.\nScheibenreif recommends that organizations start today to establish separate business units or sales channels to accommodate the day when \u201cbillions of machine customers come headed for your business.\u201d\n## ServiceNow shakes up competitive landscape\nSalesforce has been the unchallenged market leader in CRM for a long time. The latest IDC numbers give Salesforce 21.7% market share; the closest competitor is Microsoft with only 5.9%.\nEarlier this year, however, IT service management (ITSM) leader ServiceNow took direct aim at Salesforce by announcing, \u201cWe are in CRM.\u201d\nThe company already has a market leading customer service management (CSM) platform, but this is the first time it has positioned itself as a full-blown CRM vendor. And ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott is going all-in with a multi-front assault on Salesforce.\nHe is building alliances. \u201cServiceNow and Microsoft are expanding our alliance to accelerate disruption in the CRM category,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cThis is built on Microsoft Copilot and ServiceNow AI agent collaboration, leveraging the unique strengths of both platforms.\u201d\nAnd he is making strategic acquisitions. ServiceNow just announced that it is acquiring Moveworks for $2.8 billion, the largest deal in its history. Moveworks provides companies with ChatGPT-like AI assistants to manage organization-wide requests from employees. ServiceNow also recently bought CueIn, an AI-native conversational data analysis platform. Both acquisitions are aimed at driving agentic and generative AI adoption across the enterprise.\nNot to be outdone, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently indicated that Salesforce might be jumping into ServiceNow\u2019s ITSM market. So, expect the competition to heat up in 2025.\n## Citizen developers create AI agents\nThe low-code, no-code movement is being extended to the domain of AI so that citizen developers can create their own AI agents.\nFor example, Salesforce has released Agent Builder, which enables users to customize out-of-the-box agents or build new agents for any role, industry, or use case. Using low code or no code, Agent Builder aggregates structured and unstructured data from Data Cloud, and uses existing tools such as Flows, Prompts, Apex, and MuleSoft APIs to configure an agent.\nServiceNow has also announced ServiceNow Studio, a centralized spot for no-code and low-code developers to manage and develop agentic applications.\n## Industry clouds embrace AI and LLMs\nLeggett says that industry clouds speed time to value, fuel innovation, and create market differentiation. Forrester survey data shows that 61% of global business and technology professionals say their firm wants to increase their industry clouds.\nPopular CRM vendors such as Salesforce and Microsoft offer multiple industry clouds. The pharmaceutical company Veeva recently announced its own industry cloud for life sciences.\nAnd Leggett says, \u201cI expect vendors to announce new industry clouds, industry-specific LLMs, and new verticalized go-to-market approaches.\u201d", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nexgen-announces-best-ever-discovery-phase-intercept-at-rook-i-property-302409044.html", "text": "## News provided by\n**NexGen Energy Ltd.**\nMar 24, 2025, 06:30 ET\n## Share this article\nShare toX\nShare this article\nShare toX\n  * **RK-25-232 intersects broad zone of intense mineralization including 3.9 m of >61,000 cps**\n  * **High-grade subdomain doubles in size to 210 m strike and 335 m vertical extent**\n  * **Represents best hole drilled at any NexGen property, including Arrow, during the discovery-phase of exploration**\n\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, March 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - **NexGen Energy Ltd. (\"NexGen\" or the \"Company\")**(TSX: NXE) (NYSE: NXE) (ASX: NXG) is excited to announce the best hole drilled to date, RK-25-232 (Figures 1 and 2). This hole has materially expanded the shallow inner high-grade subdomain at Patterson Corridor East (PCE).\nContinue Reading \nDrillhole RK-25-232 intersected **3.9 meters (\"m\") of >61,000 cps, indicating rich uranium concentration within a larger 13.8 m mineralized interval** that starts at 452.2 m (Figures 3 and 4, Table 1). It is one of the shallowest high-grade intersections at PCE and open in all directions (including 300 m up dip) within the competent basement rock. Four additional winter drillholes all located a minimum 50 m from RK-25-232 have all encountered high-grade intercepts **containing >61,000 cps (**RK-25-227, -230, -233, -236) expanding the high-grade subdomain **to 210 m along strike and 335 m of vertical extent**, doubling in size since last reported in November 2024 (previously 100 m strike and 170 m vertical extent). Ongoing exploration will focus on growing and defining this high-grade zone from hole RK-25-232.\nLeigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"This intercept from RK-25-232 is geologically exceptional and represents a transformational moment taking PCE into a category to rival Arrow at the same stage of drilling. Discovering mineralization of this intensity so early in our 2025 program outpaces the success pattern experienced at the Arrow Deposit. Incredible, considering Arrow's status on the world stage. To put this into context, the width of high-grade intense mineralization in RK-25-232 at PCE was first encountered at Arrow well into the delineation phase of resource definition. Together with Arrow, it's validation a very significant regional mineralizing event has occurred at Rook I that we are only just beginning to assess the magnitude.\nToday's result comes at a time the need for Canada to optimize the development of its energy fuel resources has never been more important. NexGen, Saskatchewan and our community partners are ready to immediately commence construction of the Rook I Project subject to the completion of the CNSC approval process.\"\nJason Craven, Vice President, Exploration, commented: \"Another exciting evaluation milestone has been achieved by intersecting the surge of mineralization intensity in RK-25-232. Vein-type uranium is known to have high-grade zones within broad, structurally controlled footprints. Our focus is to expand the high-grade subdomain while also investigating for natural repetition within the evolving mineralized footprint, all of which is very similar to the approach to Arrow's resource development.\"\nThe development of PCE has advanced quickly over the past year; from an initial discovery of new vein-type basement-hosted uranium in February 2024, to a rapidly growing mineralized footprint and expanding high-grade, and now to a best-ever high-grade intersection in RK-25-232. An interpreted 3D model (Figures 1 and 2) provides a new visual representation of the scale and setting of the mineralization.\nReporting of assays from 2024 is expected in April once all results have been received and verified.\n_Table 1: 2025 Spectrometer results as of March 13_\n**Drillhole** | **Unconformity Depth (m)** | **Handheld Spectrometer Results (RS-125)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Hole ID** | **Azimuth** | **Dip** | **Total Depth (m)** | **From(m)** | **To (m)** | **Width(m)** | **CPS Range**  \nRK-25-225 | 330 | -70 | 684.0 | 108.6 | 475.00 | 475.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n479.5 | 480.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1400  \n482.0 | 482.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 850  \n482.5 | 483.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n483.5 | 484.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n484.0 | 484.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n484.5 | 485.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n498.5 | 499.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 650  \n499.0 | 499.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 830  \n509.0 | 509.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1300  \n509.5 | 510.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n510.5 | 511.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 750  \n511.0 | 511.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1800  \n517.5 | 518.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n523.0 | 523.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n523.5 | 524.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n526.5 | 527.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n539.0 | 539.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n539.5 | 540.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n540.0 | 540.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n541.0 | 541.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1600  \n541.5 | 542.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \nRK-25-226 | 330 | -70 | 655.5 | N/A  | 539.0 | 539.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n540.5 | 541.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 550  \n578.5 | 579.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n579.5 | 580.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n580.0 | 580.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 880  \n580.5 | 581.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 510  \n582.0 | 582.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n583.0 | 583.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n583.5 | 584.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 2200  \n584.0 | 584.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 980  \n586.5 | 587.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n587.0 | 587.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n589.0 | 589.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n589.5 | 590.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n590.0 | 590.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n590.5 | 591.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 730  \n591.0 | 591.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 720  \n591.5 | 592.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n592.0 | 592.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1200  \n592.5 | 593.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1280  \n593.0 | 593.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1150  \n594.0 | 594.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 890  \n594.5 | 595.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n595.0 | 595.5 | 0.5 | 1000 - 5400  \n595.5 | 596.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n596.0 | 596.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n597.5 | 598.0 | 0.5 |  <500  \n598.0 | 598.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 770  \n598.5 | 599.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 1600  \n599.0 | 599.5 | 0.5 |  <500  \n599.5 | 600.0 | 0.5 |  <500 - 510  \n600.0 | 600.5 | 0.5 |  <500 - 710  \n602.0 | 602", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eqt-announces-extension-of-expiration-date-for-exchange-offers-and-consent-solicitations-and-waiver-of-consent-threshold-condition-302408646.html", "summary": "EQT Corporation has extended the expiration date for the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations from March 24, 2025, to March 28, 2025.

Jede strategische Ver\u00e4nderung spiegelt die Ausrichtung des Unternehmens auf Branchentrends wider, w\u00e4hrend jede Gesch\u00e4ftserweiterung die globale Energiewende beschleunigt. Durch unerm\u00fcdliche Innovation und Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit wird APsystems auch weiterhin ein au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches Verm\u00e4chtnis in der Energiewende schaffen.\nContinue Reading \n**Vom Startup zum Branchenf\u00fchrer: Eine Reise der Innovation und des Wachstums**\nIm Jahr 2010 kehrten Dr. Zhimin Ling und Dr. Yuhao Luo mit einer Leidenschaft f\u00fcr die Photovoltaikindustrie nach China zur\u00fcck und gr\u00fcndeten APsystems in Jiaxing, Zhejiang. Sie erkannten von Anfang an die bedeutenden Vorteile der MLPE-Technologie (Module-Level Power Electronics) in Bezug auf Sicherheit und Effizienz und setzten sich f\u00fcr die Weiterentwicklung dieses Bereichs ein. In den letzten 15 Jahren hat APsystems einen Weg der differenzierten Produktentwicklung eingeschlagen und das Prinzip \u201eSicherheit geht vor\" in jede technische Innovation eingebettet.\nAls sich die MLPE-Technologie durchsetzte, beschleunigte sich das Wachstum von APsystems. Seit 2012 hat das Unternehmen 12 Jahre in Folge profitabel gearbeitet und expandiert. Dieses unersch\u00fctterliche Engagement hat den Nutzern \u00fcberlegene L\u00f6sungen geboten und gleichzeitig Ma\u00dfst\u00e4be f\u00fcr Sicherheit, Effizienz und Flexibilit\u00e4t in der Branche gesetzt. APsystems hat eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle bei der F\u00f6rderung globaler Photovoltaik-Standards gespielt und dazu beigetragen, die MLPE-Technologie von einer Nischenl\u00f6sung zu einer g\u00e4ngigen Wahl zu machen.\nMit seiner kontinuierlichen Gesch\u00e4ftsexpansion ist APsystems seiner Globalisierungsstrategie treu geblieben. Das Unternehmen hat erfolgreich Schl\u00fcsselm\u00e4rkte f\u00fcr Photovoltaik weltweit erschlossen und Niederlassungen in Australien, den Vereinigten Staaten, Frankreich, den Niederlanden, Mexiko und Brasilien gegr\u00fcndet. Dieses weltweite Vertriebs- und Servicenetz gew\u00e4hrleistet die fl\u00e4chendeckende Verf\u00fcgbarkeit der Produkte und Dienstleistungen von APsystems. Im Jahr 2022 deb\u00fctierte APsystems erfolgreich am STAR Market der Shanghaier B\u00f6rse und sicherte sich damit eine starke Kapitalunterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftiges Wachstum. Bis Ende 2024 wird das Unternehmen insgesamt mehr als 6 GW an MLPE-Produkten in 156 L\u00e4nder und Regionen geliefert haben. Diese Meilensteine markieren den stetigen Fortschritt von APsystems auf dem Weg zur weltweiten Branchenf\u00fchrerschaft.\n**Kernkompetenz: Ein Engagement f\u00fcr technologische Innovation**\nSeit seiner Gr\u00fcndung hat APsystems technologische Innovation in den Mittelpunkt seiner Entwicklungsstrategie gestellt und betrachtet sie als die wichtigste treibende Kraft des Unternehmens.\nIm Bereich der Mikro-Wechselrichter war APsystems das erste Unternehmen, das dreiphasige Mikro-Wechselrichter auf den Markt brachte und damit die Produktanwendungen erweiterte. Es wurden auch mehrmodulige Mikrowechselrichter entwickelt, die Leistung und Kosteneffizienz in Einklang bringen, und die 20-A-Hochstrom-Mikrowechselrichtertechnologie eingef\u00fchrt, die einen neuen Branchenma\u00dfstab setzt.\nAPsystems hat seine Investitionen in Forschung und Entwicklung kontinuierlich erh\u00f6ht und ein internationales Expertenteam zusammengestellt, das sich der unabh\u00e4ngigen Innovation im Bereich der Photovoltaik und Energiespeichertechnologien widmet. Das Unternehmen hat 178 Rechte an geistigem Eigentum erworben, darunter 89 Erfindungspatente, und ist damit branchenf\u00fchrend. Dieses langfristige Engagement f\u00fcr technologische Spitzenleistungen treibt die nachhaltige Entwicklung von APsystems weiter voran.\n**Aufbau eines umfassenden Energie-\u00d6kosystems: PV, Energiespeicherung und Aufladung**\nIm Laufe der letzten 15 Jahre hat APsystems sein Angebot \u00fcber MLPE-Produkte hinaus erweitert und ist zu einem wichtigen Akteur in den Bereichen Photovoltaik, Energiespeicherung und Ladetechnik geworden. Das Unternehmen verfolgt einen strategischen Ansatz zur Integration von Photovoltaik-, Energiespeicher- und Ladel\u00f6sungen und hat dabei drei Kerngesch\u00e4ftsbereiche geschaffen: Mikro-PV-Energiespeicher, PV-Energiespeicher f\u00fcr Privathaushalte und gewerbliche PV-Energiespeicher, die alle auf Mikro-Wechselrichtern basieren. Durch die Integration wichtiger Komponenten der Energiebranche \u2013 Solarenergieerzeugung, -speicherung und -aufladung \u2013 hat APsystems ein hocheffizientes und vernetztes Energie\u00f6kosystem geschaffen.\nDiese drei Segmente arbeiten synergetisch zusammen und verbessern Vertriebskan\u00e4le, Ressourcenverteilung und Marktkenntnisse, um der wachsenden Nachfrage gerecht zu werden. Mit der Ausweitung seiner Marktpr\u00e4senz positioniert sich APsystems f\u00fcr eine breitere globale Pr\u00e4senz.\n**KI-Integration: Aufbruch in eine neue Zukunft**\nIm Zeitalter des rasanten technologischen Fortschritts beschleunigt APsystems seinen \u00dcbergang zu einem intelligenten Energie- und KI-\u00d6kosystem. Das Unternehmen hat das \u201e+AI Application Research Institute\" gegr\u00fcndet, um KI in die Produktentwicklung, das Energiemanagement und intelligente B\u00fcro-Upgrades zu integrieren.\n  * KI-gesteuerte Algorithmen optimieren die Lade- und Entladestrategien f\u00fcr die Energiespeicherserie f\u00fcr den Wohnbereich von APsystems und maximieren so den Wert.\n  * Die APdesigner Power Station Design-Software kombiniert KI-Bilderkennung mit gro\u00dfen Sprachmodellen und verbessert so die Benutzerinteraktion und Effizienz.\n  * Regelm\u00e4\u00dfige \u201eAI Open Day\"-Veranstaltungen f\u00f6rdern die Erkundung der KI-gesteuerten Transformation von B\u00fcros.\n\n\nMit Blick auf die Zukunft wird APsystems weiterhin KI-gesteuerte Innovationen in den Bereichen Forschung und Entwicklung, Marktstrategien und Dienstleistungen ausbauen. Das Unternehmen st\u00e4rkt seine globale Pr\u00e4senz durch die Entwicklung neuer Produkte, die Akquise von Talenten und die geografische Expansion. Eine neu gegr\u00fcndete Tochtergesellschaft in Shanghai erweitert das Gesch\u00e4fts\u00f6kosystem des Unternehmens, w\u00e4hrend regionale Teams seine Position in Europa und Nordamerika festigen und aufstrebende M\u00e4rkte in Asien, Afrika und Lateinamerika erkunden.

We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\nThis comes as the U.S. has been a crucial ally for Ukraine since Russia's invasion. According to German-based think tank the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has spent just under $120 billion on Ukraine between early 2022 and December 2024. The Defense Department has put the total support for the war effort at nearly $183 billion, which includes military training in Europe and the replenishment of U.S. defense stockpiles.\nUnder the Biden administration, Zelensky was a close U.S. ally. Since taking office, however, Trump has called him a \"dictator,\" falsely claimed Ukraine started the war, and without evidence said Zelensky has a 4 percent approval rating in Ukraine.\n## What Happened During White House Meeting?\nThe White House meeting was a striking exchange of open antagonism in the Oval Office, a space typically reserved for formal diplomacy, especially among U.S. allies.\nTrump and Vance criticized Zelensky for what they saw as a lack of appreciation for U.S. aid, with Trump accusing him of \"gambling with World War III.\" Vance also told Zelensky that diplomacy was the path to peace, to which the Ukrainian leader responded by pointing out Russia's repeated violations of agreements.\n\"He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners,\" Zelensky said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about? What do you mean?\"\nVance, a vocal skeptic of continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, pushed back.\n\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" he said, later telling Zelensky, \"I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media right now.\"\u200b\nAt that point, tensions boiled over, with Trump raising his voice to the Ukrainian leader.\n\"You're gambling with World War III,\" he said. \"And what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country\u2014this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.\"\u200b\nTrump went on to say that Zelensky was not appreciative enough of U.S. military and financial aid, telling him, \"You're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing.\"\u200b\nTrump later said that Zelensky had \"disrespected\" the U.S. and declared on Truth Social that the Ukrainian leader \"is not ready for Peace.\"\nTrump has tried to make a deal with Zelensky to securing U.S. interests in Ukraine's valuable minerals and to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the war on his terms. The discussion of a path forward was cut short and Zelensky left the White House early. A press conference scheduled to take place after the meeting to announce a mineral deal was canceled.\n## What People Are Saying\n**U.S. President Donald Trump, on Truth Social on Friday:** \"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\n**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on X on Friday:** \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\n**Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on X:** \"Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all. Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.\"\n**House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN's Dana Bash:** \"What President Trump was trying to do in the Oval Office when Zelensky acted so inappropriately, in my view, was to offer them an agreement that would be a win-win across the board. The mineral rights agreement is a fantastic solution to bring about an end to this conflict and I would have hoped that President Zelensky would have understood that and showed some gratitude.\"\n## What Happens Next\nBloomberg cited a senior defense official as saying that all U.S. military equipment not currently in Ukraine will be paused, including weapons in transit on aircraft and ships or waiting in transit areas in Poland.\nThe impact of the aid stoppage will emerge in the coming days and weeks, although progress on any ceasefire talks could take much longer.\n## fairness meter\n## fairness meter\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter. \nRequest Reprint & Licensing Submit Correction View Editorial & AI Guidelines\n##  Top stories\n###  Is Donald Trump Causing a Recession?

March 2025\nPosted in JavaScript\n\u00b7 4 minutes read \nWhile I was writing this post, I wanted to create an image comparison component. I made one with just a few lines of JavaScript, but I didn't include it in the post.\nHere is the finished slider, with images from the book . If you want to play with the code, you can find it on .\nTry out the  debug mode  (I'm quite proud of it! The shadow effect is my favorite detail.) . It reveals the structure in 3D and might give you a clue as to how I managed to create the slider with only a few lines of JavaScript.\nHere's a tip - the blue element is actually a native HTML range input.\n## It's in the name #\nImage comparison _slider_. Slider, you say? We already have a native slider component - input `[type=range]`. Could we use it to make an image comparison slider? Turns out we can.\nI think that the solution I came up with is clever, yet simple to understand.\nThis is the base idea:\n  * We have two images and the range slider, stacked on each other.\n  * The range input goes from 0 to 100.\n  * As the slider is moved, we update a CSS variable to match the slider value.\n  * We use this variable to set the width of the top image.\n\n\nHere is a simplified, unstyled example. Try moving the slider to see how it works.\n## JavaScript #\nAs we saw in the example above, everything is about keeping the slider value synced with the CSS variable. This variable controls the width of the top image and the position of the separator.\nHere is the JavaScript code that keeps the `--slider-value` variable in sync with the slider value:\n```\n// Set element variables\nconst compareSlider = document.querySelector(\".comparison-slider\");\nconst input = compareSlider.querySelector(\".comparison-slider__input\");\n// Update the CSS variable on input change\ninput.addEventListener(\"input\", () => {\n compareSlider.style.setProperty(\"--slider-value\", `${input.value}%`);\n});\n// Update the CSS variable on load\n// to ensure the slider starts in sync with image's width.\ncompareSlider.style.setProperty(\"--slider-value\", `${input.value}%`);\n\n```\n\nWe could have been cheeky and shortened this code even more, but I favor readability. The code is still super short and easy to understand.\nHere is another example for good measure, this time images are from The Tiny Book of Great Joys:\n## Browser support #\nI've tested it in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on desktop, as well as Safari on mobile. It works smoothly in all of them. I'm pretty sure it will work on other browser too, but I haven't tested it myself.\nIf this post gets some traction, I'll probably clean it up and release a small library.\n## Accessibility #\nA nice thing about using native elements is that they are accessible by default. The range input is accessible and works with keyboard and screen readers. However, we need to add labels for the range input and the component itself.\nI think something like this would work well:\n```\n<div\n class=\"comparison-slider\"\n aria-label=\"\n  Image comparison slider showing [image 1 description] and [image 2 description].\n  Use the slider to compare the images.\"\n >\n <!-- Images and separator go here -->\n <label for=\"comparison-slider-input\" id=\"comparison-slider-label\">\n  Adjust slider to compare images\n </label>\n <input type=\"range\" id=\"comparison-slider-input\" aria-labelledby=\"comparison-slider-label\" />\n</div>\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion #\nI love using native features whenever possible. I even use them to solve problems beyond their intended purpose. By doing this I avoid re-implementing features that are already built in, keeping the code short and efficient.\nIf you are interested in this topic, you might like these posts too:\n  * Using CSS animations instead of JavaScript timers\n  * Native dual-range input\n\n\nShare on:\n## Menu and search\nSearch\nArt  Blog  Projects  About  Stats  RSS Feed", "title": "The author has created an image comparison slider using just a few lines of JavaScript, leveraging the native HTML range input, and has provided examples and tips for using the component, with a focus on accessibility and browser support.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "Creating an Image Comparison Slider with Native HTML Range Input\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA simple, yet clever solution for an image comparison slider utilizes the native HTML range input (`input[type=range]`).

Available to Pro users and developers worldwide.\nWe\u2019re releasing a research preview of GPT\u20114.5\u2014our largest and best model for chat yet. GPT\u20114.5 is a step forward in scaling up pre-training and post-training. By scaling unsupervised learning, GPT\u20114.5 improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.\nEarly testing shows that interacting with GPT\u20114.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater \u201cEQ\u201d make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems. We also expect it to hallucinate less.\nWe\u2019re sharing GPT\u20114.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. We\u2019re still exploring what it\u2019s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\n## Scaling unsupervised learning\nWe advance AI capabilities by scaling two complementary paradigms: unsupervised learning and reasoning. These represent two axes of intelligence.\n  1. Unsupervised learning increases world model accuracy and intuition. Models like GPT\u20113.5, GPT\u20114, and GPT\u20114.5 advance this paradigm. \n  2. _Scaling reasoning_ \u2060, on the other hand, teaches models to think and produce a chain of thought before they respond, allowing them to tackle complex STEM or logic problems. Models like OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o3\u2011mini advance this paradigm. \n\n\nGPT\u20114.5 is an example of scaling unsupervised learning by scaling up compute and data, along with architecture and optimization innovations. GPT\u20114.5 was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers. The result is a model that has broader knowledge and a deeper understanding of the world, leading to reduced hallucinations and more reliability across a wide range of topics. \n#### Scaling the GPT paradigm\nWhat was the first language?\nWe don't know exactly what the first language was, and scientists believe we'll probably never know for sure because spoken languages appeared long before written records existed.\nHere's what we do know:\n  * **No single \"first language\":** Languages likely developed gradually in different groups of humans around the same time, tens or even hundreds of thousands of years ago.\n  * **Origin in Africa:** Most scientists agree that spoken language probably first emerged among humans in Africa, perhaps over 100,000 years ago.\n  * **Proto-languages:** Rather than a single language, humans likely started with simple communication that evolved into more complex languages. The earliest forms of language probably included gestures, sounds, and signals to express basic ideas and emotions.\n  * **Lost to history:** Because speech leaves no direct fossil record, and writing emerged relatively recently (around 5,000 years ago), we have no way to know exactly how the earliest languages sounded.\n\n\nToday, linguists study existing languages to understand how they evolved over thousands of years, but the exact identity of humanity\u2019s very first language remains\u2014and will likely always remain\u2014a mystery.\n#### Deeper world knowledge\n##### \nSimpleQA Accuracy (higher is better)\n##### \nSimpleQA Hallucination Rate (lower is better)\n_SimpleQA measures LLM (large language model) factuality on straightforward but challenging knowledge questions._\n## Training for human collaboration\nAs we scale our models and they solve more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important to teach them a greater understanding of human needs and intent. For GPT\u20114.5, we developed new, scalable techniques that enable training larger and more powerful models with data derived from smaller models. These techniques improve GPT\u20114.5\u2019s steerability, understanding of nuance, and natural conversation.\n##### Comparative evaluations with human testers\n _Human preference measures the percentage of queries where testers preferred GPT\u20114.5 over GPT\u20114o._\nCombining deep understanding of the world with improved collaboration results in a model that integrates ideas naturally in warm and intuitive conversations that are more attuned to human collaboration. GPT\u20114.5 has a better understanding of what humans mean and interprets subtle cues or implicit expectations with greater nuance and \u201cEQ\u201d. GPT\u20114.5 also shows stronger aesthetic intuition and creativity. It excels at helping with writing and design.\n#### Use cases\n## GPT-4.5\nI\u2019m going through a tough time after failing a test\nAw, I'm really sorry to hear that. Failing a test can feel pretty tough and discouraging, but remember, it's just one moment\u2014not a reflection of who you are or your capabilities. Want to talk about what happened, or do you just need a distraction? I'm here either way.\nI\u2019m going through a tough time after failing a test\nI'm really sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. Here are a few things you might consider:\n1. **Reflect and Understand** : Try to analyze what might have gone wrong. Was it a lack of preparation, time management during the test, or perhaps misunderstanding the material? Understanding the root cause can help you address it in the future.\n2. **Seek Support** : Talk to someone you trust\u2014friends, family, or a school counselor. They can offer a different perspective and sometimes just talking about your feelings can be alleviating.\n3. **Speak with Your Teacher or Professor** : They can provide insights into where you might have gone wrong and offer advice on how to improve. They might also offer opportunities for make-up work or extra credit.\n4. **Develop a Study Plan** : Based on your reflections, create a plan to improve your study habits. This might include setting regular study times, breaking down material into manageable portions, or finding new study methods that work better for you.\n5. **Stay Positive and Forgive Yourself** : Mistakes and setbacks are a part of life. It\u2019s important to be kind to yourself and recognize that failure is a stepping stone to success.\n6. **Focus on the Bigger Picture** : Remember that one test is just one part of your educational journey. There will be many more opportunities to do well.\nIf you need further support or resources, consider reaching out to educational support services at your institution, or mental health resources if you\u2019re feeling particularly overwhelmed. You\u2019re not alone in this, and things can get better with time and effort.\nGPT\u20114.5 shows greater \u201cEQ\u201d and knows when to invite further conversation versus when to provide the user with extensive information.\n## GPT-4.5\nWhat's that one old painting where women set their boat on fire because they're tired of moving? I think it has to do with Rome\nYou're thinking of **\"The Trojan Women Setting Fire to Their Fleet\"** by the French painter **Claude Lorrain**. The painting depicts the Trojan women burning their own ships, exhausted from their long journey and unwilling to continue traveling after the fall of Troy. This scene is inspired by Virgil's epic poem, the _Aeneid_ , which tells the legendary story of Aeneas fleeing the destruction of Troy and eventually founding Rome.\nClaude Lorrain created this painting in **1643** , and it's renowned for its luminous depiction of fire, sea, and landscape, blending classical themes with dramatic natural beauty.\nWhat's that one old painting where women set their boat on fire because they're tired of moving? I think it has to do with Rome\nThe painting you're thinking of is likely \"The Women of Cnidus Burning the Fleet\" by Claude Lorrain.

But space exploration actually helps us address those very challenges: climate change (via satellite monitoring), resource scarcity (through asteroid mining), and existential risk (by enabling eventual multi-planetary living). It also drives technological innovation, economic growth, and inspires humanity toward collective achievement.\nWe don't explore space to escape Earth. We explore space to better understand, protect, and sustain life on Earth.\nWhat are your thoughts on space exploration?\nSpace exploration is one of the most ambitious and profound endeavors humanity has undertaken. It expands our understanding of the universe, drives technological innovation, and inspires generations to think beyond the boundaries of Earth.\nFrom a scientific perspective, space exploration helps us address fundamental questions: Are we alone in the universe? How did the cosmos begin? Can we colonize other planets? Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope, Mars rovers, and deep-space probes continuously reshape our understanding of physics, planetary science, and even biology.\nFrom a practical standpoint, space exploration fuels advancements in materials science, AI, robotics, and medicine. Many everyday technologies\u2014GPS, satellite communications, weather forecasting, and even medical imaging\u2014stem from space research.\nThere's also the existential argument: humanity's long-term survival may depend on our ability to become a multi-planetary species. While colonizing Mars or mining asteroids is far from easy, these efforts could help us safeguard civilization against existential threats like climate change or asteroid impacts.\nThat said, space exploration also raises ethical and economic questions. Should we focus more on Earth\u2019s problems before investing trillions in space? How do we prevent the same exploitative behaviors that shaped colonial history from repeating on other planets?\nOverall, I see space exploration as a necessary pursuit\u2014not at the cost of", "title": "OpenAI has released a research preview of GPT-4.5, their most advanced chat model to date, which demonstrates improved natural language understanding, a broader knowledge base, and enhanced emotional intelligence, contributing to more natural interactions and reduced factual inaccuracies.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "OpenAI is releasing a research preview of GPT-4.5, its largest and most advanced chat model yet, available to Pro users and developers worldwide.

Canadian energy products face a 10% hike, while all other Canadian goods are hit with 25%. Chinese imports, already taxed more than a month ago, now see their tariffs doubled to 20%. The scope is breathtaking: $1.3 trillion in goods are affected\u2014nearly half of all imports into the U.S. \nAmerican consumers and businesses are left to brace for the impact.\n## A Historic Disruption\nThese tariffs surpass anything seen in modern economic history. Not since the \u2014widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression\u2014has the U.S. implemented trade barriers of this magnitude. When the last thing you did is unprecedented, and the closest comparison wrecked the economy, people are understandably worried.\nThe immediate consequences are stark but predictable. Trump\u2019s tariffs have and a lull in manufacturing activity. \nEveryday essentials will cost more. Gasoline, fertilizers, steel, aluminum, and plastics\u2014important materials in manufacturing and agriculture\u2014will be more expensive. Shoppers will see price hikes on fresh produce from Mexico, including avocados, tomatoes, and limes. Electronics, from laptops to game consoles, will carry higher price tags corresponding to the tariffs placed on their country of origin. The auto industry, deeply entwined with North American supply chains, will face production slowdowns as key components become costlier.\nEconomists estimate that these tariffs will add an effective 11.5% tax to all American imports, translating to $370 billion in added costs. These costs could balloon if the Trump Administration is serious about levying , perhaps sometime in early April. The ripple effects are only beginning to unfold.\nJoseph Politano, a journalist writing about monetary policy, labor market, and finance, to show some key insights about Trump\u2019s new tariffs.\n## Who Pays Tariffs? \nIn short, the people. \nWhile shifts in exchange rates or reductions in exporter prices might mitigate some of the harm to consumers, historical evidence makes it clear that such adjustments only partially soften the blow\u2014and any relief comes at the expense of the export sector. consistently reveal that foreign exporters did not lower their prices in response to U.S. tariffs; instead, the burden of these tariffs fell squarely on U.S. importers, who then have to pass on the tax to consumers. \nSeveral factors could drive costs even higher than currently estimated. Most notably, domestic producers competing with newly tariffed imports are likely to raise their prices in tandem with the rising costs of imports. This would compound the financial strain on U.S. consumers, pushing up their expenses. Overall, the combination of higher prices, recessionary pressures from retaliatory measures, and supply chain disruptions would deliver a significant blow to the majority of U.S. households.\nAlthough Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to lower taxes, the reality of his policies so far suggests that most Americans would face a net increase in their tax burden. Both Trump and congressional Republicans have focused on extending the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)\u2014cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025\u2014but this alone would not shield most households from the negative impacts of tariffs. Only households in the top 20 percent of the income distribution would see a net benefit from the combined effects of these tax policies (income lost to tariff-related price hikes and income gained from income tax reduction). Meanwhile, those in the bottom 60 percent would find themselves significantly worse off.\n## The Hardest-Hit States\nThe impact of these tariffs is not distributed evenly across the United States. Some states stand to suffer disproportionately, , an economist at the University of Minnesota Duluth. \nTexas, the nation\u2019s energy and trade powerhouse, is poised to lose $15.3 billion annually due to its closer ties with Mexico. California, with its diverse economy and reliance on international supply chains, could take a $10.2 billion hit. Michigan, where the auto industry is king, faces a $6.2 billion economic blow as a result of trade friction with Canada. \nIn total, the U.S. economy may see losses exceeding $109 billion per year, Tadesse found. And these numbers don\u2019t even account for retaliatory tariffs\u2014set to arrive from Canada and China within days.\nFor smaller states, the per-capita burden is even heavier. New Mexico, Kentucky, and Indiana are set to lose between 1.1% and 1.5% of their GDP. For New Mexico residents, that means an estimated personal financial hit of $822 per person\u2014roughly three months\u2019 worth of grocery bills.\nHouseholds across the country will feel the sting. Four-person families in Kentucky may need to budget an extra $3,120 annually to cover increased costs. In Indiana, the impact is estimated at $2,836 per household. Even in wealthier states like Texas, where incomes are higher and the internal economy is better shielded against tariffs, the added burden exceeds $2,000 per family.\nsuggests tariffs will cost the average American household over $1,200 a year.\n\u201cThe new Trump tariff regime represents a fundamental shift in how the U.S. engages with its closest economic partners. While ostensibly meant to strengthen American industry, the tariffs on offer have serious side effects that will likely cause widespread disruptions for businesses, consumers and entire state economies,\u201d Tadesse wrote in a blog post on _The Conversation_.\n\u201cTrade isn\u2019t just about numbers on a spreadsheet. It\u2019s about real people, real businesses and the intricate economic fabric that connects the nation. Changes to this system can come at a high price. Safeguarding American jobs and ensuring economic stability entails recognizing the realities of global trade and considering the trade-offs of instituting new policies.\u201d\n## Industries at Risk\nThe auto industry is among the most vulnerable. Car parts cross borders multiple times before reaching final assembly. Now, that seamless flow is grinding to a halt. Economists estimate the disruption could cost automakers $28 billion, threatening nearly 700,000 jobs.\nThe agricultural sector is also on edge. Retaliatory tariffs from Mexico, Canada, and China could strike hard at American farmers, particularly those exporting corn, beef, and dairy. The echoes of the 2018-2019 U.S.-China trade war\u2014when American farmers suffered $27 billion in losses\u2014are impossible to ignore. Back then, soybean exports to China collapsed by 71%. History may be poised to repeat itself.\nManufacturers face another battle: rising costs for raw materials. Steel and aluminum, already subject to tariffs in Trump\u2019s first term, are now even more expensive. Factories will either absorb the hit\u2014shrinking profits\u2014or pass the costs onto consumers. Either way, the economic pain deepens.\n## What even is the purpose?\nUnlike previous trade battles, this one lacks clear objectives. The Trump administration claims tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raise tax revenue and grow the economy. But according to a , Trump\u2019s tariffs reduced manufacturing employment in affected industries. By all economic indicators, this seems to be a gross miscalculation.\nThe threat of tariffs has also been seen as leverage against Canada and Mexico to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, yet no real negotiations with Canada or Mexico preceded the move. There are no exemptions for critical goods like energy or medical supplies. The broad nature of these tariffs suggests a political posture rather than a calculated industrial policy.\nThe international response has been swift. Canada has already hit back with $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs. China\u2019s countermeasures, affecting $22 billion in American exports, take effect next week. More retaliation looms. Mexico is preparing its own trade barriers. Canada is considering an additional $86 billion in tariffs. Some Canadian leaders are even discussing halting electricity exports to the U.S. border states.\nFor American businesses, the instability is chilling. Trade depends on trust. If you can\u2019t count on agreements holding, companies hesitate to invest, expand, or hire. \nThis is odd since Trump himself championed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal during his first term\u2014yet now, he\u2019s dismantling it unilaterally. Even if these tariffs are lifted in the future, the confidence in trade partnerships may take years to rebuild.\nThere are now winners and losers in trade wars. There are only losers. Inflation is inevitable, and so are higher interest rates to control the resulting inflation. \nTariffs may be a blunt instrument for reshaping economic policy, but they come with consequences. For now, those consequences are unfolding in grocery stores, gas stations, and factory floors across the country. The question is no longer whether the tariffs will hurt. The question is: how much damage will they do before the policy changes?\n#### Related Posts\n  * If there\u2019s any life in the Trappist-1 system it\u2019s likely been planet-hopping, scientists say\n  * Dwarf Planet Ceres reveals its colors, but keeps its secrets\n\n\n  * Doomsday part 6: asteroid strike\n  * Bowhead whales\u2019 can repair their DNA \u2014 and this possibly makes them cancer-resistant\n\n\n### Recent news\n### China released an open source kung-fu robot and we\u2019re not really sure why\nMarch 5, 2025\n### Hominins in Africa were shaping bone tools as early as 1.5 million years ago\nMarch 5, 2025\n### AI Is Deciphering Ancient Inscriptions That Experts Have Struggled With for Centuries\nMarch ", "title": "Trump's unprecedented tariffs on $1.3 trillion in imports impose 25% on Mexico and Canada, 20% on China, driving annual household costs up to $3,200 and causing $109 billion in state economic losses.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "The Trump administration's newly imposed tariffs, effective March 4, 2025, are set to significantly impact the US economy.

According to the court, the language of the 2nd Amendment played a role in their decision. Specifically, \u201cthe rights of the people\u201d was at play. The court ruled that people under 21 years old, who are currently unable to purchase handguns, are \u201cpeople\u201d and thus the Amendment applies to them. Judges in other states such as Virginia, Minnesota, and Texas have struck down similar laws on gun purchase age restrictions. However, given the rising levels of political and social unrest throughout the country, many critics worry that this move could be potentially harmful for people in those communities. (Can you guess which state has the weakest gun control laws?)\nAs conversations around gun laws and gun control continue to progress, it\u2019s important to remain informed. But since gun laws vary on state and local levels, it can be difficult to answer even the most basic of questions. 24/7 Wall St. has taken a deep dive into the most common gun law questions and done our best to answer them for you. To formulate these questions, we looked at the most frequently asked questions on forums, as well as data and information from sources like the ATF, Everytown Research & Policy, and the U.S. Department of Justice. However, please note that the answers to most of these questions vary based on state and local laws, and are hard to give definitive answers for. \n## **Why Are We Covering Gun Laws?**\nSince 30% of Americans currently own a gun, it\u2019s important to know the laws and regulations around gun ownership in your local area. Furthermore, out of people who don\u2019t own a firearm today, 36% say they could see themselves owning a gun in the future. Additionally, the rate of deadly gun violence in an area can negatively affect the economy. Housing markets, local businesses, and job opportunities can decline when an area is seen as too violent. But you can\u2019t be part of conversations around gun control or gun laws if you\u2019re not informed. \n**Here are 22 questions about gun laws that most Americans can\u2019t answer:**\n## **22. Question: Public Transportation**\nCan you legally carry a firearm on public transportation? \n## **Answer: Maybe**\nThe answer to this question depends on the state and the public transportation system. For example, Chicago prohibits firearms on any public transportation method, and the same goes for all of Amtrak\u2019s train lines. If you\u2019re looking to transport a gun, check the local rules and regulations first so you don\u2019t get in trouble. \n## **21. Question: Service Member Laws**\nAre active-duty service members exempt from any gun laws that apply to civilians? \n## **Answer: No**\nIf a military member is off duty, they are required to follow all civilian gun laws. While on duty, service members must adhere to military regulations regarding firearms. Either way, they\u2019re not exempt from any rules or regulations. \n## **20. Question: Gun Ownership and Misdemeanors**\nCan someone be denied gun ownership if they have a misdemeanor conviction? \n## **Answer: Yes and No**\nIn the case of someone who has been convicted of a misdemeanor for domestic violence, these individuals are prohibited from owning a firearm. In some states, the same restrictions apply to anyone convicted of stalking or repeated DUI. However, in other cases, loopholes exist for someone with a misdemeanor on their record to own a firearm. \n## **19. Question: Machine Gun Ownership**\nAre you legally able to own a machine gun in the United States? \n## **Answer: In Strict Cases**\nFor the most part, any machine gun manufactured before May 19, 1986 can be legally owned in the United States per the National Firearms Act. Owning these weapons would require ATF registration, an extensive background check, and a $200 tax payment. Machine guns manufactured after this date are prohibited from civilian ownership. \n## **18. Question: Crimes and Manufacturers**\nCan a gun manufacturer be sued if a manufactured firearm is used in a crime? \n## **Answer: No, With Exceptions**\nThis has long been a heated legal issue. But the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) protects firearms manufacturers and dealers against lawsuits. However, in the case of the Sandy Hook shooting, families of the victims did successfully win a lawsuit against Remington Firearms with the argument that the company\u2019s deceptive marketing tactics played a role in the shooting. \n## **17. Question: Felonies and Gun Ownership**\nCan someone who has previously been convicted of a felony own and or carry a firearm? \n## **Answer: No**\nThis is a pretty easy one. Federal law has been in place for a while, indicating that anyone convicted of a felony in the past, regardless of the crime, is prohibited from owning a firearm. There are cases in which felons can have their gun ownership rights restored, but doing so requires significant legal work, and success varies by state. \n## **16. Question: Ammunition Sales**\nDo you need to have a federal firearms license to sell ammunition legally? \n## **Answer: No**\nFederal law does not currently mandate having a license to sell standard ammunition to the public. However, any seller is responsible for ensuring that a potential buyer is not restricted from owning firearms. Also, states like California mandate that a background check be undertaken for ammunition purchases. \n## **15. Question: State Lines**\nCan you legally take a firearm across state lines? \n## **Answer: Yes**\nThis is among the most essential and simple questions many Americans get wrong. Under the Firearm Owners Protection Act, an individual can transport a firearm across state lines if used for a lawful purpose and locked in a container. However, anyone crossing state lines must be familiar with the laws of any state they enter, as individual state laws vary, especially around reciprocity for concealed carry permits. \n## **14. Question: College Campuses**\nCan guns be carried on a college campus? \n## **Answer: Yes, In Some States**\nThe short answer to this question is yes, especially in places like Texas, where guns can be legally carried openly without a permit. However, this law gets significantly tighter in states like California, where firearms are strictly prohibited on college campuses unless carried by members of law enforcement. \n## **13. Question: Magazine Capacity Limits**\nAre there any limits on magazine capacity? \n## **Answer: Yes, In Certain States**\nAs of September 2023, 14 states and Washington, D.C. have enabled magazine capacity restrictions. In many states, the maximum allowed capacity is between 10 and 20 rounds. For example, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont all limit magazines to 10 rounds, while Vermont also extends this rule to handguns to just 15 rounds. \n## **12. Question: Bump Stocks**\nBump stocks are frequently in the news. Are they legal? \n## **Answer: No**\nWhile bump stocks are still found in the wild, they have been federally banned since 2018. The popularity of this weapon enhancement enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire rapidly, and its use has been under a microscope after being used in several mass shootings in recent years. \n## **11. Question: Gun Show Rules**\nCan you purchase a firearm at a gun show without requiring a background check? \n## **Answer: Not Really**\nPer federal law, anyone with a Federal Firearms License (FFL), such as a gun store or other licensee who might sell at a gun show, must perform a background check on any buyer and keep detailed records about the sale. In Florida, this isn\u2019t necessarily true, as you can purchase a firearm at a gun show without any background check due to a loophole known as the \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d \n## **10. Question: Ammunition Restriction**\nAre there any restrictions on the type of ammunition a single buyer can purchase? \n## **Answer: Yes**\nFor example, a buyer in the United States cannot purchase or own armor-piercing ammunition due to a federal ban. Federal law also bans handgun ammunition from being sold to anyone under 21 years of age. There are also state limitations based on magazine capacity and locations like California that require a background check on most ammunition purchases. \n## **9. Question: Silencers and Gun Suppressors**\nCan someone not in law enforcement or the military use a silencer or gun suppressor? \n## **Answer: Yes**\nThis is a murky one because the short answer is yes: 42 states allow suppressors to be used in conjunction with private firearms. However, to do so, you must register under the National Firearms Act, pay a $200 tax, and submit to an even more extensive background check. \n## **8. Question: Making Your Own Gun**\nAre you legally allowed to make your firearms? \n## **Answer: Yes**\nThis is a tough question as the guidelines vary and are coming under increasing scrutiny, especially as 3D printing becomes more popular. This is because 3D printing allows people to manufacture guns that can pass through metal detectors, which presents a safety issue. However, making firearms for personal use is legal if the individual complies with federal laws. Any gun manufactured privately must be legally registered with a serial number. \n## **7. Question: Assault Weapon Ban**\nAre assault weapons banned nationwide? \n## **Answer: No**\nThis question often confuses many Americans, as President Bill Clinton had previously enacted a 10-year ban on assault weapons. However, this ban expired in 2004, which allowed states like New York, California, and Connecticut to enact their restrictions on assault weapons. \n## **6. Question: Waiting Periods**\nWhat is the current federal waiting period to purchase and own a firearm? \n", "title": "A New Orleans court struck down age-based handgun purchase restrictions citing the 2nd Amendment, while 24/7 Wall St. details state-level gun law variations including magazine limits, campus carry rules, and federal firearm regulations.", "summary": "A New Orleans-based appeals court recently ruled that banning handgun sales to people between 18 and 21 years old violates the 2nd Amendment, as _the rights of the people_ applies to all, including those under 21. Similar laws have been struck down in Virginia, Minnesota, and Texas. This move raises concerns about potential harm to communities amidst rising social unrest.\n\n- **Key Gun Law Questions and Answers:**\n\n  - **Carrying Firearms on Public Transportation:** Depends on the state and transportation system.\n\n  - **Machine Gun Ownership:** Allowed for pre-1986 models with ATF registration and a $200 tax.\n\n  - **Felony and Gun Ownership:** No, federal law prohibits felons from owning firearms.\n\n  - **Crossing State Lines with Firearms:** Yes, if used for lawful purposes and locked in a container.\n\n  - **College Campus Gun Carry Laws:** Vary by state (e.g., allowed in Texas, prohibited in California).\n\nConcerns about gun laws and control are heightened, especially with 30% of Americans owning guns and the potential economic impact of gun violence on local communities.

AI is no longer a futuristic promise; it's actively shaping developers' workflows today. Think of AI as a skilled mid-level engineer in the developer's workshop -- ready to handle the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that often bog down creativity. We are seeing a shift in responsibilities, with AI taking over coding tasks and developers focusing on higher-level tasks that require creativity and problem-solving. Like a skilled worker sharpens tools and prepares materials so a master craftsman can focus on innovation, AI enhances how we build, test, and maintain software.\nDevelopers are not being replaced but empowered. AI tools take on routine work, allowing teams to think more significantly, move faster, and create with greater precision. This partnership between human ingenuity and machine precision redefines what's possible in software development.\n## **The Landscape of AI in Development Today**\nAI is already delivering measurable impact. According to a 2023 O'Reilly study, 51% of organizations were using AI-assisted development tools, a number that continues to climb. These tools go beyond automating mundane tasks; they optimize code, identify and fix bugs, and accelerate testing cycles. AI has proven itself as more than a buzzword -- it's a practical, reliable partner in the development lifecycle.\nFor example, consider automated bug fixing. Developers no longer have to spend hours combing through lines of code to find a single mistake. AI tools identify errors, suggest fixes, and, in some cases, implement them automatically. Once a bottleneck in release cycles, testing has also been transformed by AI's ability to simulate environments, predict failure points, and flag vulnerabilities in record time.\n### **The Role of the Developer 's Partner**\nAI as a partner resonates deeply because it captures how this technology fits into development teams. It's not about replacing the developer but enhancing their craft. AI helps bridge skill gaps, allowing junior developers to produce work that meets senior-level expectations. Reducing human error in complex processes raises the bar for quality and consistency across the board.\nAI is a game changer in fast-paced DevOps environments, where release cycles are tighter than ever. It handles repetitive tasks like code reviews and performance optimizations, freeing developers to focus on the work that truly drives innovation.\n### **Real-World Applications and Opportunities**\nAI's potential isn't just theoretical -- it's being realized across organizations of every size and industry -- demonstrating significant benefits in software development and maintenance. For instance:\nA study on GitHub Copilot revealed that developers who utilized the AI tool for code generation and suggestions increased their speed by 55%.\nImplementing AI-powered predictive maintenance systems in the manufacturing sector led to a 40% decrease in unplanned downtime, enhancing production efficiency and output.\nFrom startups to enterprises, AI is becoming a quiet but transformative force. It's not flashy, but its impact is undeniable. Developers are discovering that by embracing these tools, they can do more than meet deadlines -- they can exceed expectations.\n### **Challenges and Limitations**\nOf course, AI isn't without its challenges. Developers must remain in control, guiding these tools to ensure accuracy and avoid unintended consequences like bias or overlooked errors. This requires technical expertise and a willingness to adapt and learn.\nEthical considerations are also involved. As AI assumes more responsibility, questions arise: Where do we draw the line between human creativity and machine contribution? How do we ensure AI-driven tools remain secure and transparent? The industry needs to have these conversations soon.\n## **The Future of AI in Development**\nLooking ahead, AI's role in development will only grow. We can expect deeper integration with DevOps pipelines, tools enabling non-technical contributors to participate in development, and increasingly sophisticated algorithms anticipating developers' needs.\nThis evolution doesn't threaten the role developer role; it enhances it. AI will continue to be a strong partner, empowering developers to focus on the bigger picture -- solving problems, driving innovation, and creating the technologies of tomorrow.\nAI isn't here to replace developers but to amplify their impact. By taking on the routine and the repetitive, AI allows developers to be more creative, agile, and precise. The partnership between humans and machines ushers in a new era for software development, in which possibilities are expanded, and innovation knows no bounds.\nThe post From Automation to Optimization: AI\u2019s Expanding Role in Software Development appeared first on The New Stack.", "title": "AI transforms software development by automating coding tasks and enhancing productivity, as seen in GitHub Copilot's 55% speed boost, while raising ethical and control considerations for developers.", "summary": "The software development landscape is undergoing a significant shift with AI actively shaping developers' workflows.

Through this collaboration, both SHEIN and Transfar Chemicals aim to accelerate the commercialization and application of scientific advancements of textile production and dyeing processes.\nThe collaboration will focus on initiatives in three key areas:\n  1. Digitalization of dyeing and textile finishing processes that reduce energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions.\n  2. The development of new functional fabrics and garments that meet the needs of modern consumers. Examples of functional fabrics include stretch fabric and water-repellent material.\n  3. The development of testing methods for new textile materials, garment products, or processes that help ensure consistency in testing for safety, quality and performance.\n\n\nThis partnership will leverage on both SHEIN and Transfar Chemicals' complementary strengths in textile fabric technology and product resources. SHEIN will be able to leverage its digitalized supply chain platform to monitor demand for premium fabrics and new production technologies. Meanwhile, Transfar Chemicals can draw on its expertise in functional chemistry to support the promotion and development of innovative processes, materials, and textile production and dyeing methods that are aimed at reducing water, energy and waste.\nAs part of its goal of modernizing the textile dyeing and finishing industry, SHEIN will also support and encourage industrial collaborations between Transfar Chemicals and regional textile and dyeing enterprises, in order to support the commercialization of Transfar Chemical's research.\nThis will not only enable SHEIN to meet the industry's demand for premium high-quality textiles but also ensure that it has the capabilities to stay at the forefront of industry trends.\nSHEIN has been leveraging on its digitalized, on-demand supply chain that addresses the mismatch between demand from consumers and merchandise supply and aims to reduce excess inventory by reducing textile waste from the start. At the same time, SHEIN is working to integrate innovative solutions - such as polyester recycling and waterless printing - into its operational processes. \nEarlier this year, SHEIN announced the development of an innovative polyester recycling process in partnership with Donghua University. This polyester recycling process accepts a wider range of materials, such as textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, and as a result, improved cost efficiency compared to the recycled polyester options currently used in SHEIN's products. Initial tests by the project team also indicated that the recycled polyester fabrics produced through this process can be recycled repeatedly without significant impact on the material properties of the resulting fabric. SHEIN is currently working on scaling up the technology from a laboratory-scale setting to a facility capable of producing recycled polyester fibres at a larger commercial scale.\nSOURCE SHEIN\n## WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM?\n440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers \n9k+ Digital Media Outlets \n270k+ Journalists Opted In \nGET STARTED\n### Modal title\n## Also from this source\n### SHEIN SPREADS SMILES WORLDWIDE WITH LAUNCH OF NEWMOJI\u00ae AND SMILEYWORLD\u00ae COLLECTIONS \nGet ready to smile big!

I believe AI is a genuine productivity tool. By which I mean it can make developers produce more.\n##  Learn faster. Dig deeper. See farther. \nJoin the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful.\nLearn more\nThe question is whether those developers are producing something good or not.\nThe difference between an experienced developer and a junior is that an experienced developer knows:\n  * There\u2019s more than one good solution to every problem.\n  * The answer to \u201cwhat\u2019s the solution\u201d is \u201cit depends.\u201d\n  * What \u201cit depends\u201d on, or at least has a handle on how to find out what it depends on.\n\n\nThe way we train juniors, whether it\u2019s at university or in a boot camp or whether they train themselves from the materials we make available to them (Long Live the Internet), we imply from the very beginning that there\u2019s a correct answer. \u201cThis is the solution for printing the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.\u201d Junior developers are trained to think that if the code solves the problem, the job is finished.\nHowever, what we do in software development usually _hasn\u2019t_ been done before. If it has, it\u2019s usually codified into a language, framework, or library.\nWhat does this have to do with AI? Currently, generative AI gives you The Answer. As AI improves, it will probably even give you an answer that works. This is great! We no longer need to spend loads of time training developers; we can train them to be \u201cprompt engineers\u201d (which makes me think of developers who arrive on time), and they will ask the AI for the code, and it will deliver.\nBut it\u2019s more complicated than that. Assuming the first answer the AI gives us compiles and works, it may not match our code style; it may not use the libraries and frameworks the team has available to them; it may not take into account the peculiarities of the business domain of our specific application; it may not meet our performance requirements. An experienced developer would spot all of this and either ask the AI to massage the answer into the correct shape or do it themselves. A junior developer may be tempted to shoehorn this code into the application in whichever way works.\nI want to be very clear here. I do not blame junior developers for this. This is part of learning. We\u2019ve been doing this for decades. When I graduated with my computer science degree, I was using AltaVista (yes, I am that old) to find solutions to my problems and poking the code until it did what I wanted, often in spite of whatever tools, frameworks, or design patterns we were using. Later, juniors were using code from Stack Overflow as inspiration, blissfully unaware of which lines they pasted into the code base were doing nothing and which were actually relevant. These days, those pasted lines of code will be code created by generative AI.\nOur responsibility as an industry has always been to steer newly minted developers in the right direction. It\u2019s always been important for experienced engineers to point out the disadvantages of an approach and to show juniors better or newer ways of doing things. I still clearly remember a developer, only two years my senior, explaining to me why I should be using `ArrayList` and not `Vector`. Growing as an engineer is not about learning to write more code; it\u2019s about learning which questions to ask, what are the compromises and \u201cit depends\u201d issues, and which solutions might be correct ones for a given problem.\nSo, let\u2019s get back to why I\u2019m worried about AI. I\u2019m worried that experienced developers will add it to their arsenal of tools to get the job done, just like IDE code completion, Stack Overflow, and Google. They will learn how (and when) to use it to give them ideas, point them in a direction, and do the heavy lifting of creating boilerplate or chunks of common code. They will learn how to coach the AI to give them \u201cbetter\u201d code (for some definition of better) over time. All this time, they\u2019re training the AI: they\u2019re not training junior developers. In fact, experienced engineers are being encouraged to train generative AI in a way they were _never_ encouraged to invest time in training juniors.\nAnd juniors\u2014well, juniors will assume the AI-generated code works. The experienced engineers will be so busy training the AI that they won\u2019t be helping the juniors level up. Juniors won\u2019t have the tools to improve, and senior developers might spend so much time fixing bugs in poorly implemented code from the juniors that the organization might decide that juniors are not only not needed but actually an undesirable productivity drain.\nWhat\u2019s the problem? Surely whether we\u2019re training juniors or training the AI, the end result is the same? Code that works for our problem. Sure, and as AI gets better, perhaps we will rely on it even more. And let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that AI does improve enough to replace junior developers. Will it become good enough to replace experienced developers? Maybe, but we\u2019re definitely not there yet. If it\u2019s not good enough to replace experienced developers and architects, and if we don\u2019t invest in today\u2019s juniors, we won\u2019t have any seniors tomorrow. We will need experienced developers for the foreseeable future, even if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d to train the AI or help create the next generation of AI tools.\nBeyond the pipeline problem, I want to address something that I think is very often overlooked in our industry. Developers are not code-production machines. Our job is not to type code. I don\u2019t just mean experienced developers; I include juniors in this too. When I worked in a team that paired regularly, when I was a developer with a solid 10+ years\u2019 experience, the people who challenged me the most were the juniors. Yes, I learned a _great_ deal from smart, experienced people like Dave Farley and Martin Thompson. What I learned from them was often new stuff I didn\u2019t already know, or they confirmed beliefs and ideas I already had. But the juniors, they were the ones that really helped me to understand what I cared about and why I did the things I did. Juniors really challenge you as a developer. Juniors ask great questions: Why did you do it that way? Why did you reject this idea? What are you thinking about when you\u2019re trying to decide which of these approaches to take? Why is it hard to make this test pass?\nThese questions help us to grow as mid- and senior-level developers. Why _did_ we do it that way? Is it because once upon a time someone showed us to do it that way, and we\u2019ve just blindly followed that approach? Or did we discover, after extensive Googling and searching on Stack Overflow, after a lot of trial and error and eventual refinement, that this is the best way to do it? The answer to that will tell us a lot about how much we understand this thing and whether we understand the trade-offs we\u2019re making when we take that route. It should also make us think about whether we need to do more research on this approach or tool\u2014Has it been updated since we learned this approach? Is there a newer/better/faster/cleaner way to do the same thing?\nOf course we could just sit there pondering these questions in silence and then carry on doing whatever we were doing (or decide to do things differently). But verbalizing the inner conversation, the doubts or certainties we have about the answers, will not only give the junior some insight into our thought processes but help them create their own process for making decisions. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, really. I\u2019ve just always done it that way. Should we do a bit of research on whether there\u2019s a better way?\u201d Or \u201cWell, back in my last job, we had a limit on the number of open connections, so I always close them when I can. That doesn\u2019t apply as much here, but it seems like a good habit anyway. Can you think of a reason not to do this?\u201d It\u2019s good to ask the juniors questions to get them thinking, and it\u2019s great to have a two-way conversation about trade-offs and implementation decisions. Goodness knows we\u2019ve all been stuck thinking in circles about a problem, only to solve it just by asking a question. (We often don\u2019t even need the answer!)\nSeniors know the answer to everything is \u201cit depends.\u201d Growing as a developer means discovering more and more things \u201cit depends\u201d on, being able to spot those things in the code, the infrastructure, or the organization, and asking questions to uncover known unknowns. Answering a junior\u2019s questions, or guiding them to their own answer, helps them on their own journey to finding out what \u201cit depends\u201d on and where to strike the balance in the trade-offs. It also helps us to better understand our own processes and update them where necessary.\nAn AI doesn\u2019t ask questions. It gives answers. With confidence. It does not challenge you. It bows to your wisdom when you express an opinion and yet also does what the hell it wants to.\nWe need the tension between seniors and juniors. That\u2019s what helps us all grow. As juniors, we can ask questions, learning for ourselves and helping the seniors challenge their assumptions. As seniors, we have a lot more experience with the subtleties of why we would choose a specific solution and what preferences we, or our team, might have on our solution. But while we can mould an AI to give us the sort of answer we ourselves might have written, the AI is not going to ask us, \u201cBut why do you want to do it that way?\u201d or \u201c", "title": "Trisha Gee warns that over-reliance on AI in software development risks undermining mentorship between senior and junior developers, critical for fostering expertise and challenging assumptions in code decision-making.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "Concerns about AI in Software Development\n\nTrisha Gee expresses worry about AI's impact on software development, not due to job replacement, but rather the potential hindrance to junior developers' growth.

Through this collaboration, both SHEIN and Transfar Chemicals aim to accelerate the commercialization and application of scientific advancements of textile production and dyeing processes.\nThe collaboration will focus on initiatives in three key areas:\n  1. Digitalization of dyeing and textile finishing processes that reduce energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions.\n  2. The development of new functional fabrics and garments that meet the needs of modern consumers. Examples of functional fabrics include stretch fabric and water-repellent material.\n  3. The development of testing methods for new textile materials, garment products, or processes that help ensure consistency in testing for safety, quality and performance.\n\n\nThis partnership will leverage on both SHEIN and Transfar Chemicals' complementary strengths in textile fabric technology and product resources. SHEIN will be able to leverage its digitalized supply chain platform to monitor demand for premium fabrics and new production technologies. Meanwhile, Transfar Chemicals can draw on its expertise in functional chemistry to support the promotion and development of innovative processes, materials, and textile production and dyeing methods that are aimed at reducing water, energy and waste.\nAs part of its goal of modernizing the textile dyeing and finishing industry, SHEIN will also support and encourage industrial collaborations between Transfar Chemicals and regional textile and dyeing enterprises, in order to support the commercialization of Transfar Chemical's research.\nThis will not only enable SHEIN to meet the industry's demand for premium high-quality textiles but also ensure that it has the capabilities to stay at the forefront of industry trends.\nSHEIN has been leveraging on its digitalized, on-demand supply chain that addresses the mismatch between demand from consumers and merchandise supply and aims to reduce excess inventory by reducing textile waste from the start. At the same time, SHEIN is working to integrate innovative solutions - such as polyester recycling and waterless printing - into its operational processes. \nEarlier this year, SHEIN announced the development of an innovative polyester recycling process in partnership with Donghua University. This polyester recycling process accepts a wider range of materials, such as textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, and as a result, improved cost efficiency compared to the recycled polyester options currently used in SHEIN's products. Initial tests by the project team also indicated that the recycled polyester fabrics produced through this process can be recycled repeatedly without significant impact on the material properties of the resulting fabric. SHEIN is currently working on scaling up the technology from a laboratory-scale setting to a facility capable of producing recycled polyester fibres at a larger commercial scale.\nLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2266792/image_5026813_4105828_Logo.jpg\n## WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM?\n440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers \n9k+ Digital Media Outlets \n270k+ Journalists Opted In \nGET STARTED\n### Modal title\n## Also from this source\n### SHEIN and Transfar Chemicals Enter into Partnership Agreement to Foster Research in Textile Innovation \nSHEIN, a global online fashion and lifestyle retailer, and Transfar Chemicals, a leader in functional chemistry and new materials technology, have...\n### SHEIN SPREADS SMILES WORLDWIDE WITH LAUNCH OF NEWMOJI\u00ae AND SMILEYWORLD\u00ae COLLECTIONS \nGet ready to smile big!

Though a few different technologies exist in these fields, dynamic facial projection mapping (DFPM) is among the most sophisticated and visually stunning ones. Briefly put, DFPM consists of projecting dynamic visuals onto a person's face in real-time, using advanced facial tracking to ensure projections adapt seamlessly to movements and expressions.\nWhile imagination should ideally be the only thing limiting what's possible with DFPM in AR, this approach is held back by technical challenges. Projecting visuals onto a moving face implies that the DFPM system can detect the user's facial features, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, within less than a millisecond.\nEven slight delays in processing or minuscule misalignments between the camera's and projector's image coordinates can result in projection errors\u2014or \"misalignment artifacts\"\u2014that viewers can notice, ruining the immersion.\nAgainst this backdrop, a research team from Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan, set out to find solutions to existing challenges in DFPM. Led by Associate Professor Yoshihiro Watanabe and also including graduate student Mr. Hao-Lun Peng, the team introduced a series of innovative strategies and techniques and combined them into a state-of-the-art high-speed DFPM system. Their findings were on January 17, 2025.\nFirst, the researchers developed a hybrid technique called the \"high-speed face tracking method\" that combines two different approaches in parallel to detect facial landmarks in real-time. They employed a method called Ensemble of Regression Trees (ERT) to realize fast detection.\nThey also implemented a way to efficiently crop incoming pictures down to the user's face to detect landmarks faster; they achieved this by leveraging temporal information from previous frames to limit the \"search area.\" To help ERT-based detection recover from errors or challenging situations, they combined it with a slower auxiliary method, which provides high accuracy at a lower speed.\nUsing this ingenious strategy, the researchers achieved unprecedented speed in DFPM. \"By integrating the results of high-precision but slow detection and low-precision but fast detection techniques in parallel and compensating for temporal discrepancies, we reached a high-speed execution at just 0.107 milliseconds while maintaining high accuracy,\" says Watanabe.\nThe team also tackled a pressing problem: the limited availability of video datasets of facial movements for training the models. They created an innovative method to simulate high-frame-rate video annotations using existing still image facial datasets. This allowed their algorithms to properly learn motion information at high frame rates.\nFinally, the researchers proposed a lens-shift co-axial projector-camera setup to help minimize alignment artifacts. \"The lens-shift mechanism incorporated into the camera's optical system aligns it with the upward projection of the projector's optical system, leading to more accurate coordinate alignment,\" explains Watanabe. In this way, the team achieved high optical alignment with only a 1.274-pixel error for users located between 1 m and 2 m depth.\nOverall, the various methods developed in this study will help push the field of DFPM forward, leading to more compelling and hyper-realistic effects that will transform performances, fashion shows, and artistic presentations.\n**More information:** Hao-Lun Peng et al, Perceptually-Aligned Dynamic Facial Projection Mapping by High-Speed Face-Tracking Method and Lens-Shift Co-Axial Setup, _IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics_ (2025). \nProvided by Institute of Science Tokyo\n**Citation** : High-speed face tracking enhances augmented reality experiences (2025, February 20) retrieved 21 February 2025 from https://techxplore.com/news/2025-02-high-tracking-augmented-reality.html \nThis document is subject to copyright.

Having an understanding of your coworkers\u2019 performance means that you understand what they do, and understanding what they do is critical to making sure you collaborate with them effectively. This is especially important if you\u2019re in a leadership role or a cross-functional team. Also, raising the alarm on peer underperformance can be both necessary and highly impactful.\n## A Sad Story\nIn the early days of a startup, teams are in survival mode - if you\u2019re not pulling your weight, we\u2019re not sharing food with you. Startups that became successful rarely stifled peer feedback in the early days.\nThen you hire more vocations. As you add PM and Design and Product Marketing, you eventually hit your first conflict between these groups. It\u2019s usually an engineer alleging that another vocation is not doing their job because, amongst other reasons, engineers are usually hired first (more tenured). And then the big lie begins - you don\u2019t understand what we do, stay in your lane.\nYour company dies a bit on that day.\nEventually someone again alleges someone is not doing their job, and the leader of the target employee agrees with the assessment, but they\u2019re not gonna let someone who\u2019s never been in their shoes tell them how to run their team. So they drag their feet and nobody does anything about it.\nYour company dies a bit more on that day.\nMeanwhile, the leaders you\u2019ve hired are trying not to get into fights while ramping up, and your CEO is trying to avoid criticism that they don\u2019t know how to hire executives or manage different kinds of employees. Everyone is trying to avoid being accused of being a fraud; they don\u2019t cast judgement on others to avoid getting judged themselves.\nFinally, you get to a place where there\u2019s enough mediocrity that the few truth tellers left start to get punished because they\u2019re the only ones who won\u2019t pretend that standards have fallen.\nAs then your company is officially dead.\nYou\u2019ll make it until the last of the good tenured leaders stick around to keep the boats afloat. Eventually the whole company will be mediocre and a company that throws underperformers off the island will invade and take your land.\n## A Different Way\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. In fact, with the right guidance you can encourage your team to judge their coworkers\u2019 abilities, learn from it, and have it be part of a healthy ecosystem of accountability and growth.\nHere\u2019s how to do it.\n### Ground Rules\nFirst, things fail when people start attacking others directly and publicly. People can disagree in meetings, but people should not be making judgements on their teammates in public. Performance is public, performance management is private. Make it clear to your team that any and all feedback shared on a coworker\u2019s ability is shared either in a private conversation between a person and their own manager, or in the peer feedback section of a performance review.\nSecond, follow-ups are done privately. There is never the expectation that people are privy to the details of some else\u2019s performance management. That said, if a peer\u2019s performance is causing significant issues for an individual, team, or the business, it may be appropriate to talk about how to work around those issues while performance management is happening.\nFinally, you must make clear that nobody is promised a perfect coworker. All teammates are imperfect, and the average action is not termination but coaching. One of the teachable moments in a discussion about peer performance is making clear that people are expected to succeed despite imperfect coworkers; imperfect coworker performance is a reality, not an excuse.\n### How To Do It\nOK, here\u2019s how to productively encourage your team to think about evaluating their coworkers\u2019 performance.\nFirst of all, you should set an expectation that your reports actually have an opinion on their peers\u2019 performance. Sometime in the first few months you should say out loud something like: `We strongly value peer feedback and the ability to understand and evaluate peer performance. As we work together, I\u2019ll periodically ask you how your peers are doing and I\u2019d like you to be able to have thoughtful conversations about it.`\nFurthermore, if they\u2019re in a leadership position, you might add something like: `It\u2019s quite important that you have a mature opinion on how your cross-functional partners are doing. Please make sure that you\u2019re thinking about the different roles and responsibilities you share, how they are performing, and where you see opportunities for improvement.`\nNext, you should periodically ask your report (e.g. once every 6-12 months) how they think their peers are doing. This is now when the productive conversation starts.\nIf they think someone is doing well, why? This is a teachable moment - what do you think good performance looks like? Through this exercise you can help people understand:\n  * The difference between superhuman performance and expectations (people often glamourize or mythify people just doing a really good job)\n  * The ingredients of certain people\u2019s success. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as highlighting that a strong performer works really hard.\n  * The differences in leveling and experience. That person is doing a solid job, but they\u2019re three levels above you and a lot of what they do is quite expected in role.\n\n\nIf they think someone is doing poorly, why? Again, this is a very teachable moment. It\u2019s a critical opportunity for you to be aware of underperformance, the perception of underperformance, or a misunderstanding. This is often a great opportunity to help people understand:\n  * What the role of a person actually is. Many times critical perceptions are driven by a misunderstanding of what someone is actually supposed to do. No, actually, your PM is not your project manager.\n  * The differences in leveling and experience. Sometimes people think someone isn\u2019t good at their job, but they forget that they are 4 levels beneath them in the ladder.\n\n\nThese conversations are also a very important way to get real time updates on the performance of teammates. Getting significant critical feedback from many people about a specific person is almost always a signal of underperformance. Getting this feedback in a continuous fashion is quite valuable, as many companies leave it to very infrequent performance review cycles to solicit that signal.\nFinally, an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of a peer lets people supplement their work more effectively. OK, Bob isn\u2019t great at meeting follow-ups. His manager can work on that for him, but can you, as someone who is great at it, help the team not fail when something is missed?\n## Closing Thoughts\nAll of this boils down to not letting tension relief run your company.\nWhen people work together and things fail, it\u2019s somebody\u2019s fault. One of the most evil things a company can do to people is not hold people accountable. I\u2019ve felt bad for people who have had mean bosses, but I feel terrible for people with overly protective bosses. I\u2019ve seen people literally ruin their career because they spent years under a manager who didn\u2019t have the guts to give them feedback, even when other teams were complaining.\nEspecially for leaders, not knowing how to evaluate the performance of your peer leaders is a major miss. If you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re supposed to do, how can you make sure you\u2019re working together to create a business outcome? How can you improve processes across your vocational boundaries if you don\u2019t even know what their job is? This is why it\u2019s important that all leaders have some sense of how the business fundamentally works. This is why telling people to stay in their lane is so messed up - the minute you tell someone they couldn\u2019t possibly know what they\u2019re talking about when it comes to other vocations, they can never be held accountable to end to end business value again.\nAnd for junior hires, how can they learn without knowing what good looks like? How can you learn what good looks like without ever having the ability to point to someone and talk about their performance?\nJudge your coworkers, lest you not be judged, because to not be judged is to never learn.\n## Assorted Notes\n  * Holding people accountable doesn\u2019t always mean severe punishment. In fact it almost never means severe punishment. At a small scale, it simply means having clarity on who actually owned a thing that didn\u2019t go well. At a large enough scale, it should mean some action is taken, and that action should be referenced in performance reviews. A lot of the industry moved too far into blameless culture in the last decade. A lot of stuff is someone\u2019s fault, and it\u2019s ok to say it.\n  * It really is inexcusable for a senior leader to not have a point of view on a peer\u2019s performance. Senior leaders should be knowledgeable enough to evaluate and heavily incentivized to care how their peers are doing. Apathy from a leader about peer performance is smoke that one or both of those is not true of the leader you\u2019re evaluating.\n  * One of the biggest opportunities of letting people judge their peers is coaching them when they\u2019re wrong in that assessment because they don\u2019t understand the person\u2019s role. Very few people have intuition about other roles and responsibilities, and almost no companies are going to make explicit time to teach you about them. These conversations can be one of the only places to learn what other people are supposed to be doing.\n\n\n_Share to , ,_\nsaas business technology\n## Recent Posts\n  * ###  This Is How You're Eroding Accountability 29 Jan 2025\n  * ###  Management Mantras 24 Jan 2025\n  * ###  Bottleneck Dirty Webs 06 Jan 2025\n\n\nFor new content, follow us at or subscribe via email.", "title": "Encouraging private peer performance evaluations and cross-functional accountability prevents organizational decay, as demonstrated by startups stifling feedback leading to mediocrity.", "summary": "Companies often inadvertently hinder collaboration by discouraging employees from judging their coworkers' performance.

From day one, it was a challenge. He hesitated. He first tried to avoid HR, sidestep PIPs, and hoped things would somehow work themselves out. And honestly? I get it. When you\u2019re managing people, it\u2019s impossible not to think about their families, their lives, and what this job means to them. You don\u2019t want to be the bad guy.\nBut here\u2019s the hard truth: leadership isn\u2019t about being liked. It\u2019s about making the right calls. It\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for the business while being as empathetic as possible. Sometimes, that means having difficult conversations. Sometimes, that means putting someone on a PIP. And sometimes, it means making decisions that no one wants to make. Avoiding it doesn\u2019t help anyone.\nSo, we talked. I walked him through the process. I gave my opinions about how to document concerns, when to loop in HR, and most importantly, how to set clear expectations. PIP shouldn\u2019t be just a signal that someone\u2019s on their way out. You can use PIP as a structured opportunity for improvement. If done right, it can be the turning point that helps an employee step up. At the very least, PIP ensures fairness in the process.\nPIPS have a bad reputation as if they\u2019re just a waiting room for termination. In reality, they\u2019re both a last chance for employees to turn things around and a safety net for the company. For managers, navigating a PIP requires hard work, solid process, emotional resilience, and fairness. And as a leader, it\u2019s your job to make that call when the time comes.\n## The Hard Truth About PIPs\nMost managers want to see their people grow. You invest time, coach them, give them chances and hope that people improve. That\u2019s when things get tough. At some point, a structured intervention like a PIP becomes a necessity. You want to be fair and do what\u2019s best for the business. Here\u2019s what makes PIPs so damn difficult:\n### Delaying the inevitable\nHope is a hell of a drug. Many managers put off PIPs, thinking maybe just one more conversation will fix things. But the longer you wait, the worse it gets. High performers start resenting the double standard. All of a sudden,it\u2019s not just one underperformer dragging the team down but it becomes a whole culture issue.\n### The emotional drain\nYou\u2019ve spent months, maybe years, trying to help this person. It\u2019s frustrating when they don\u2019t or in many cases won\u2019t step up. Nevertheless, a leader provides clarity and sets expectations. You can care about people while still making the tough calls.\n### Toxic fallout\nNot everyone handles a PIP professionally. Some disengage. Others spread negativity. And if you\u2019re not careful, that negativity infects the team. Your job requires both fixing underperformance and protecting your team from it. Be mindful about it. I have seen cases where the underperformer spreads bad news and gossip. \n### HR and legal landmines\nUnfortunately, A PIP isn\u2019t just a \u201cHey, you need to improve\u201d conversation. You need a structured process with documentation, fairness, and legal considerations. That\u2019s why you need your HR partner. They need to make sure you are doing and following the process right.\nRemember PIP is about clarity. It\u2019s about giving someone one last shot while ensuring fairness for the team and the business. And as a leader, it\u2019s your job to make that call, no matter how uncomfortable it gets.\n## When to Initiate a PIP\nDeciding when to put someone on a PIP is never easy, but at some point, you have to stop second-guessing and make the call. I\u2019ve found that the decision becomes clearer when you have solid indicators. If you\u2019re stuck wondering \u201cShould I?\u201d, here\u2019s what I look for:\n  * **The same performance issues keep coming up, despite clear feedback.** I once had an employee who kept missing deadlines. We talked about it. I laid out expectations. I even helped them break down their tasks. Yet every time, the same thing happened: excuses, apologies, and another missed deadline. At some point, you have to stop hoping and start holding people accountable.\n  * **They say the right things but don\u2019t take action.** You know the type. They nod during feedback conversations, agree to improve, and then\u2026 nothing changes. Maybe they\u2019ll put in extra effort for a week or two, but then they\u2019re right back to square one. If someone isn\u2019t taking ownership, no amount of coaching will fix that.\n  * **You\u2019ve already made accommodations, and they still can\u2019t meet expectations.** Lowering the bar isn\u2019t the answer. If you\u2019ve given them extra time, training, or adjusted their workload, and they still can\u2019t perform, the problem isn\u2019t the circumstances. Unfortunately, it\u2019s them. Keeping them around just drags the whole team down.\n  * **They\u2019re affecting the team in a negative way.** Performance issues are one thing, but attitude problems are a whole different beast. Maybe they complain constantly, blame others, or bring a bad vibe into meetings. If the team is frustrated, disengaged, or picking up extra slack because of one person, it\u2019s time to step in.\n  * **Their skill gap isn\u2019t closing.** Some people genuinely try but just aren\u2019t cut out for the role. And that\u2019s okay. But if months (or even years) go by and they\u2019re still struggling with fundamentals, then keeping them around isn\u2019t helping anyone, especially them.\n\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there are other factors to consider here, but you also need to be mindful of what actually warrants a PIP and what doesn\u2019t. You generally don\u2019t want to mix two different issues. Behavior is one thing, not meeting expectations is another. If someone has lied or done something unethical, that\u2019s different from missing deadlines. You shouldn\u2019t lump them together. It\u2019s best to talk with HR and let them decide what next steps are because these need to happen with company policy and jurisdiction laws. \nIf your direct report isn\u2019t responding to feedback, start documenting everything, what was said, what actions were taken, and how they responded. HR will want a clear record of the issues and the specific indicators that led to the decision.\n## Best Practices for Managing a PIP\nHere a few practices in my mind that can help you go through PIP process better or start one.\n  1. **Go to HR, engage HR early and consistently**\n     * Talk to HR early. Don\u2019t wait until a PIP is the only option.\n     * Be prepared. Understand the process and what\u2019s required.\n     * Ensure fairness. HR keeps things fair and legally sound.\n     * Use their support. They can guide both you and the employee.\n  2. **Set Clear and MeasurableGoals**\n     * Define measurable work, tie everything to metrics when you can.\n     * Talk to your employee about what success looks like.\n  3. **Maintain a Professional and Neutral Approach**\n     * You want them to make it but avoid emotional investment in the outcome.\n     * Focus on fairness so double down on performance metrics and solutions.\n  4. **Document Everything**\n     * Write down every meeting, progress update, and discussion.\n     * Share what you have recorded with your employee. Be transparent.\n     * This protects both the company and the manager in case of disputes.\n  5. **Communicate with your Team**\n     * PIP is confidential. You also need to ensure that the broader team does not suffer from the impact of an underperforming member.\n     * Set boundaries on negativity and unprofessional behavior. Intervene when needed.\n  6. **Dealing with Last-Minute Performance Spikes**\n     * Sudden improvement at the end of a PIP is common but often short-lived.\n     * You need to ensure sustained progress by requiring consistent performance beyond the PIP period.\n     * Without consistent performance, don\u2019t call it a success. \n  7. **Be Prepared for Any Outcome**\n     * Many fail to improve, be prepared.\n     * If termination is inevitable, make it happen respectfully and professionally.\n\n\n## The Manager\u2019s Growth\nI think a PIP is one of the toughest tests for a manager. It comes with a heavy burden. Preparing the document, aligning with the employee, running it, tracking progress. Oh man, it\u2019s a real hassle, but it has to be done. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. Been there, done that. But sooner or later, you\u2019ll have to do it. Here\u2019s what you take away from it:\n  * Act early. Waiting too long only makes things worse.\n  * Detach emotionally. Care about people, but don\u2019t let it cloud your judgment.\n  * Write everything down. If it\u2019s not written, it didn\u2019t happen. Rely on messages or record your feedback on 1:1 doc.\n  * A strong team requires accountability, if they don\u2019t deliver, they won\u2019t make it.\n  * Don\u2019t sugarcoat the problem, it only delays progress. I heard it so many times \u201cI didn\u2019t understand I had performance problems\u201d. Be as direct as you can.\n  * PIP has real consequences for failing it, make it very clear.\n  * Stay consistent. Nothing kills team morale faster than unfair treatment.\n\n\n## Alternative Approaches to PIPs\nPIPs have a reputation. And let\u2019s be real\u2014most people see them as a slow march to the exit. But there are other ways to handle underperformance.

To get our beautiful quarterly print edition,__._\nAt a casual glance, the recent cascades of American disasters might seem unrelated. In a span of fewer than six months in 2017, three U.S. Naval warships experienced three separate collisions resulting in 17 deaths. A year later, powerlines owned by PG&E started a wildfire that killed 85 people. The pipeline carrying almost half of the East Coast\u2019s gasoline shut down due to a ransomware attack. Almost half a million intermodal containers sat on cargo ships unable to dock at Los Angeles ports. A train carrying thousands of tons of hazardous and flammable chemicals derailed near East Palestine, Ohio. Air Traffic Control cleared a FedEx plane to land on a runway occupied by a Southwest plane preparing to take off. Eye drops contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria killed four and blinded fourteen. \nWhile disasters like these are often front-page news, the broader connection between the disasters barely elicits any mention. America must be understood as a system of interwoven systems; the healthcare system sends a bill to a patient using the postal system, and that patient uses the mobile phone system to pay the bill with a credit card issued by the banking system. All these systems must be assumed to work for anyone to make even simple decisions. But the failure of one system has cascading consequences for all of the adjacent systems. As a consequence of escalating rates of failure, America\u2019s complex systems are slowly collapsing.\nThe core issue is that changing political mores have established the systematic promotion of the unqualified and sidelining of the competent. This has continually weakened our society\u2019s ability to manage modern systems. At its inception, it represented a break from the trend of the 1920s to the 1960s, when the direct meritocratic evaluation of competence became the norm across vast swaths of American society. \nIn the first decades of the twentieth century, the idea that individuals should be systematically evaluated and selected based on their ability rather than wealth, class, or political connections, led to significant changes in selection techniques at all levels of American society. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) revolutionized college admissions by allowing elite universities to find and recruit talented students from beyond the boarding schools of New England. Following the adoption of the SAT, aptitude tests such as Wonderlic (1936), Graduate Record Examination (1936), Army General Classification Test (1941), and Law School Admission Test (1948) swept the United States. Spurred on by the demands of two world wars, this system of institutional management electrified the Tennessee Valley, created the first atom bomb, invented the transistor, and put a man on the moon. \nBy the 1960s, the systematic selection for competence came into direct conflict with the political imperatives of the civil rights movement. During the period from 1961 to 1972, a series of Supreme Court rulings, executive orders, and laws\u2014most critically, the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014put meritocracy and the new political imperative of protected-group diversity on a collision course. Administrative law judges have accepted statistically observable disparities in outcomes between groups as _prima facie_ evidence of illegal discrimination. The result has been clear: any time meritocracy and diversity come into direct conflict, diversity must take priority. \nThe resulting norms have steadily eroded institutional competency, causing America\u2019s complex systems to fail with increasing regularity. In the language of a systems theorist, by decreasing the competency of the actors within the system, formerly stable systems have begun to experience normal accidents at a rate that is faster than the system can adapt. The prognosis is harsh but clear: either selection for competence will return or America will experience devolution to more primitive forms of civilization and loss of geopolitical power.\n### **From Meritocracy to Diversity**\nThe first domino to fall as civil rights-era policies took effect was the quantitative evaluation of competency by employers using straightforward cognitive batteries. While some tests are still legally used in hiring today, several high-profile  against employers caused a wholesale change in the tools customarily usable by employers to screen for ability. \nAfter the early 1970s, employers responded by shifting from directly testing for ability to using the next best thing: a degree from a highly-selective university. By pushing the selection challenge to the college admissions offices, selective employers did two things: they reduced their risk of lawsuits and they turned the U.S. college application process into a high-stakes war of all against all. Admission to Harvard would be a golden ticket to join the professional managerial class, while mere admission to a state school could mean a struggle to remain in the middle class.\nThis outsourcing did not stave off the ideological change for long. Within the system of political imperatives now dominant in all major U.S. organizations, diversity must be prioritized even if there is a price in competency. The definition of diversity varies by industry and geography. In elite universities, diversity means black, indigenous, or Hispanic. In California, Indian women are diverse but Indian men are not. When selecting corporate board members, diversity means \u201canyone who is not a straight white man.\u201d The legally protected and politically enforced nature of this imperative renders an open dialogue nearly impossible. \nHowever diversity itself is defined, most policy on the matter is based on a simple premise: since all groups are identical in talent, any unbiased process must produce the same group proportions as the general population, and therefore, processes that produce disproportionate outcomes must be biased. Prestigious journals like _Harvard Business Review_ are the first to summarize and parrot these views, which then flow down to reporting by mass media organizations like _Bloomberg Businessweek_. Soon, it joins McKinsey\u2019s \u201cbest practices\u201d list and becomes instantiated in corporate policies. \nUnlike accounting policies, which emanate from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and are then implemented by Chief Financial Officers, the diversity push emanates inside of organizations from multiple power centers, each of which joins in for independent reasons. CEOs push diversity policies primarily to please board members and increase their status. Human Resources (HR) professionals push diversity policies primarily to avoid anti-discrimination lawsuits. Business development teams push diversity to win additional business from diversity-sensitive clients (e.g. government agencies). Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), such as the Black Googler Network, push diversity to help their in-group in hiring and promotion decisions.\n### **Diversity in Theory and Practice**\nIn police academies around the country, new recruits are taught to apply an escalation of force algorithm with non-compliant subjects: \u201cAsk, Tell, Make.\u201d The idea behind \u201cAsk, Tell, Make\u201d is to apply the least amount of force necessary to achieve the desired level of compliance. This is the means by which police power, which is ultimately backed by significant coercive force, can maintain an appearance of voluntary compliance and soft-handedness. Similarly, the power centers inside U.S. institutions apply a variant of \u201cAsk, Tell, Make\u201d to achieve diversity in their respective organizations.\nThe first tactics for implementing diversity imperatives are the \u201cAsk\u201d tactics. These simply ask all the members of the organization to end bias. At this stage, the policies seem so reasonable and fair that there will rarely be much pushback. Best practices such as  are a common tool at this stage. Slating guidelines require that every hiring process must include a certain number and type of diverse candidates for every job opening. Structured interviews are another best practice that requires interviewers to stick with a script to minimize the chance of uncovering commonalities between the interviewer and interviewee that might introduce bias. Often HR will become involved in the hiring process, specifically asking the hiring manager to defend their choice _not_ to hire a diverse candidate. Because the wrong answer could result in shaming, loss of advancement opportunities, or even termination, the hiring manager can often be persuaded to prioritize diversity over competence.\nWithin specialized professional services companies, senior-level recruiting will occasionally result in a resume collection where not a single diverse candidate meets the minimum specifications of the job. This is a terrible outcome for the hiring manager as it attracts negative attention from HR. At this point, firms will often retain an executive search agency that focuses on exclusively diverse candidates. When that does not result in sufficient diversity, roles will often have their requirements diluted to increase the pool of diverse candidates. \nFor example, within hedge funds, the ideal entry-level candidate might be an experienced former investment banker who went to a top MBA program. This preferred pedigree sets a minimum bar for both competence and work ethic. This first-pass filter enormously winnows the field of underrepresented candidates. To relax requirements for diversity\u2019s sake, this will be diluted in various ways. First, the work experience might be stripped. Next, the role gets offered to MBA interns. Finally, fresh undergraduates are hired into the analyst role. Dilution works not just because of the larger field of candidates it allows for but also because the Harvard Admission Office of 2019 is even more focused on certain kinds of diversity than the Harvard Admission Office of 2011 was. \nThis dilution is not costless; fewer data points result in a wider range of outcomes and increase the risk of a bad hire. All bad hires are costly but bad hires that are diverse are even worse. The risk of a wrongful termination lawsuit either draws out the termination process for diverse hires or results in the firm adjusting by giving them harmless busy work until they leave of their own volition\u2014either way, a terrible outcome for the organizations which hired them.\nIf these \u201cAsk\u201d tactics do not achieve enough diversity, the next step in the escalation is to attach carrots and sticks to directly tell decision-makers to increase the diversity of the organization. This is the point at which the goals of diversity and competence truly begin", "title": "America's complex systems face systemic collapse due to competence erosion from diversity mandates prioritizing inclusion over merit, exemplified by PG&E's wildfire disaster and dilution of hiring standards in corporate environments.", "summary": "America's complex systems are collapsing due to a competence crisis, where the promotion of unqualified individuals and sidelining of competent ones has weakened the country's ability to manage modern systems. This crisis stems from a shift in political mores, prioritizing diversity over meritocracy since the 1960s. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subsequent laws led to a collision between meritocracy and diversity, with diversity taking priority. As a result, institutional competency has eroded, causing frequent system failures.\n\n- Key system failures: \n\n  * 2017 US Naval warship collisions (17 deaths)\n\n  * 2018 PG&E wildfire (85 deaths)\n\n  * Ransomware attack on East Coast gasoline pipeline\n\n  * Los Angeles port cargo ship backlog\n\n  * East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment\n\n  * Air Traffic Control near-miss incident\n\n  * Contaminated eye drops (4 deaths, 14 blinded)\n\nThe prioritization of diversity has led to a decline in merit-based selection, with employers relying on degrees from selective universities rather than direct competency testing. This has created a high-stakes college admissions process, where admission to top universities is seen as a guarantee of professional success. The diversity imperative, enforced through various power centers within organizations, has resulted in the dilution of job requirements to increase diverse candidate pools, ultimately leading to costly bad hires and further eroding institutional competency.", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://phys.org/news/2025-03-saturday-citations-universe-doesnt-precious.html", "domains": ["Astrophysics", "Cosmology"], "highlights": ["The new data from the DESI collaboration indicates tensions emerging between observations of the expansion of the universe, suggesting the impact of dark energy may be weakening over time.", "Arnaud de Mattia, a French physicist, noted that when combining all cosmological data, it favors the universe's expansion accelerating at a slightly higher rate around 7 billion years ago", "The evolving dark energy theory challenges the standard cosmological model, potentially leading to scenarios like the 'big rip,' 'big crunch,' or 'big bounce' for the universe's fate."], "names": ["DESI", "Arnaud de Mattia", "Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument", "Science X Network"], "text": "by Chris Packham , Phys.org \nThis week, ALMA researchers reported the discovery of oxygen in the most distant known galaxy. Geologists believe unusual structures in rock in the desert regions of Namibia, Oman and Saudia Arabia may be evidence of an unknown microorganism. And a group of physicists may have generated a tiny charge of electricity using the Earth's rotational energy. But the biggest story by far is the second release of data from the DESI survey of the universe, which could upend the standard model:\n## DESI is coming for the standard model\nAn emerging generation of cosmological surveys launched this week with the second release of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, which is mapping an unprecedentedly huge number of galaxies spanning 11 billion years of cosmic history in order to better understand dark energy.\nAstronomers have known for many decades that the universe is expanding; in the 1990s, the first image of the cosmic microwave background\u2014the echo of the big bang\u2014revealed that this expansion is accelerating for unknown reasons. Astronomers call this expansion \"dark energy,\" which translates to \"we don't understand what this energy is.\"\nThe new data from the DESI collaboration, much of which comprises refinement of the first data release, indicates tensions emerging between observations of the expansion of the universe. When the collaboration combined the new data with previous observations, they found signs that the impact of dark energy on universal expansion may be weakening over time.\n\"When we combine all the cosmological data, it favors that the universe's expansion was accelerating at a slightly higher rate around 7 billion years ago,\" said Arnaud de Mattia, a French physicist on the team analyzing the data. However, the researchers emphasize that they do not have absolute certainty for this yet\u2014meaning the research effort has not yet met the \"five sigma\" statistical threshold physicists use as a marker for certainty.\nThis new theory of \"evolving dark energy\" will impact the standard cosmological model, which will require substantial changes to incorporate new findings.\n## OK, but let's speculate\nSo let's say this result\u2014that dark energy evolves over time\u2014is confirmed by DESI and the forthcoming next-gen surveys later in the decade. Right now, the standard model suggests expansion until the ultimate heat death of the universe. But now, we can consider more exciting, cinematic possibilities for the fate of the universe: if the universal expansion acceleration increases over time, the universe could tear apart in a \"big rip.\" Alternatively, it could reach a point of maximum expansion and collapse inward in a \"big crunch.\"\nIn the \"big rip\" scenario, as the acceleration of universal expansion increases toward infinity within a finite time, all matter down to the scale of atoms and subatomic particles, and spacetime itself, are (as the best dungeon masters put it) \"torn asunder.\"\nAs the universe approaches this point, galaxies would become gravitationally unbound as matter dispersed; ultimately, the same thing would happen to planetary systems; then military squadrons, families and married couples. Then atoms would become ionized as their electrons were ripped away. Finally, atomic nuclei themselves would disassociate.\nBy contrast, in the \"big crunch,\" the expansion of the universe reverses and all matter and spacetime reconverge toward a singularity, or at least toward a singular point. If the universe contains a high enough density of matter, gravity would stop universal expansion and all matter would fall back in on itself.\nThis leads to a third theory, the \"big bounce,\" which suggests that the universe itself is a cycle of expansions, collapses and re-expansions. At the smallest point of convergence, general relativity demands the emergence of a singularity.\nHowever, physicists theorize that quantum effects become highly important at that stage, preventing the formation of a singularity and instead resulting in a highly energetic and explosive expansion (and the birth of a new universe). This theory is currently so far away from the \"five sigma\" threshold as to effectively exist in another universe, but it is indisputably the prettiest of the theories of the nature of the universe.\n.\n\u00a9 2025 Science X Network \n**Citation** : Saturday Citations: The universe doesn't care about your precious standard model (2025, March 22) retrieved 24 March 2025 from https://phys.org/news/2025-03-saturday-citations-universe-doesnt-precious.html \nThis document is subject to copyright.

It won\u2019t be much.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWith markets tumbling and the S&P 500 erasing the gains it made since Trump\u2019s election in November, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, argued earlier Tuesday that this week\u2019s tariffs are just a bump in the road. The administration has now slapped 25% duties on imports from Mexico and most imports from Canada, along with 20% levies on Chinese goods.\n\u201cWall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers,\u201d Bessent on Fox News, when asked about the markets\u2019 downward spiral.\nBut trade groups, , and experts say the tariffs won\u2019t just hurt Wall Street bankers. \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce tariffs will only \u201cincrease the economic pain\u201d being felt by Americans, warning that some companies it represents could be forced out of business.

A handful, such as Chipotle, have said they will attempt to absorb the entirety of the costs to keep prices manageable for consumers. But that\u2019s not sustainable for many companies in the long run \u2014 especially if more tariffs are issued. \nVehicles from major automakers such as General Motors and Ford Motor Co. could cost between $4,000 and $10,000 more for gas-powered models, or as much as $12,000 more for an electric vehicle with parts from Mexico and Canada. Profit margins of the Detroit Three automakers will be wiped out without price hikes, .\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s claims that farmers \u201care going to have a field day right now,\u201d they\u2019re also set to be hurt by his trade war. Produce, including avocados and strawberries, is set to become more expensive because of the duties on Mexico. \nAdvertisement\nChina, which the Department of Agriculture to be the third-largest market for U.S. agricultural products, has issued tariffs on goods including chicken, soybeans, and corn.

The top 1% of households would be impacted the least, while the poorest Americans were expected to be the hardest hit.\n\u201cThe reality of it is poor people or less highly paid people consume 100% of their paychecks,\u201d , Trump\u2019s former chief economic advisor, said at the Bloomberg Invest conference on Tuesday. \u201cWealthier people consume a very small percentage of their paychecks. The things that are being tariffed are things everyday people buy.\u201d\nThe longer the tariffs are active, the greater the impact they will have on companies and economies. The president is also moving to issue more tariffs, which will exacerbate their effects. \nTrump has teased duties on foreign aluminum, steel, copper, cars, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, timber, lumber, and agricultural products. He\u2019s also discussed hitting the European Union with 25% tariffs and issuing so-called reciprocal tariffs.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough the official reasoning from the White House is that this first round of tariffs \u2014 the duties on Canada, Mexico, and China \u2014 is to force action against fentanyl smuggling, Trump is also using trade policy to convince companies to make products in the U.S. For many companies, that would likely be a years-long effort.\n\u201cJust because a [politician] decides that you need to [reorganize] your supply chains, and even if they offer money, it actually is much harder than everyone thinks it is,\u201d said , the secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt\u2019s taken years to develop those valuable supply chains and the interconnectedness. ...

No natural enzymes produce this type of polymer, so researchers tweaked enzyme-encoding genes from various bacteria and inserted them into _Escherichia coli_ to make the bioplastic, called poly(ester amide), or PEA. There are many hurdles to overcome before this laboratory experiment can be translated into a product: the PEA polymers have to be purified before they can be used, and the process is currently more expensive than the fossil-fuel route.\nNature | 4 min read\nReference: \n## **Catchy, concise and better-cited**\nUsing catchy, three-part phrases in the titles of research papers can boost their citations.

Popular browser provider Opera has joined in to offer a tool that will actively do tasks on the web for you. If this catches on, the way we interact with the internet might never be the same, especially if it's baked right into the browser like Opera's is.\nThe idea for the Operator is that, instead of just answering questions or giving you information like Opera's Aria AI assistant, it can go out onto the web and do things on your behalf. You can tell it to buy concert tickets, book a hotel, track down the best deals on a gadget, or research a topic, and it will navigate sites, fill out forms, and complete tasks for you while keeping you updated.\nYou\u2019re still in control, but now you have a digital errand runner handling the tedious stuff. And that could change a lot about how we use the internet. Here are five ways it could shake things up.\n## Shop for me\n(Image credit: Opera)\nOnline shopping could become radically simpler with Opera's Operator. Right now, finding the perfect item can require having ten tabs full of reviews, price comparisons, and shipping data. With the Browser Operator, you could just say, \u201cFind me the best-rated wireless earbuds under $150 and order them to my address.\u201d\nInstead of doom-scrolling product pages for an hour, you\u2019d get a curated recommendation, approve it, and be done in seconds. Imagine never dealing with sketchy third-party sellers again because your AI assistant already weeded them out for you.\n## Trip AI\nThe Operator could make planning travel actually fun instead of stressful. A simple weekend trip requires juggling flight options, hotel rates, rental car bookings, and activity reservations, all while praying you don\u2019t accidentally book a 10-hour layover.\nWith the Browser Operator, you could say, \u201cPlan a weekend getaway to Chicago with a hotel near downtown and a rental car,\u201d and it would handle the legwork, presenting you with an itinerary to approve. No more agonizing over which travel site has the best deals or whether that budget hotel actually has walls. The AI would be able to do the tedious searching; you just decide what sounds good.\n## Subscribe AI\nManaging subscriptions and online accounts could stop being a nightmare using AI. These days, half of our digital lives are spent trying to remember where we signed up for what, why we\u2019re still being charged for something we don\u2019t use, and how to cancel a subscription before it renews for another year. Normally, you have to dig through emails, track down obscure account settings, and fight a desperate battle with \u201cAre you sure you want to cancel?\u201d pop-ups.\nWith the Browser Operator, you could say, \u201cFind all my active subscriptions and show me what I should cancel.\u201d It could even handle the cancellations for you, sparing you from guilt-tripping retention prompts. Suddenly, your bank account isn\u2019t a graveyard of forgotten free trials turned full-priced commitments.\n## Bills to pay\n(Image credit: Opera)\nEven the most mundane online tasks could become hands-free with the Operator's help. Paying bills, managing subscriptions, downloading bank statements are all the little things that chip away at your day. The annoyance of having to remember which day you need to log in, navigate a website, and remember your passwords is just part of life.\nHowever, you can set up the Browser Operator to handle routine tasks automatically. Imagine just getting a notification that your phone bill has been paid instead of remembering to do it yourself. That\u2019s not just convenience but fewer minor annoyances cluttering your brain.\n## Information filter\nKeeping up with the internet\u2019s relentless firehose of content might actually become manageable using the AI Operator. Staying informed today means subscribing to newsletters, following a bunch of blogs, and hoping the algorithm decides to show you nothing but cat videos. But the Browser Operator could act as your own personal news curator.\nYou could tell it, \u201cKeep me updated on the latest breakthroughs in space exploration,\u201d and it would regularly collect and summarize the most relevant articles. Instead of wading through an endless news feed, you\u2019d get just what matters to you, neatly packaged. That way, you can stay informed without feeling like the internet\u2019s infinite scroll has hijacked your entire day.\n## Operator opening\nThe internet has always required us to be the operators; clicking, searching, navigating, managing. But with AI tools like this, that might be changing. Opera\u2019s Browser Operator takes the first real step toward making the browser an active participant instead of a passive tool. It doesn\u2019t just give you a new way to browse; it changes what browsing is. Sure, this could make everything more efficient, but it also raises questions about what happens when we offload so much of our online activity to AI. If the internet can browse itself for us, how much do we really need to engage with it? Will we still know how to search for things manually in a few years, or will that start to feel as outdated as dialing a rotary phone?\nFor now, though, it\u2019s hard not to be excited. This is the kind of innovation that makes you wonder how we ever lived without it. If AI can start handling the tedious parts of the internet, maybe we\u2019ll finally have time for the things we actually enjoy. Or, more realistically, maybe we\u2019ll just use that extra time to doom-scroll even more efficiently. Either way, the future of browsing just got a lot more interesting.\n### You might also like\n  * OpenAI's first AI Agent is here, and Operator can make a dinner reservation and complete other tasks on the web for you\n  * I discovered a surprising difference between DeepSeek and ChatGPT search capabilities\n  * Opera brings its web browser and AI assistant to iOS", "title": "Opera's Browser Operator AI transforms web browsing by autonomously executing tasks like shopping, travel planning, and subscription management, reshaping user interaction with the internet.", "summary": "Opera's new AI agent web browser, Operator, can perform tasks on the web for users, potentially changing how we interact with the internet.

He was arrested after Trump's speech Tuesday night, when Johnson presided over the House floor and sat just behind the president's left shoulder.\n\u201cA driver backed into a parked vehicle last night around 11:40 p.m.,\" U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. \"We responded and arrested them for DUI.\u201d\n### Recommended\n### CongressHouse votes to censure Rep.

He has been chief of staff in the speaker's office since Johnson won the top job in the House in October 2023. Before that, Haynes was chief of staff to Johnson in his personal office from 2017 to 2023. He also worked in various roles for former Sen. David Vitter, another Louisiana Republican, from 2009 to 2016.\nAsked Wednesday by NBC News whether Johnson was standing by Haynes, he said, \"I am. I am.\" \nJohnson spokesperson Taylor Haulsee said in a statement: \u201cThe Speaker is aware of the encounter that occurred last night involving his Chief of Staff and the Capitol Police. The Speaker has known and worked closely with Hayden for nearly a decade and trusted him to serve as his Chief of Staff for his entire tenure in Congress. Because of this and Hayden\u2019s esteemed reputation among Members and staff alike, the Speaker has full faith and confidence in Hayden\u2019s ability to lead the Speaker\u2019s office.\u201d\nWhile most crimes in Washington are prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, DUI offenses are prosecuted by the D.C. Office of the Attorney General, an office headed by D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb. \nThe distinction could be meaningful, because the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, is a conservative activist with ties to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Martin, whom Trump wants to be the city's chief federal prosecutor on a permanent basis, was granted access to Capitol Police video from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, which Martin used to spread conspiracy theories about the attack. Schwalb's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nLast month, Washington police sent an arrest warrant for Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., but Martin's office did not sign off on it. Mills had been investigated over allegations of an assault in an apartment building, and he said police had helped \"resolve a private matter.\" \nTed Oberg\nTed Oberg is an investigative reporter at NBC4 Washington.\nRyan J.

I must mention here that I do not have synaesthesia. Many of these connections were shaped by childhood experiences. Notably, two unrelated influences, learning about computers and studying mnemonic systems, have played a significant role in forming these associations. \n## Contents\n  * Association Table\n  * IBM CGA Colours\n  * Phonetic Number System\n  * Colourful Words\n  * Colourful Examples\n  * Story Time\n  * Conclusion\n\n\n## Association Table\nThe following table presents a quick summary of these associations. \nNumber | Colour | Sound  \n---|---|---  \n0 | Black |  /s/, /z/  \n1 | Blue |  /t/, /d/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/  \n2 | Green |  /n/, /\u014b/  \n3 | Cyan | /m/  \n4 | Red | /r/  \n5 | Magenta | /l/  \n6 | Brown |  /t\u0283/, /d\u0292/, /\u0283/, /\u0292/  \n7 | White |  /k/, /g/  \n8 | Gray |  /f/, /v/  \n9 | Light Blue |  /p/, /b/  \n0xA | Light Green | -  \n0xB | Light Cyan | -  \n0xC | Light Red | -  \n0xD | Light Magenta | -  \n0xE | Yellow | -  \n0xF | Bright White | -  \nI should clarify here that the associations for the hexadecimal numbers 0xA to 0xF are rather weak in my mind. I rarely ever have a need to think about them in my day-to-day life these days. But the associations for the numbers 0 to 9 remain fairly intact. \n## IBM CGA Colours\nThe number-colour associations in the assocation table come from my early exposure to GWBASIC running on IBM machines with Colour Graphics Adapter (CGA) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA). On these systems, each supported colour was represented by an integer code: 0 for black, 1 for blue, 2 for green, and so on. \nOn IBM CGA machines set to video mode 3, each colour was encoded as a 4-bit number. From the most significant bit to the least significant one, the bits represented intensity, red, green, and blue (IRGB). For example, the number 1 (binary 0001) represented blue whereas 9 (binary 1001) represented light blue. Further, CGA monitors had special circuits to treat colour 6 differently. Normally, the number 6 (binary 0110) would represent yellow since the red and green signals are turned on. However, the special circuit of CGA monitors reduced the amplitude of the green signal to make the output look brown instead of yellow. \nThe EGA machines supported a total of 64 colours but only a maximum of 16 colours could be used at a time. These 16 colours formed a customisable palette. The default palette was backward compatible with CGA. \nPrograms that wrote text directly to video memory at address B800:0000 also used these integer codes to display text in different colours. \nI still fondly remember the excitement of using colour commands to paint the background blue and write text on it with various colours. That early experience left me with a preference for certain numbers corresponding to certain colours. Because of this, I find it a bit disconcerting that ANSI control sequences, in a way, use the least significant bit to represent red rather than blue. \nIn ANSI control sequences for select graphic rendition (SGR), the paremeter value 31 is red, 32 is green, 33 is yellow, 34 is blue, and so on. I find this reversal of the order of colours a little unsettling. \n## Phonetic Number System\nThe number-sound associations in the association table come from a phonetic mnemonic system I learnt as a kid. I first discovered this system in a book on memory techniques by Harry Lorayne, which I borrowed from a friend. This mnemonic system assigns a specific set of consonant sounds to each number. The vowel sounds play no role in this system. \nAs we can see in the table, the sounds /s/ and /z/ are assigned to the number 0, the sounds /t/, /d/, /\u03b8/, and /\u00f0/ are assigned to the number 1, /n/ and /\u014b/ are assigned to 2, /m/ to 3, /r/ to 4, /l/ to 5, /t\u0283/, /d\u0292/, /\u0283/, and /\u0292/ are all assigned to 6, /k/ and /g/ are assigned to 7, /f/ and /v/ to 8, and finally, /p/ and /b/ to 9. \nThere is also a meta-mnemonic system that provides some visual cues to remember these assignments. I'll briefly describe it here. The letter \"`z`\" is the first letter of \"zero\" (0). Typewritten \"`t`\" has one downstroke (1), while \"`n`\" has two (2), and \"`m`\" has three (3). The letter \"`r`\" is the last letter of \"four\" (4). \"`L`\" is the roman numeral for 50. Typewritten \"`g`\" when turned around looks like 6. \"`K`\" can be imagined as two 7s lying next to each other, with the top one flipped. A cursive \"`f`\" has two loops, just like the shape of 8. Flipping \"`P`\" horizontally makes it look like 9. \nThis meta-mnemonic system is a helpful aid when first learning the phonetic number system, but with practice, it becomes redundant. From here on, I will not discuss it any further and will focus solely on the phonetic number system itself. \nSince there is a set of consonant sounds assigned to each number, this system allows us to translate words and sentences to numbers and vice versa quite easily. For example, the word \"train\" becomes the number 142. The number 3402 may be translated to the words \"more sun\" or \"mario zone\" or whatever else comes to your mind for the sounds /m/, /r/, /s/ or /z/, and /n/ or /\u014b/. \nAlthough the primary purpose of this mnemonic system is to translate numbers to memorable words and then later recall the numbers by reversing the process, frequent use of this technique in my childhood days had an unintended side effect. My mind now instinctively translates arbitrary words into numbers. While this effect has weakened with age, it still lingers, especially when I read signboards, product labels, street names, etc. The reverse effect remains as well. For example, if I look at bus route numbers, flight numbers, dates, etc. my mind automatically converts them to matching words. \n## Colourful Words\nAlthough there is no direct mapping between colours and sounds, they can be linked indirectly. Each consonant sound is associated with a digit and each digit is associated with a colour. As a result, each consonant sound is indirectly associated with a colour. For example, the word \"planet\" can be translated to 9521. The colours associated with this number are light blue, magenta, green, and blue, respectively. The word \"planet\" is thus visualised as 9521 or PLANET. \nMy name \"Susam\" becomes 003 or SUSAM. It is mostly black and a little bit of cyan. Apparently, my name is not too colourful. \nAs another example, the word \"hydrogen\" is visualised as the number 1462 or the coloured word HYDROGEN. The colours here are blue, red, brown, and green. \nSimilarly, the word \"computer\" is visualised as the number 7391 or the coloured word COMPUTER. The colours here are white, cyan, light blue, and blue. In case you're wondering why the final \"r\" is not visualised, that's because I do not always pronounce it. \n## Colourful Examples\nThe list below presents some more examples of words, numbers, and their colours: \nAPPLE\n95\nBLUE\n95\nCAT\n71\nDIGIT\n161\nNote that the \"pp\" in \"apple\" is pronounced as /p/, which corresponds to a single number 9. That's why \"apple\" is translated to 95 (not 995). There is also a certain harmony in the second example. The word \"blue\" begins with a blue colour! \nENOUGH\n28\nFUNCTION\n82762\nGREEN\n742\nHOME\n3\nThe \"gh\" in \"enough\" is pronounced /f/, so it is assigned the number 8. Likewise, the \"ti\" in \"function\" produces the sound /\u0283/, which corresponds to the number 6. \nICE\n0\nJUNE\n62\nKNOWLEDGE\n256\nLONDON\n5212\nThe \"c\" of \"ice\" is pronounced /s/, so it is assigned the number 0. It is interesting how a long word like \"knowledge\" yields a small number like 256. \nMATHEMATICS\n313170\nNUMBER\n239\nOXYGEN\n7062\nPARADOX\n94170\nThe \"th\" in \"mathematics\" produces the sound /\u03b8/, which corresponds to the number 1. The word \"number\" has the number 239.

But the Republican Party has.\nBy Radley Balko, investigative journalist\nShortly after the video of George Floyd\u2019s death went viral in May 2020, a popular conservative pundit in which he decried Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for kneeling on Floyd for \u201cfour straight minutes,\u201d even though Floyd, bystanders and even other police officers told Chauvin that Floyd couldn\u2019t breathe. \nThis pundit pointed to video of the incident to dismiss the argument that Floyd was resisting arrest. It\u2019s \u201creally ugly and really bad,\u201d he said, adding that Chauvin should be prosecuted \u201cto the fullest extent of the law\u201d and should \u201cgo to jail\u201d and that \u201ceveryone should be on the same side of this.\u201d Several days later, the same pundit that Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of Chauvin and other Minneapolis police officers should inspire Americans to \u201crally\u201d against such \u201cobvious evil.\u201d\nThat pundit was the Daily Wire\u2019s Ben Shapiro. This week, to pardon Chauvin on the federal charges he faced for causing Floyd\u2019s death.\nEven as he condemned Chauvin\u2019s brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters.\nAs you might have guessed, I\u2019ve left out some important context to Shapiro\u2019s 2020 condemnation of Chauvin\u2019s brutality. The problem is that the context doesn\u2019t help \u2014 it makes it all a lot worse. Even as he condemned Chauvin\u2019s brutality, Shapiro also scolded activists, racial justice advocates and protesters for claiming that what Chauvin did was commonplace or racially motivated. He chastised critics who argued that police brutality is systemic. George Floyd\u2019s killer _would_ be prosecuted, Shapiro promised, and that would prove the system works. \nShapiro seemed particularly offended at the very idea that other police officers or conservatives like him would defend Chauvin. _Everyone_ condemned Chauvin\u2019s actions, he assured us \u2014 from him to police groups around the country to President Donald Trump. The mere fact that so many people on the right had condemned a white cop for killing a Black man was, he argued, _in and of_ _itself_ proof that systemic racism is a myth. \nWhat a difference five years makes. Now Shapiro claims that Chauvin\u2019s trial was a farce and that his \u201cconviction represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive, and racist era without righting this terrible wrong.\u201d Other and , but Shapiro\u2019s plea achieved particular significance after it was , Trump\u2019s unofficial co-president and his largest campaign donor.\nThat conservative pundits like Shapiro now defend Chauvin isn\u2019t surprising. It follows a familiar pattern after high-profile incidents of police brutality spark large protests. Those protests are rarely only about the precipitating incident itself. They tend to happen in places with long-established police abuse and racism. And as , there was plenty of both at the Minneapolis Police Department.\nThe campaign to retroactively exonerate Chauvin and reverse the progress made by George Floyd protests produced and co-written by a former TV host . It was then distributed by a far-right advocacy group that poses as a news organization. Among other risible claims, the documentary accuses the FBI of pressuring Minneapolis officials to manufacture evidence to implicate Chauvin. You know the FBI. Always looking for reasons to smear cops.\nNevertheless, the documentary slowly gained purchase in online right-wing culture, first with MAGA influencers on social media, then with far-right personalities like Megan Kelly and Tucker Carlson and finally with . \nAs with most lies perpetuated by the far right, the truth is there for those who want it. In a , I documented in detail how its producers duped gullible pundits and columnists into amplifying claims that were false, misleading or wholly made-up. But as is also the case with far-right mythology, the true believers aren\u2019t interested in reality. They want validation. So the \u201cdocumentary\u201d is now MAGA canon.\nShapiro\u2019s demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It\u2019s purely symbolic.\nThe video depicting George Floyd\u2019s murder hasn\u2019t changed in five years. It\u2019s as harrowing as ever. Bystanders, other police officers and Floyd himself plead with Chauvin. They tell him Floyd isn\u2019t breathing. They cry out to Chauvin that Floyd doesn\u2019t have a pulse. Chauvin callously ignores them. And George Floyd dies.\nWhat has changed is the right\u2019s posture toward racism and political violence. The gutter politics of people like Laura Loomer, Marjorie Taylor-Greene and Nick Fuentes is now part of the Republican Party\u2019s core. People who were too racist for the first Trump administration have been in the second. It\u2019s now acceptable to tell vicious lies about immigrant groups like the to . Pizzagate propagator Jack Posobiec now advises Trump Cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and . The sitting vice president wrote the foreword to Posobiec\u2019s book \u2014 a book in which, right in the title, Posobiec declares his political enemies\nDonald Trump has always valorized political violence. He has spent the last decade dehumanizing immigrants, defending police brutality, celebrating the violent suppression of dissent about the waiting to spill blood on his behalf should he ever need them (). \nThe political right has now fully embraced that ethos. When Kyle Rittenhouse lugged his guns into a volatile protest zone and killed two people, those deaths were treated not as tragic but as legally justified. They. A year after Daniel Perry was convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pardoned him at the urging of right-wing voices like Tucker Carlson. And when, in one of Trump\u2019s first acts after his inauguration, he granted clemency to the Jan. 6 rioters, including those who violently attacked Capitol Police officers, those on the right praised the pardons and commutations.\nShapiro himself acknowledges that Trump can pardon Chauvin only on the federal charges of violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights. The more serious charges came in state court, where Trump has no clemency power.\nThis means Shapiro\u2019s demand has nothing to do with the alleged injustice done to Chauvin. It\u2019s purely symbolic: Shapiro wants validation for his argument that Chauvin was wrongly convicted. He wants the president to refute the notion that Shapiro himself advanced in 2020: that Chauvin\u2019s treatment of George Floyd was \u201creally ugly and really bad\u201d and \u201cobviously evil.\u201d\nWhen we contrast the two Ben Shapiros, five years apart, the right\u2019s grim trajectory over that time comes into focus. The 2020 Ben Shapiro argued that the right\u2019s near-universal condemnation of Chauvin was proof that his side takes police brutality seriously, that its support for the prosecution of a white cop for killing an unarmed Black man was proof that it isn\u2019t racist and that Chauvin\u2019s inevitable prosecution was proof of its belief that the criminal justice system is fair and just. The 2025 Ben Shapiro \u2014 along with much of the right \u2014 now says that Chauvin\u2019s killing of Floyd was justified, that his prosecution should never have happened and that his conviction was political and vindictive. \nHowever flawed his arguments, the 2020 Ben Shapiro was at least eager to defend the right from claims that it is racist, oblivious to injustice or eager to embrace violence. The 2025 Ben Shapiro seems hell-bent on proving him wrong.\nRadley Balko\nRadley Balko is a writer and investigative journalist who publishes the newsletter .", "title": "Ben Shapiro's reversal from condemning Derek Chauvin's murder of George Floyd to seeking his pardon reflects the Republican Party's embrace of far-right ideologies and systemic racism denial since 2020.", "summary": "In the five years since George Floyd's murder, the Republican Party's stance has drastically shifted.

And stocks have struggled to make any headway since then._\n_Now, with the S &P 500 still stuck near 6000 and trading down just 2% from its all-time high, the vast majority of investors have turned bearish._\n_It 's remarkable that two months of choppy, back-and-forth action can create that drastic a shift in sentiment. This is the sort of bearish reading we'd typically get following a 10% to 15% decline in the market._\n_So, there 's plenty of fuel to power the stock market higher from here._\nJeff highlights three indicators: Moving Average Convergence/Divergence, the Relative Strength Index, and the Commodity Channel Index, all of which have been trading recently in neutral territory.\nWhile such readings mean the S&P could break lower, Jeff believes it's more likely that bulls will reassert their dominance:\n_We are entering the seasonally bullish month of March. And the Volatility Index just generated its first buy signal of 2025. So, the bulls have a slight edge here \u2026_\nReturning to the AAII Sentiment Survey, remember, the emotional pendulum swings both ways.\nExcessive fear always gives way to new bullishness\u2026eventually. And recent, heightened levels of fear suggest that a bullish reversal could be fast approaching.\nBack to Jeff for what he's doing about that:\n_If stocks start to move higher, then we could see a dramatic rally over the next few weeks as bearish investors flip to bullish and chase stock prices higher._\n_Traders should use any weakness over the next few days as a chance to add long exposure to the stock market._\nOne sector to be bullish on today \nSolar.\nBefore we dive into those details, for newer _Digest_ readers, Eric is our global macro expert and the analyst behind _**Investment Report**_.\nHe's also one of the most successful analysts in the newsletter industry, having identified 42 different 1,000%+ returning investments over his multi-decade career. That's more than anyone we know of in our business.\nIn Eric's latest issue of _**Investment Report**_ , he made the case for why it's time to add solar stocks to your portfolio.\nFrom Eric:\n_No other domestic energy source is growing faster._\n_Last year, solar installations accounted for a record-high 64% of all new U.S. electricity-generating capacity - up from 36% three years ago and 23% six years ago. This renewable energy source now produces enough electricity annually to power one quarter of all U.S. homes._\n_Meanwhile, domestic solar-module manufacturing capacity is also ramping higher._\n_During the last two years, manufacturing capacity has quadrupled, from less than 10 GW to nearly 40 GW. This year, capacity is on track to surge again to 66 GW._\nBut what about President Trump's disdain for what he's called the \"Green New Scam\" and his plans to \"Drill, baby, drill\" for fossil fuel energy? Is that not a headwind to solar?\nBack to Eric:\n_Most of this new [solar] manufacturing capacity is popping up in \"red states,\" which is one of many reasons why the Trump administration might treat the industry kindly\u2026_\n_[Plus, Trump] has stated several times that he \"hates wind.\" By contrast, he famously stated last year that he's \"a big fan of solar.\"_\nEric goes on to highlight a second reason why solar power will continue to thrive during the current Trump administration\u2026\nGrowth is the path of least resistance.\nThe U.S. desperately needs more power. The nation's soaring demand for energy - led by the data center construction boom - will require an all-hands-on-deck solution.\nRemember, last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that next-generation AI will need 100 times more computing than older models due to new reasoning approaches.\nFrom Huang:\n_The amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do._\nSolar is one of the cheapest ways to power such computing needs. So, even if Trump favors policies that encourage oil and gas development, he's unlikely to enact policies that actively discourage solar.\nAs usual, Eric includes far more details that make the case for why he's bullish on solar today. If you're an _**Investment Report**_ subscriber, click here to log in to read your Monthly Issue.\nFor an easy way to play the solar opportunity, check out the Global X Solar ETF, RAYS. It holds leading solar stocks including Enphase Energy, First Solar, and Sunrun. Just be aware that of your top 10 holdings, six are Chinese companies. So, watch out for trade wars.\nAs to how Eric is playing it, his preferred investment is trading near a four-year low, and Eric believes \"a double is well within reach.\"\nYou can learn more about it as an _**Investment Report**_ subscriber by clicking here.\nFinally, has Bitcoin bottomed? \nBitcoin rallied over the weekend after President Trump announced the creation of a \"strategic crypto reserve\" that will include bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token and Cardano's ADA.\nFrom Trump on Truth Social:\n_A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World._\nIn a follow-up post, Trump added:\n_And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve._ Bitcoin popped over $93,000 in the wake of the news though it has pulled back to about $90,000 as I write Monday morning.\nStepping back, Bitcoin has fallen sharply in recent weeks \nAfter notching an all-time high in December near $108,000, the grandaddy crypto fell below $85,000 last week. Meanwhile, many leading altcoins have full-on crashed 50% or worse.\nDespite the sector gains over the weekend, many bears continue to predict Bitcoin's demise. Perhaps they'll be right (though they've all been wrong so far).\nBut if they're going to be right, they're fighting an uphill battle against today's incentive structure.\nConsider this\u2026\nWho is incentivized for Bitcoin's price to rise? Simultaneously, who is in a position to help create the conditions for that rise to happen?\nWe got a clue over the weekend.\nTrump.\nBut he's not the only one. Here are a few other such individuals\u2026\n  * Vice President JD Vance: He's recognized as the first Bitcoin owner to hold the vice presidency\n  * Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent: This former hedge fund manager and multi-millionaire is known for his pro-crypto stance\n  * Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick: He's the former CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, where he invested significantly in crypto. He is quoted as saying, \"Do I own Bitcoin? Of course, I do. Does Cantor Fitzgerald own Bitcoin? A shitload of Bitcoin.\"\n\n\nBottom line: Whether you love or hate Bitcoin\u2026 whether you love or hate the current administration\u2026 when you follow the incentive structure\u2026 you'll see a reason to remain bullish on Bitcoin.\nAnd it's not just Bitcoin. We expect select altcoins to reward investors handsomely here in 2025. Trump mentioned a few in his post, but there will be others.\nIn fact, our crypto expert Luke Lango believes this could be the year of huge altcoin gains, similar to 2021 when dozens of altcoins rallied more than 5,000% in a single year.\nTo help him identify the most lucrative opportunities, Luke is using a quant-based trading algorithm he and his team recently created. It puts the focus squarely on the one thing that matters when you're trading altcoins - price.\nSpecifically, the tool is engineered to identify price breakouts that suggest a continuation of gains based on momentum. **To learn more, click here**.\nWe'll keep you updated on all these stories here in the _Digest_.\nHave a good evening, \nJeff Remsburg\nThe post The Bullish Trade Set-ups Today appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "title": "Jeff Clark identifies contrarian bullish signals in low investor sentiment and technical indicators, while Eric Fry emphasizes solar energy's rapid growth and bipartisan support, and Trump's crypto reserve announcement fuels Bitcoin's recovery.", "summary": "Contrarian indicators suggest it's time to buy on weakness in the stock market, according to Jeff Clark.

From negotiating restaurant management contracts to helping brands expand globally, her legal expertise ensures that operators aren't just protected \u2014 but positioned for success.\nAnd one of the biggest mistakes she sees? Not protecting the brand.\n**Related:Your Guests All Want the Same Thing, Says This Hotel Food and Beverage Consultant \u2014 Here's What**\n## Protecting your brand\nFor many restaurant operators, the legal side of branding is an afterthought. They build a great concept, launch a killer menu and grow a loyal following \u2014 only to realize too late that they never protected their name.\n\"Operators don't always think about trademarking their brand early on,\" Reuter says. \"But if you don't protect your name, someone else will. And once you lose control of your brand, it's almost impossible to get it back.\"\nA strong trademark isn't just a legal technicality \u2014 it's the foundation of a restaurant's long-term success. Whether it's licensing opportunities, expansion plans or simply keeping a competitor from stealing the name, Reuter ensures her clients stay in control.\nAt the end of the day, Reuter's job is about more than contracts and negotiations. It's about protecting the people and businesses of which she believes.\n\"My job isn't just to review contracts,\" she says. \"It's to make sure my clients aren't signing something that could hurt them years down the road.\"\nThat's why she fights for every deal like it's her own. Because in hospitality, the right lawyer isn't just an advisor \u2014 they're a partner in the business.\n**Related:To Make the Perfect Cocktail, You Need Collaboration.

And what it means is that it is getting more and more challenging to stand out, be unique and ensure your brand's voice is heard.\nContent saturation is a real threat, especially in competitive fields such as B2B, SaaS and ecommerce. Unoriginal content can overwhelm your audience, drive down engagement and make it even more harrowing to climb the search engine rankings.\nConsidering that situation, the knee-jerk reaction might be to scale back or become more conservative in sharing information. However, that would be wrong.\nInstead of pumping the breaks, it's time to rethink your approach and get more thoughtful about how you cut through all of that content clutter.\n**Related:How to Stand Out in a Crowded Content Marketing Space**\n## **The key factors fueling content saturation**\nContent saturation isn't a coincidence nor entirely out of left field or unexpected. Instead, it results from several forces converging in the digital world \u2014 a \"perfect storm,\" if you will.\nHere's why it's happening:\n  * **The copycat culture:** Too many brands and entrepreneurs are cutting corners and taking the shortcut of replicating what works for others, often without bringing anything fresh, original or insightful, while slapping the label of \"Thought Leader\" on themselves. This leads to an endless cycle of vanilla sameness, making it harder for any voice to stand out \u2026 even when they might have something to say.\n  * **Platform preferences:** Search engines, like Google, and social media channels, like Facebook and LinkedIn, are built to favor content that drives engagement \u2014 enabling the cream to rise to the top. This means that well-crafted, albeit generic, content gets buried underneath an avalanche of content begging for attention.\n  * **Audience fatigue:** Our brains are flooded daily with blogs, emails, ads and social media content. This constant barrage leads to content burnout, leaving consumers less inclined to engage with any brand that doesn't immediately grab their attention (and let's face it ... combine that fatigue with _very_ short attention spans \u2026 and Houston, we have a problem).\n  * **The rise of AI-generated content:** There's no use in beating around the bush. AI is both a blessing and a curse to content creators. And the people using it without thinking about how they're using it are at fault. By simply churning out AI content without a focused intent, the content that is spewed out reads like the back of a cereal box. It lacks personality, empathy and depth. All things that actual human audiences crave and desire.\n\n\n**Related:Is Your Content Getting Lost in the Crowd? Use This Powerful SEO Technique to Make It Stand Out.**\n## Cutting through the noise\nWhen you're neck deep in the content saturation swamp, the first thing to remember is this: It's not about stopping content creation; it's about elevating it.\nSo, how do you rise above the noise?\nHere are some actionable ways to cut through nonsense and reclaim your place in the spotlight.\n**1. Create insightful, experience-based content:** Generic content isn't going to get you far anymore. To stand out, infuse your writing with unique insights from real-world experiences, proprietary data or expert opinions. People are looking for authentic, genuine, emotional and entertaining content. A reader wants to hear about actual challenges and solutions \u2014 not about some random, abstract, fictionalized situation.\n  * **Example** : Instead of a post titled \"X Social Media Tips for B2B Businesses,\" offer something more unique, such as \"How This Social Strategy Led to a 300% Increase in Engagement in 3 Months.\" This provides real-world value, a fresh perspective and a barrier to copycats.\n\n\n**2. Focus on original thought leadership:** You'll get lost in the crowd if you can't challenge the status quo. Develop a strong point of view on industry trends and be able to back it up. Being a thought leader isn't about stating what's popular \u2014 it's supposed to get someone to think.\n  * **Example** : When everyone else is shouting \"SEO is Dead\" from the rooftops, it's your job to explain how it's evolving \u2014 and why it's not going away and provide real data and insights to back your claim.\n\n\n**3. Prioritize interactive and engaging formats:** Blogs are great, but try diversifying your content. Use podcasts, videos, webinars, live Q&As, interactive tools and infographics \u2014 and share them across owned, earned and paid media.\n**4. Refresh and repurpose high-performing content:** You don't have to reinvent the wheel when creating content. Sometimes, you need to polish up something to make it look brand new. Revise old content with fresh data or turn existing content into a different format, like a LinkedIn carousel post, a quick explainer video or a podcast episode.\n**5. Leverage niche and long-tail keywords:** Don't waste time competing for broad and competitive keywords. Instead, target phrases your audience is searching for.\n  * **Example** : Rather than \"blankets,\" go after \"Washable Wool Blankets\" (assuming your blanket is made of wool).\n\n\n**6. Build authority with data and research:** People desire new information \u2014 especially if numbers accompany it. Conduct original research or partner with a credible source to offer something unique.\n**7. Invest in personal branding, user-generated content (UGC) and employee advocacy:** People trust people more than brands \u2014 organic reach soars when your customers or employees share content. Content resonates when it feels real, of the moment and unscripted.\n**8. Improve readability:** Your content has to hold a person's attention \u2014 so you have only a few seconds to grab them. Short paragraphs and bullet points are great for skimmers. Storytelling is ideal for engaged readers. And real-world experiences and case studies are key to credibility.\n**9. Measure and adjust:** Track what is working and hold a funeral for what isn't. Don't double down on content your audience is rejecting and spin your wheels.\n**Related:Cutting Through the Noise: A Guide to Messaging in an Age of Marketing Saturation**\nContent saturation might be here to stay, but that doesn't mean it's the end of your story. Rather, consider it an opportunity to push the boundaries, innovate and show the actual value of what you create. When you focus on the value and uniqueness of your distribution, you'll rise above the noise.\nRemember, the key isn't about quantity; it's about quality.

I'd smile at passersby and often wave to nearby business owners, hoping to spark connections beyond simple introductions. I love how our local community is a vibrant network of individuals whose unique contributions enrich everything we do.\nBuilding a business is an evolving process, much like tending to a long-term project. It requires patience, dedication and the right resources to grow. Along the way, you lean on a network of advisors, peers and collaborators whose input and support play an essential role in helping the business thrive. Just as no entrepreneur can build a successful business alone, no one can fully develop a venture without the guidance and camaraderie of others in the ecosystem.\nLet me tell you why your environment matters so profoundly and give you three practical steps to begin participating in your community.\n## Why community involvement is vital in building your business\nReal trust forms when people see that your values align with theirs. No advertising campaign can replicate the feeling of generosity or genuine care that you show when you support a local youth program or help organize a neighborhood clean-up. As neighbors become familiar with your name, a deep sense of respect and confidence grows, something that you simply can't purchase with ads or clever marketing alone.\nEngaging with the community naturally allows for meaningful connections with people with diverse backgrounds. One moment, you might be engaged in a thoughtful conversation with a local teacher about her students' needs; the next, you're sharing insights with a small business owner who is equally devoted to sustainable practices. These chance encounters may develop into deeper relationships or guide you to resources that can elevate your business one way or another.\n**Related:5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Enhance Local Communities**\nDuring challenging economic cycles or moments of uncertainty, the community you've helped support is likely to rally around you. They're friends and allies who appreciate your presence and will go the extra mile to keep your doors open.\nThese three key steps help you begin participating in your community.\n## 1. Assess community needs\nIt's easy to assume you already know what your community needs \u2014 it may even be the very reason you put up your business there. But true understanding requires pausing to listen with an open heart. Start by seeking input through both formal and informal channels. Ask questions when they visit your business or when you meet them at local gatherings.\nBe specific \u2014 something like, \"What do you think our neighborhood needs most right now?\" invites a more thoughtful response than a generic \"How are you doing?\"\n## 2. Attend community events\nNext, become a visible participant in the day-to-day rhythm of your area. When you show up at community events, you share in local traditions and communicate, \"I'm here, and I want to be a part of this.\"\nAs you attend and participate, remember that people can sense authenticity. Approach these events as an opportunity to learn about your neighbors' experiences, not merely a platform to promote your brand, and hope to get referrals by the end of the night.\n**Related:4 Ways Small Business Owners Can Capitalize on Big Events**\n## 3. Connect with local organizations\nOnce you have a handle on community needs and have begun attending local events, seek out organizations that share your vision for improving the community.\nFrom nonprofits and advocacy groups to school clubs and mentorship programs, many organizations are already serving your area. Get to know their leader and explore ways your business can collaborate to expand their reach while furthering your own mission.\nCommunity-centered partnerships thrive when they last beyond a single event or campaign. Check-in regularly, celebrate each other's successes and be there in times of need. As you strengthen these bonds, you'll find more opportunities to make a positive difference \u2014 and your business will naturally grow alongside these goodwill efforts.\n## **Positive outcomes and benefits to look forward to**\nWhen you regularly invest in community involvement, the benefits often come full circle:\n  * **Heightened brand reputation:** You become known for more than just your products or services \u2014 you're recognized for kindness, reliability and genuine care. This reputation can't be fabricated; it grows organically from your consistent presence.\n  * **Robust word-of-mouth:** Happy neighbors share their stories, whether it's about the free workshops you offered, the local park you helped revitalize, or their experience in your lovely and fun office. Their sincere testimonials often carry more weight than traditional Facebook Ads.\n  * **Deeper personal fulfillment:** On a purely human level, there's a comforting sense of purpose that accompanies serving others. When you know that your efforts have eased someone's burden or brightened a family's day, it can be deeply rewarding and keep you motivated to lead with compassion.\n\n\nUltimately, weaving community involvement into your entrepreneurial journey lays a strong foundation for lasting success. Actively listen to local needs, show up with warmth at events and form genuine partnerships with organizations. This way, you're creating a living tapestry of support \u2014 one that benefits not just your bottom line but also the people who share your corner of the world.\nEmbrace your role as both a leader and a neighbor, and I guarantee your business will thrive on the strength of these cherished relationships.\nDr. Kemia Zeinali\nEntrepreneur Leadership Network\u00ae Contributor\nFounder of Dreamhouse Dental\nDr. Kemia Zeinali, MBA, is the Founder, CEO and lead of Dreamhouse Dental in Los Angeles, CA. \nWant to be an Entrepreneur Leadership Network contributor?

What\u2019s the future of that look like? I know that the, there\u2019s an idea that the U. S. piece of this might somehow end up in U.S. hands. How does that look? What, who\u2019s looking at it? Is it Microsoft? I mean, who\u2019s looking at it? I,\n[00:00:28] **Lee Jackson:** I hear a new voice on this every day. A couple of days ago, it was Oracle and Larry Ellison and, you know, the government taking a chunk of it, but then more recently, I\u2019m hearing it. That Microsoft is involved in a purchase, and I think we\u2019ve had this discussion that if anybody could benefit from TikTok, it would be some huge corporation that could like a Microsoft that could afford it, but does Microsoft really want to have social media as a part of their game You know, Azure and, and, and, and there are other products are a big part.\n[00:01:05] **Lee Jackson:** So I\u2019m not really sure. I think there\u2019s a lot of balls in the air on this.\n[00:01:09] **Doug McIntyre:** Well, I think there\u2019s a reputation problem with owning TikTok, but I\u2019m just saying you mentioned Microsoft. I understand that. Okay, maybe they\u2019ve got the money, they\u2019re in the tech industry, but I would look at these things.\n[00:01:24] **Doug McIntyre:** Number one, why do you want to compete with Meta, who\u2019s already got a huge lead, I think, across all their social media, they have 3 billion, 3 billion users, and you\u2019re also competing with on X. And you know, so you have a bunch of competition. You have execution risk on this because you have to get rid of the algorithms, the Chinese use, the, but you have them, you got to find new algorithms, I expect.\n[00:01:56] **Doug McIntyre:** But do you really want to own Something with hate speech, you know, something where there\u2019s a lot of misleading information, something where there\u2019s worries that, you know, foreign agents, whether it\u2019s North Korea, Russia, try to hack into the thing, put false information there. I don\u2019t see it for that reason and one other.\n[00:02:18] **Doug McIntyre:** Microsoft\u2019s core businesses, and this is the way it\u2019s sold itself to Wall Street, We are in the cloud business and we\u2019re moving into the AI business. We have a bunch of legacy businesses and you should love them and everything else, but the future of Microsoft is in these businesses. Basically all the other mega tech companies are singing a very similar tune.\n[00:02:40] **Doug McIntyre:** Right. To me, this is a non core asset. So why do you want to buy something that has a reputation risk and that\u2019s not a non core asset?\n[00:02:51] **Lee Jackson:** Yeah, I agree. And the one thing that\u2019s kind of interesting about this, and this is where Zuckerberg is smart, in that TikTok as a whole skews to a much younger audience, whereas Facebook skews to an older audience.\n[00:03:06] **Lee Jackson:** Kids in their teens and 20s. They don\u2019t use Facebook. I mean, they, they maybe have a Facebook page that they\u2019ve had for 15 years, but way that Zuckerberg structured it with Instagram, you know, the, the young people are younger to people in their late twenties, early thirties than in their forties. They use Instagram, and so he\u2019s got the demo covered better.\n[00:03:30] **Lee Jackson:** And TikTok skews much younger and it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s teenagers dancing and singing and, you know, influencing. And I just don\u2019t know that that\u2019s that it will ever change a whole lot from that. I mean, it\u2019s cool. And I\u2019ve seen cool stuff on TikTok. But, I don\u2019t know if, if, if Microsoft would want to commit, it\u2019s almost better for Oracle, I think, to commit to it than, than Microsoft, if you\u2019re just thinking big tech, but yeah, there could be, there could be a lot of needles hidden in there and, and who knows.\n[00:04:03] **Doug McIntyre:** Any big tech company that offers to buy this or it looks like they will where there\u2019s any real money involved to me that turns that stock into a sell.\n[00:04:12] **Lee Jackson:** Well, it\u2019s not going to be cheap. I mean, we\u2019ve heard 50 billion that ByteDance wants and they\u2019re going to want to keep a chunk of it somehow. So, you know, do they, do they, do they, do they pay ByteDance a big chunk and then take it public?\n[00:04:26] **Lee Jackson:** Or do they keep it private? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll tell you one thing. I don\u2019t think that the demographics of that are going to skew a lot higher to the, because yeah, there\u2019s lots of kids on it and people make a lot of money on it, dancing and doing all that stuff, but the main thing that is good for Zuckerberg, especially for Facebook, is it skews older to people that have more money.\n[00:04:49] **Lee Jackson:** And, you know, ultimately for any sort of media you want, you know, the 18 to 36 is great, but you really like the 35 to 55 demo because they have all the dough.\n[00:05:01] **Doug McIntyre:** So my view of this is any megatech that buys this other than meta to me becomes a sell that day if they pay, you know If it\u2019s a 50 billion dollar valuation, I\u2019m a seller of Oracle.\n[00:05:15] **Doug McIntyre:** I\u2019m a seller of Microsoft if those things happen\n[00:05:17] **Lee Jackson:** Yeah, and they and you know what? And you might want to see because whoever would buy it will probably skew higher initially and then probably trade d give it a little legs, let it go creep up a little bit. The interesting thing is in and back then, essenti son was like, listen man, you need to be longer to skew to the younger voter, and he did tremendous with the young in this vote. I mean, the last one that did really good with the young, I think, was George W. Bush, and that was 20 years ago. So, it\u2019ll be really interesting to see how this plays out. But, they\u2019ve bought themselves some times and you can bet because the way Wall Street runs and investment banking runs, they want to get a deal done.\nThe post \"TikTok Has More Problems Than Opportunities, and If Oracle (ORCL) or Microsoft (MSFT) Buy It, They Become A Sell The Next Day\" appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "title": "Microsoft and Oracle face significant risks acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations due to valuation overhang, regulatory hurdles, and strategic misalignment with their core cloud/AI businesses, while Meta's platform diversity maintains its social media dominance.", "summary": "Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) are speculated to be potential bidders for TikTok's U.S. operations, valued at $50 billion.

We mostly talk about Lucid and Rivian were always worried. They\u2019re not going to make it. They\u2019ve got, you know, too much competition. Now one of their peer, what I would call their peer companies, looks like they won\u2019t make it. Can you tell us about that?\n[00:00:23] **Lee Jackson:** Well, you know born out of the SPAC boom that was born out of the COVID meltdown was Nikola, which is a company that was going to have a real hot truck. They basically have said that the chances that they\u2019re going to remain an ongoing concern could be doubtful. I mean, I think the stock\u2019s under a dollar and it\u2019s, it\u2019s a donut.\n[00:00:48] **Lee Jackson:** And the CEO, to the best of my knowledge, has been put in prison. for wire fraud and all sorts of nonsense like that. And I think they\u2019re doomed. I mean, they\u2019re going to be a donut. The question is for investors in EV, what happens to Lucid? It\u2019s trading at two or three bucks. Now, Rivian bounced a little bit on the Volkswagen deal, but I don\u2019t know.\n[00:01:13] **Lee Jackson:** I think the future is still a wild card. And like we\u2019ve talked about recently, BYD (BYDDF), BYD that Warren Buffet owns a big pile of, has a truck that apparently in Australia, Mexico, and any place they can sell it is selling like ba gangbusters. So, yeah, I think Nikola, if you have that, just write it off.\n[00:01:34] **Lee Jackson:** That\u2019s a loss. And the others be careful.\n[00:01:37] **Doug McIntyre:** Well, yeah, to me this says that we\u2019re at the start of a, of some dominoes going. Yeah. So you\u2019ve got one, you\u2019ve got two more that I understand that you got Volkswagen, which is a deep trouble itself. You\u2019ve got, you know, some Saudi investors involved in these. But the point to me is basically Tesla has 50 percent of the EV market in the United States, right?\n[00:02:02] **Doug McIntyre:** Ford GM and the Hyundai Kia, company each have about eight or 9%. Now those three companies have dealers. Right. They have deep pockets, which has been proven by the fact that they\u2019ve set billions of dollars on fire, moving money into the business. But they, they are, they do have a big toehold in the US market now.\n[00:02:31] **Doug McIntyre:** I think that they\u2019re super heavy spending is behind them. They\u2019re, they\u2019re coming with new models into the market every year. And the thing I don\u2019t like about Lucid and Rivian now is, is that. Used to be able to say, well, they really just compete against Tesla, but that isn\u2019t true anymore. No, you now got some Significant players in the US market which makes their position even worse.\n[00:02:59] **Lee Jackson:** Yeah Well again, Nikola is a donut the other ones I mean, lucid, lucid cars look cool and they really do look cool and the interiors are cool. But I mean, they\u2019re very expensive. Same with Rivian. They\u2019re very expensive. The BYD vehicles that are so popular aren\u2019t 80, 000 and really, if you want to own EVs, either own Tesla or own Berkshire Hathaway because Warren Buffett has a big chunk of it in there.\n[00:03:32] **Doug McIntyre:** Well, yeah. And the last thing I would say about, Lucid and Rivian is, is that if the EV industry has learned anything, it\u2019s that people want to be able to buy an EV for 25, 000.

Indeed, a Tesla is \u201cfully loaded\u201d on the tech, whether we\u2019re talking about the exterior, interior, or under the hood. Indeed, it\u2019s what\u2019s under the hood, I believe, that sets Tesla apart from the rest of the pack in the auto scene.\n### Key Points\n  * Tesla stock has a lot of impressive and emerging AI innovations going on underneath the hood!\n  * Perhaps it\u2019s time investors thought of Tesla as a sort of \u201cembodied AI ETF,\u201d as Morgan Stanley does.\n  * Last year we published our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report that highlighted a company that would soon become NVIDIA\u2019s greatest threat. The company\u2019s stock jumped 40% in the two days after its last earnings. Another stock we recommended jumped 24% on Tuesday. The report is absolutely free and comes with 38 pages of in-depth research on top AI stock ideas. However, it\u2019s only available for a limited time. Click here to learn more and grab your complimentary copy.\n\n\nWhether we\u2019re talking about the autonomous capabilities or the intriguing hardware, Tesla drivers are pretty much driving in a giant computer. But can the same be said for just about any modern car? Possibly. Tesla vehicles aren\u2019t the only ones with an Autopilot-esque feature.\nReportedly, Consumer Report deems Tesla\u2019s driver assistance system as good but not the best. Of course, there\u2019s still much work to be done as Tesla races toward a future that sees Cybercabs on more roads. As Cybercab goes full speed ahead for a big piece of that robotaxi market, perhaps things could quickly change.\nWith hefty AI investment from Elon Musk and perhaps a smarter Tesla, it may not be all too far off. Indeed, as we move further into the AI age, one that could find its way into a \u201cphysical form\u201d (think robots, cars, and all the sort), Tesla stands out as a major potential winner. After all, there is no bigger robot on the market than a modern vehicle!\nCombined with Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robot, which could be coming to a household near you, it seems like Tesla stock is not just an AI play but akin to an AI ETF (exchange-traded fund), with numerous ways to profit and grow from the meteoric rise of the technology.\n## Wall Street pro sees Tesla stock as an \u201cembodied\u201d AI ETF\u2014he\u2019s right.\n**Morgan Stanley** (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas views Tesla as like an \u201cAI ETF,\u201d and I\u2019m inclined to agree, even if it\u2019s not yet a profound money-maker for the firm.\nAdditionally, he sees an opportunity for Elon Musk\u2019s empire to become a leader in \u201cembodied AI,\u201d or robotics. The firm seems to have made all the right bets in all the right places to be one of the more compelling diversified AI stocks in the market.\nIndeed, autonomous vehicles may very well be scratching the surface of the AI potential the firm is capable of. House robots, AI-powered energy optimization, AI chips, AI data centers, and other efforts not yet on our radar (perhaps a Tesla language model catered to drivers) could also play a larger role in the automaker\u2019s future.\n## Is this AI ETF too expensive at current prices?\nTesla stock is now down over 18% from its year-end all-time high, just a few dollars shy of the $500 per-share level. To some, this dip is a great buying opportunity to ride the \u201cembodied\u201d AI play higher in what could be another big year of the AI boom. However, the valuation remains steep, and the volatility is stomach-churning, with a 2.3 beta, entailing a far bumpier ride than the S&P 500.\nAlso, if Trump tariffs are implemented, demand for vehicles could take a big hit. Of course, given Elon Musk\u2019s friendship with President Trump, I do think the last thing Trump would want to do is to put forth policies that weigh on Tesla vehicle sales. Either way, I think Tesla is an interesting pick-up despite tariff uncertainties. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a go-to robot stock (or ETF-like bet) that may very well deserve to trade at close to 14 times price-to-sales (P/S).\nOf course, the big question is what the new product timeline will look like, given the potential for road bumps along the route to a robotics revolution. If you\u2019re fine with volatility and are keen on betting big on the physical AI phase of the revolution, perhaps waiting for a bit more of a pullback, perhaps closer to $350 per share, could be a smart move. In my view, TSLA stock is mildly expensive, with a technical picture that\u2019s not the best in the world.\nThe post Tesla Stock Like an \u201cAI ETF, \u201d Says Wall Street Pro appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "title": "Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas positions Tesla as an 'embodied AI ETF' leveraging autonomous vehicle advancements and robotics, though its valuation and political risks influence investment considerations.", "summary": "Tesla's innovative use of AI technology, both in its autonomous vehicles and hardware, has led some to view the company as an _embodied AI ETF_ (exchange-traded fund).

And then the Trump administration ordered the job to be completed in just 30 days.\nFederal officials revealed the deadline on Jan. 29, days after President Donald Trump met with survivors of the Pacific Palisades fire. The US Environmental Protection Agency said that it\u2019s been \u201ctasked\u201d with finishing the household hazardous materials cleanup within a month.\n**Related:USAA Becomes 3rd Insurer to Report $1B-Plus in Claims So Far for LA Wildfires**\nBut the vast scale of the damage is testing the government\u2019s well-honed wildfire playbook and signals the growing challenge of responding to ever-more frequent and destructive climate disasters. It took the EPA more than three months to remove hazardous debris from 1,448 residential and commercial properties incinerated in the 2023 Lahaina wildfire in Hawaii.\nLA has nearly 10 times the number of destroyed buildings and at least five times as many potentially explosive electric vehicles abandoned in fire zones that must be disarmed. \u201cWe find that the majority of residences and commercial structures that we address will have some sort of hazardous material on the property, even if it\u2019s fully burned,\u201d Tara Fitzgerald, the EPA incident commander for the LA wildfires, said in an interview.\nHundreds of thousands of pounds of pesticides, paints, asbestos, fuel tanks and other toxic household items must be located amid the rubble of thousands of homes. Routes must be planned for fleets of trucks to haul away the hazardous waste. The handling of explosive lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles and home energy storage systems requires dispatching specialized teams.\nAppropriate sites must be found to receive all that toxic waste and temporary facilities built to sort and package it for safe transport to disposal sites, which also must be lined up. That\u2019s just Phase One of the cleanup. In Phase Two, the rubble\u2014trees, walls, chimneys, foundations\u2014will be removed and transported to landfills. Most properties are likely contaminated with toxic ash, so half a foot of soil will be excavated from the ruins. Last week, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials projected that 80% to 90% of properties in Phase Two will be cleared of debris and ready for reconstruction in a year or less; that\u2019s after an original estimate of 18 months.\n**Measuring Hazardous Waste from US Wildfires**\nThe costs are likely to be immense: Economists at the University of California at Los Angeles estimated this week that total property and capital losses from the fires will be as much as $164 billion. The federal government under President Joe Biden agreed to pay for initial cleanup costs. California Governor Gavin Newsom traveled to Washington this week to meet with US Congress members and Trump to try to secure additional funding for the recovery.\nLos Angeles officials, Newsom and residents have also pressed for a speedy cleanup. \u201cA lot of people are in a hurry, very angry and anxious,\u201d said Sue Kohl, a real estate agent and president of the Pacific Palisades Community Council, who lost her home of 31 years.\nThat\u2019s left the EPA scrambling to find more processing sites in the face of opposition from communities that are hosting the facilities and fear contamination from burn sites.\n\u201cMy concern is that I feel like they\u2019re rushing your team, and when you are rushed to do something, there is a big risk of human error,\u201d Cesar Garcia, mayor of the Los Angeles County city of Duarte, told Fitzgerald at a raucous town hall meeting held last week. Garcia and other local leaders called the gathering in Duarte after they discovered the EPA had opened a hazardous waste processing station near their communities about 15 miles from Altadena, where the Eaton Fire incinerated some 9,400 structures.\n\u201cRegardless of the speed that we work, we do have to do the work safely,\u201d Fitzgerald said over angry shouts of \u201cWe don\u2019t want it! Go somewhere else!\u201d from the audience.\nIt\u2019s one of two facilities initially planned to process and package hazardous materials for disposal. A second site just outside Malibu is handling toxic debris from more than 6,800 buildings that burned in nearby Pacific Palisades. On Friday, Malibu residents staged a protest at the oceanside depot. Dressed in protective gear and carrying signs that said \u201cNo Toxic Debris at Topanga Lagoon\u201d and \u201cSurfers Unite, Protect Water,\u201d they demonstrated across from beaches closed due to toxic runoff from the wildfires.\nAt the meeting in Duarte, Fitzgerald emphasized that the agency has successfully removed hazardous waste from many destructive wildfires over the past decade.\nThe LA wildfires, however, present unique challenges.\nIn Pacific Palisades last Thursday, a cleanup crew carefully tread through the remains of multimillion-dollar homes so obliterated that only chimneys distinguished one property from another on streetscapes reduced to rubble. It was the fourth day of the Phase One hazardous waste cleanup and by the weekend as many as 1,000 workers would fan out to locate and remove ordinary household items turned toxic by the wildfires\u2019 extreme heat.\nClifford Franklin, 74, returned to Altadena two weeks ago to discover his home partially razed by the Eaton Fire. The roof had collapsed onto his garage, and half of the house was gone, as were the rest of the dwellings on his block. A yellow tag hung on the front door warning Franklin not to enter the garage, where he had stored paint, aerosol cans, a big-screen television and a propane grill.\n\u201cYou could smell the toxicity,\u201d said Franklin, who like many other Angelenos is concerned about the hazards. He\u2019s particularly worried about his neighbors\u2019 electric cars that burned in the inferno.\nSome 400,000 electric vehicles are registered in Los Angeles County, and the proliferation of highly flammable lithium-ion batteries in EVs and home energy storage systems has complicated cleanups. Specialist teams are needed to defuse what EPA officials describe as \u201cunexploded ordnance.\u201d\nThe 2023 Lahaina wildfire that leveled the historic Maui town was the first conflagration where cleanup crews encountered a significant number of electric cars, according to Chris Myers, the EPA\u2019s lithium-ion battery technical specialist for the L.A. fires. They processed 94 vehicles in Hawaii; Myers expects to find more than 500 electric cars, including hybrid vehicles, in the L.A. burn zones.\nA fire-damaged battery pack can emit toxic gases or ignite days, weeks or months after a wildfire. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very unpredictable situation,\u201d said Myers on Thursday as he stood outside the ruins of what once was a sprawling $7 million modernist home overlooking a canyon in Pacific Palisades. A charred Tesla Model Y sat in the driveway framed by scorched palm trees.\nA reconnaissance team had spray-painted blue lightning bolts on the Tesla to alert cleanup crews to the presence of a battery pack. A Toyota Prius next door and another one across the street also bore blue bolts. While Tesla\u2019s have distinctive shapes that are easily recognizable even when only a shell is left, other vehicles require further investigation to determine if what looks like a gasoline car actually is an electric or hybrid version of the model.\n**Related:LA Wildfire Losses Seen as High as $164 Billion, UCLA Says**\nTypically it takes an eight-person squad to remove a car\u2019s battery pack. Four people wearing respirators, hard hats, gloves and other protective clothing surrounded the Model Y while others stood 75 feet away. \u201cIf something goes bad, we\u2019re going to hear a pop\u201d of toxic gas, said EPA official Stephen Ball. After a worker sawed through the car\u2019s roof pillars, another in a backhoe lifted off the top and crushed the body. The backhoe operator then flipped over the chassis so thousands of shotgun shell-shaped battery cells could be removed and stored in black buckets.\nCells that could still ignite are wrapped in fire blankets for transport to the Malibu processing center where the batteries will be soaked in a brine solution to deenergize them. A machine will shred the batteries for disposal at a recycling center or landfill.\nThe crew then convoyed to the ruins of an Arts and Crafts-style home a few blocks away where records showed that two Tesla Powerwall lithium-ion battery storage systems had been installed on the northeast corner of the house. No walls remained, however, and there was no sign of the Powerwalls, which could be buried under piles of debris.\nThat rubble will be removed in Phase Two of the cleanup, overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Once the EPA certifies a property is clear of hazardous waste, contractors move in to haul away burned trees, walls, foundations and toxic ash. There\u2019s no charge to homeowners but they can opt to hire their own certified contractors to remove debris. Once Phase Two is completed on a property, homeowners can begin rebuilding.\nWhen a house burns at high temperatures, toxins in plumbing, nails, sheetrock, appliances and electronic gadgets vaporize and then condense, binding to ash. \u201cIt\u2019s a nasty mix of stuff, mostly metals,\u201d said Anthony Wexler, director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California at Davis. Ash from the LA fires fell across the city and as far as 100 miles off the coast.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m concerned about in L.A. are the ubiquitous leaf blowers that are going to put that ash back up into the air,\u201d added Wexler.\nA study of the 2021 Marshall Fire in Boulder County, Colorado, found elevated levels of toxic metals from the 1,000 houses that burned.

The other week, I watched the heinous AI-generated \u201cTrump Gaza\u201d video and was so appalled that I impulse-bought a kayaking guide book. It felt like the only sane response was to take to the water and paddle away.\nVideo games are a reliable antidote to existential doom, but layoffs, corporate homogenisation and AI slop are all encroaching on my safe haven, making it more difficult to get a brief reprieve from what\u2019s happening in the outside world. Thank God, then, for the Bafta games awards nominations, which reliably remind me that video games are pretty great, actually.\nThe last week (right after my newsletter deadline, as longtime readers will know is now tradition). In my opinion, Bafta\u2019s event is the classiest and least commercial of the gaming awards shows, and its judging panels, with a mix of video game industry professionals and specialists from Bafta\u2019s membership and beyond, usually come out with the broadest range of picks. I always see a lot of what I personally love about video games in these nominations: their sheer creative variation and vivacity. (Disclosure: over the years I\u2019ve been involved with these judging panels in various capacities, but not in 2025.)\nThe eligibility period runs from November 2023 to November 2024, so there are no nominations for the superb Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. (I feel so sorry for great games that come out in December.) One of my favourites I played made the cut: A Highland Song, a magical-realist game about running through the Scottish mountains, is up for best British game, alongside another Scottish-set game called Still Wakes the Deep, a cosmic horror thriller set on a North Sea oil rig. Yorkshire-ish comedy Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here! is also up for this award, as are Lego Horizon Adventures, Paper Trail and Hellblade II.\nHellblade II is actually the most-nominated game overall, appearing in 11 categories. Still Wakes the Deep, meanwhile, appeared in eight, and Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here in seven. If I may be allowed some very mild patriotism, Britain\u2019s games industry should be very proud of its output last year, which was overall a horrid one for those working in the business of play.\nDelightfully, Thank Goodness You\u2019re Here! made it into the best game category with Astro Bot, Black Myth: Wukong, Balatro, Helldivers 2, and Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, a game that I liked less, apparently, than almost everyone else. There are a bunch of big games here in various categories, but what I like about the Baftas is that indie games aren\u2019t relegated to their own specific category: they appear _everywhere_ , resulting in an enjoyably unpredictable slate. The stop-motion submarine puppet adventure game Harold Halibut and the warrior-and-wolf environmentalist action game Neva (a personal fave) are up for the artistic achievement award, next to big titles including Astro Bot and Wukong.\nThe ambiguously named \u201cgames beyond entertainment\u201d category is always my favourite to peruse, partly because of the nebulous definition: these are all games with some kind of message or intended wider meaning. We have Kind Words, in which you send nice messages to strangers or send your worries out into the world. There\u2019s Botany Manor, about exploring the home of a Victorian botanist. Tales of Kenzera: Zau was informed by its director\u2019s grief after the death of his father. Tetris Forever is a fascinating interactive documentary about the block-arranging game, and an insight into a wild period of video game history. Hellblade is in there, too, presumably because of its portrayal of living with psychosis. And then there\u2019s Vampire Therapist, in which you are a cowboy talking the immortal undead through their emotional baggage. I had never heard of this game, and will be downloading it forthwith.\nLast year\u2019s awards were so comprehensively dominated by Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 that the show lacked its usual propensity for surprises, but a lot of the categories this year are much tighter. The show is on 8 April at 7pm BST, hosted once again by comedian Phil Wang, and pretty much everything on this list of nominations would be a worthy winner. That said: if the gloriously clever and maximalist role-playing game Metaphor: ReFantazio doesn\u2019t win best narrative, I\u2019ll be fumin\u2019.\n## What to play\n**Wanderstop** is game is about a formerly fearsome warrior forced to slow the heck down and run a whimsical tea shop in a fantasy forest, and she is not happy about it. It\u2019s also a game about burnout. Co-written by Davey Wreden (The Stanley Parable, The Beginner\u2019s Guide) and Karla Zimonja (Gone Home), it will speak to anyone who has ever overinvested in their work and found the meaning suddenly stripped from their life when they can no longer work like they used to. (No idea what you\u2019re talking about.)\n**Available on** : PS5, Xbox, PC **Estimated playtime** : 10 hours\n## What to read\n  * Inspired by a Bafta survey, I asked a bunch of interesting and distinguished people for their **most influential video game of all time**. No two people picked the same game. Most of their selections were so brilliantly esoteric that I felt distinctly boring for picking something relatively predictable.\n  * Sony has been experimenting with **AI-powered game characters** : an AI version of Aloy from Horizon was , talking to the player in a synthesised voice. Important reminder: Horizon is a story about how greedy technocrats destroyed the earth with the help of AI.\n  * There\u2019s for **The Last of Us** season two, with Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay returning as heroes Joel and Ellie. Those of us who have played the game will know there is, uh, plenty the trailer _doesn\u2019t_ show \u2026\n  * And speaking of trailers, there\u2019s a 10-minute (yes, 10) trailer for **Death Stranding 2** , which will be released on 26 June. Being a Hideo Kojima game, it looks equal parts creative, confusing .\n\n\n## What to click\n  * \u2018A lot worse than expected\u2019: AI Pac-Man clones, reviewed\n  * Are AI-generated video games really on the horizon?\n  * Atomfall, the survival game that draws from classic British sci-fi\n  * If we\u2019re going to rank the hottest video game characters, let\u2019s not be boring about it | Amelia Tait\n  * Expelled! \u2013 turning the tables on the private school class hierarchy | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n  * Two Point Museum \u2013 curate your own fun in this museum management game | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\n## Question Block\nReader **Robin** provides this week\u2019s question:\n_\u201c_ _Here\u2019s a question I can\u2019t get out of my head: how can you play Monster Hunter!? I\u2019m not squeamish at all but I could barely get through a training session, which involved hurting a harmless creature trapped in an arena \u2026 I was disgusted and my son was horrified. Then some innocent creature lay dying and I was pulling silly faces and taking photos of the poor thing as it breathed its last.__And if Monster Hunter didn\u2019t do it for you, what has prompted you to walk away from a game?\u201d_\nThis is such a valid question! I was vegetarian for 12 years and yet throughout, I happily cut down majestic creatures in **Monster Hunter** and felt proud of my achievements. I am so fascinated by this dichotomy that I wrote a whole article about it when Monster Hunter: World came out in 2018. Forgive me for quoting myself, but here\u2019s what I wrote:\n> One of the functions of fantasy violence, whether in Monster Hunter or Game of Thrones, is to prompt reflection on the role that violence plays in the real world and in human nature. Monster Hunter might involve killing, but it also restores humans to the hierarchy of the natural world \u2026 Perhaps spending hours of my leisure time pretending to be a hunter-gatherer-warrior is an outlet for the slavering carnivore within.\nI am not vegetarian any more, but I fully acknowledge the dissonance between respecting and admiring these incredible virtual creatures and then killing them to make fancy helmets. The latest game does a lot of cognitive somersaulting in its story to try to make out that killing these dangerous beasts is noble because we do it to protect people and the ecosystem. But on a base level, we\u2019re doing it because it\u2019s fun, and that _is_ pretty gross on one level. On another: it\u2019s fantasy. With absolutely no judgment towards fans of first-person shooters, I am personally more comfortable with killing virtual dragons than killing virtual people.\nOn to the second part of your question: one moment in **Grand Theft Auto V** made me so uncomfortable that I had to fetch my partner to play through the scene for me. A scene in the story that involves a hillbilly psycho capturing and torturing a guy who is Middle Eastern. You have no choice but to actively participate, and it made me feel nauseated. It\u2019s obviously intended to be satirical commentary on the US government\u2019s immediate recourse to torture after 9/11, but it massively missed the mark for me.\n_If you\u2019ve got a question for Question Block \u2013 or anything else to say about the newsletter \u2013 hit reply or email us on ._\nExplore more on these topics\n  * Games\n  * Pushing Buttons newsletter\n  * Awards and prizes\n  * features\n\n\nReuse this content\n## Most", "title": "Bafta's gaming awards celebrate Britain's creative diversity with Hellblade II leading nominations, indie titles competing alongside major releases, and games exploring themes like mental health and environmentalism.", "summary": "The Bafta games awards nominations offer a welcome respite from the doom of current times, showcasing the creative vivacity of the video game industry.

Plus, the underlying AMZN stock has become overbought at $240 with over-extensions on relative strength (RSI), MACD and Williams\u2019 %R. So, we\u2019d suggest sitting on the sidelines with Amazon until it sees a healthy pullback.\n## **Amazon Crushed Third Quarter Numbers**\nWhile we wait for its latest earnings report, let\u2019s take a quick look at the third quarter.\nAmazon\u2019s EPS OF $1.43 beat by 29 cents. Revenue of $158.88 billion, up 11% year over year, beat by $1.6 billion. AWS segment sales jumped 19% year over year to $27.5 billion. Operating cash flow increased 57% to $112.7 billion from $71.7 billion year over year. And its free cash flow of $47.7 billion soared from $21.4 billion a year earlier.\nMoving forward, the company\u2019s net sales are expected to come in between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, as compared to estimates of $188.26 billion. Operating income is expected to come in between $16 billion and $20 billion, as compared to estimates for $13.2 billion.\nAnalysts expect Amazon to have earned $1.48 a share in the fourth quarter, which would be about 48% year-over-year growth. Revenue is expected to land at $187.3 billion, which would be 10% year over year.\n## **But Wait, There\u2019s More\u2026******\nLong-term, there\u2019s a lot to like about Amazon.\nFor one, e-commerce continues to grow with Amazon now holding 40% market share. That\u2019s massive when you compare it to Walmart\u2019s (NYSE:WMT) 7%. Two, Statista says that the U.S. e-commerce market could be worth about $1.9 trillion in the coming years.\nThree, ad revenue is also on the run. In its third quarter, the company\u2019s ad revenue jumped 19% to $14.3 billion. It\u2019s even grabbing a bigger piece of the U.S. digital ad market. eMarketer, for example, says ad sales could reach $95 billion.\nWe also have to consider that AI cloud computing has big potential. Amazon holds a 31% market share. Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google has 12%. Plus, companies are spending more on the AI cloud, with Goldman Sachs estimating that global computing sales will reach $2 trillion by 2030.\nAgain, there\u2019s plenty to like about Amazon in the long term.\nShort-term, we would wait for the AMZN stock to pull back from overbought conditions.\nThe post Institutions Just Bet $2.6 Million on Amazon Upside appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "title": "Institutional investments in Amazon's long-term call options reflect confidence in its e-commerce dominance and AI cloud growth potential amid Goldman Sachs' $2 trillion market forecast.", "summary": "Institutional investors have placed significant bets on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) upside, purchasing $1.33 million and $1.31 million worth of March 21, 2025 call options.

When paired with an olive drab NATO strap, there is a complementary contrast rather than a boring blending. \nThe new Khaki Green shines most when paired with the Khaki Field Quatz\u2019s new three-link, aka oyster-style, steel bracelet. It is finished with the same micro-blasted texture as the case, creating a matte frame that enhances the soft green hue. \n## A legendary bargain\nHamilton\u2019s Khaki Field dial is a delicate subject revered in certain horological circles. Every detail is iconic and has been copied by other brands many times over. \nHamilton smartly stuck to its own design history when revamping the Khaki Field Quartz dial.Hamilton\nMinor changes have been made over the past three-quarters of a century, but nothing this significant.

If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission. Learn more\nBefore the Ace were released last summer, I remember there being all kinds of rumors surrounding Sonos\u2019s first-ever headphones. Many speculated that, similar to their most recent speakers, they\u2019d support both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi streaming \u2026 which would\u2019ve been awesome for two reasons.\nFirst, it would allow the headphones to be grouped with other Sonos speakers in your home. More interestingly, it would have allowed the Ace headphones to stream music over Wi-Fi and thus play much higher-resolution tracks. Wi-Fi can support much higher bitrates than Bluetooth, after all.\nBut alas, the Sonos Ace came out and only ended up supporting Bluetooth streaming, similar to every other pair of wireless headphones and earbuds out there. And I have to admit, it was a little bit of a bummer. \nFast forward to the present, however, and a new pair of wireless earbuds could deliver on a promise that many hoped Sonos would deliver.\nXiaomi\u2019s wireless earbuds represent a new breed of wireless earbuds that support streaming over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.Xiaomi\n## The next frontier for wireless headphones?\nAt Mobile World Congress (MWC), the world\u2019s biggest annual trade show for smartphones, Xiaomi revealed the Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi. They are the first wireless earbuds to feature Qualcomm\u2019s S7 Pro chip, which allows them to stream audio over either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.\nWhen at home and your smartphone is connected to Wi-Fi, the earbuds can play lossless audio up to 24-bit/96kHz with a transmission rate of up to 4.2 Mbps. \nThis is significantly better than what Bluetooth \u2014 including high-res codecs like aptX Adaptive (up to 420 kbps), aptX HD (up to 576 kbps), LDAC (up to 990 kbps), and aptX Lossless (1,411 kbps) \u2014 can deliver. \nThen, when you leave the house and its Wi-Fi network, the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi wireless earbuds will default back to streaming over Bluetooth. (They support aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless.)\nWhen connected to Wi-Fi, they support high-resolution audio up to 24-bit/96kHz with a transmission rate of up to 4.2 Mbps.Xiaomi\n## Wait, what\u2019s the catch?\nOf course, there are a few (big) caveats regarding Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi. The biggest hurdle you\u2019ll face is that you need to have a compatible smartphone. \nIn order to play high-resolution audio over Wi-Fi, you\u2019ll need to pair the wireless earbuds with a smartphone equipped with Qualcomm\u2019s flagship processor. Currently, only Xiaomi\u2019s smartphones, the Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Ultra, check that box. \nAlso, the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi have only launched in Europe and there\u2019s no telling if they\u2019ll ever be released in the States. Since Xiaomi doesn\u2019t typically sell its smartphones in the US, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for these earbuds to come anytime soon, either.\nFor those who do have a Xiaomi smartphone and are able to get their hands on the Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi, you\u2019ll obviously have to subscribe to a lossless streaming service to enjoy the full high-res audio quality, too.\nUnfortunately, the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi aren\u2019t quite ready for the iPhone-wielding masses.Xiaomi\nObviously, this means that the vast majority of iPhone-wielding people in the States won\u2019t have access to these new earbuds or their new resolution streaming capabilities. But it\u2019s still promising that such technologies are being worked on. \nThat said, Apple continues to improve its AirPods line with impressive new capabilities \u2014 most recently, turning the Pros into bonafide hearing aids \u2014 so I wouldn\u2019t abandon hope that it could eventually release a pair that supports Wi-Fi streaming as well. \n_The Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi cost \u00a3190 (around $240), making them pretty competitively priced compared to other flagship noise-canceling wireless earbuds._\nXiaomi\n### Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi\n  * $240 at Xiaomi", "title": "Xiaomi's Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi earbuds introduce Wi-Fi streaming for high-resolution audio via Qualcomm's S7 Pro chip, but require specific Xiaomi smartphones and are currently limited to European markets.", "summary": "Xiaomi's Buds 5 Pro Wi-Fi earbuds deliver a long-awaited feature: streaming over both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, enabling higher-resolution audio playback.

By the time the death knell tolled, the video chatting software that once revolutionized communications had become a ghost of its former self. Experts chimed in with half-hearted eulogies for the platform that Microsoft spent years neglecting, yet few were surprised, and even fewer shed tears.\n\u201cThe fact that Skype was never integrated into any other Microsoft platform, nor redesigned to resemble other Microsoft solutions or included in any bundled commercial offerings \u2013 despite its loss of users \u2013 was a clear indication that Microsoft had long decided to discontinue the service,\u201d said Gianvito Lanzolla, a professor of strategy, atUniversity of London.\nBut for Skype\u2019s long-suffering users, and those who stopped using it but still thought of it fondly, the coming demise of Skype \u2013 which will shut down on 5 May \u2013 is a moment worthy of acknowledgment. Skype was a reminder of a bygone era and a source of inspiration for many. It facilitated relationships across oceans when there were few affordable means of making international calls, nothing short of a miracle for those with family members in distant parts of the world.\nOne nostalgic Guardian reader composed a song based on the familiar Skype ring. Michael Frishkopf, a professor at the University of Albert\u2019s department of music and the director of the Canadian Centre for Ethnomusicology, created a short symphonic work with the Skype theme song in 2020. It was \u201coriginally for a film score (though it was never used in that way)\u201d, Frishkopf wrote in an email.\n\u201cSkype was always a tool for connecting out of isolation and it struck me that a lot of people probably associate it with being far from loved ones,\u201d Frishkopf said. \u201cThat Skype ring tone, I don\u2019t know who made it, but it has a kind of wistfulness to it. It isn\u2019t either major or minor, it could go either way. In the same way, it could sound happy or sad which could represent the sadness of longing for someone and the joy of connecting with them. That [Skype] is fading out for good, it might cause a sense of loss for people.\u201d\nInspired by Frishkopf\u2019s email, the Guardian asked readers to share their own memories of Skype. What they described in touching tributes was a piece of technology that connected parents with their children, enabled start-up founders to communicate across oceans and timezones, and even made two proposals possible.\n## The stay-at-home mom who found a new career\nWhen I had a mid-career shift, I used Skype extensively as a way to contact clients. That was 2019, and I was on the verge of working again. I spent ten years as a full-time mom, you see. Before I began working online, it felt impossible to be working and stay at home for my kids. You can say that Skype opened up a world of possibilities to me.**Melany Heger, Manila, Philippines**\n## The couples who dated and proposed on Skype\nI proposed to my Swedish husband over Skype using sticky notes. We got married on 5 May 2015, the same day Skype will end its service. It\u2019s very sad, I especially liked it since it was from my husband\u2019s homeland of Sweden. Skype played a big part in our lives in keeping us connected while we were dating and it will always be in my heart.**Holly, Iowa**\nI think we take for granted how revolutionary Skype was. A futurist utopia always included video calling, and that was ubiquitous by 2005 thanks to Skype. I proposed marriage through it to a long-distance girlfriend in 2008. We never got married, but our ill-fated engagement felt glorious for the weeks after, and memories of our multi-hour sessions still give me a sense of melancholy as strong as any other moments of lost young love.**Dave, Michigan**\nMy husband and I would never be married if we hadn\u2019t had Skype. We met in 2004 when he was on a year abroad from Colorado School of Mines to the University of Leeds. By the time I moved to the States and we got married in November 2009, we had racked up countless Skype hours at all times of the day and night. Skype allowed us to have a long distance relationship that would not have seemed possible if we were just a few years older. Skype also allowed me to see and chat with my parents after I had moved.\nNowadays my children (11 and seven) cannot imagine a life without FaceTiming their grandparents, but so much of that is owed to mom and dad\u2019s early years of Skype dating!**Jessica,****Colorado**\n## The faraway relatives who Skyped family back home\nIn 2004, I moved across the world to attend university in the United States. Phone calls were too expensive, so I would spend hours on Skype chatting with my family and friends back home. When we went around the dinner table saying what we were grateful for my first American Thanksgiving, Skype was my answer. Homesickness was my malady, Skype was my medicine.**Laura, Los Angeles**\nMy great-grandmother said the most important invention during her lifetime was the ability to fly internationally, delighting in the fact that she could journey from Australia by plane for her one and only \u2018grand European tour\u2019 in the 1960s, once all her children had grown. For my grandmother, who sadly passed in 2010, it was the invention of Skype. She had spent many years corresponding via a much-cherished weekly letter and annual phone call when her only sister moved to London and then New York during the 60s and 70s. So, you can imagine her delight when I made a similar move abroad in the 2000s that we could still see each other and talk via a video call during her final years. I cherish the memory of those Skype calls as much as the letters she wrote me.**Felix, Mexico**\nWhen first arriving on these Japanese shores, calls to the US were prohibitively expensive. I used to write aerograms (light paper that could be folded into an envelope) to my parents. Then I had two children who dispersed, one to Tokyo, one to the US. We Skype regularly, though we also use Google Chat. As an expat, I have found Skype invaluable. It can be used as a verb \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s Skype!\u201d \u2013 and fulfills a sense of joy found on Christmas morning. I will miss it.**William Baerg, Japan**\nWe are still using Skype on a weekly basis to talk to my husband\u2019s Nanna, who is in her 90s. We started doing this in Covid and haven\u2019t stopped \u2013 Tuesday evening is family chat time. She gets to see her two great granddaughters this way. We think we can switch to Zoom but it\u2019s more awkward for her to use.**Alice, Hampshire**\nThroughout his numerous 12-15 month military deployments that dotted my childhood, Skype (and later Skype-to-Go) was the most reliable way to have any sort of contact with my dad in between receiving hand written letters.**Veronica, Michigan**\n## The teachers who used Skype to reach their students\nI have been teaching Qur\u2019an on Skype for the last nine years. I think there is no better app for teaching, especially because of the clarity of the voice in terms of teaching by sharing the page.**Ghulam Asghar Awan, Pakistan**\nDuring the pandemic, I did online teaching via Skype. One of my students was a single child, alone at home. She was around 10 when I first taught her. Now when all school was online, she was obviously very happy to have a teacher just for herself. She didn\u2019t learn much, because she interrupted me all the time, just wanting to talk to somebody. Bella, you still have a very special place in my heart! I\u2019ll never forget you!**Friedrich Helmke, Brazil**\n## The friends who connected via Skype\nThe person with whom I used Skype the most and used it last was my friend Harald. I live in Wisconsin and work at the university in Madison. Harald was from Germany but did a postdoctoral fellowship in Madison in the early 2000s. We became friends while he was here, and interestingly, we grew much closer after he moved back to Germany. We would get together before or after conferences and do bike trips together, and we visited each other many times over the years.\nHarald\u2019s preferred way of communicating when we were on opposite sides of the world was by Skype. He\u2019d use it as a verb. \u201cLet\u2019s Skype next Tuesday,\u201d he\u2019d say to me. I would often tease him as new platforms became popular that he was wedded to this outdated mode of communication. He died about two years ago, and I miss him terribly. And anytime I hear about Skype I think of him.**Matthew,****W****isconsin**\n## The startup founders who met every evening on Skype\nOur startup, which has helped hundreds of thousands of people access scientific research, only exists because of Skype. We wrote the seeds of the project at an all-night hackathon in 2011, in person, but the two of us lived in different countries and three time zones apart \u2013 would this thing fizzle or bloom? Over the next few years we talked on Skype every evening to improve the product, get funded, incorporate and grow. Skype saw our grit, tears and laughter. The result was Unpaywall, , improved open science, and wonderful memories.

Estas interferencias, ya sean de una fuente externa o de los propios equipos de la aeronave, pueden alterar las se\u00f1ales electr\u00f3nicas que controlan los sistemas cr\u00edticos \u2013 similar a los efectos que produce la est\u00e1tica en un radio de un aparato emisor cercano, como un tel\u00e9fono. \nLas pruebas, realizadas en las instalaciones del contratista Lockheed Martin Skunk Works en Palmdale, California, garantizaron que los sistemas de a bordo del X-59 \u2013 como radios, equipos de navegaci\u00f3n y sensores \u2013 no interfirieran entre s\u00ed ni causaran problemas inesperados. Durante estas pruebas, los ingenieros activaron cada sistema de la aeronave uno a la vez mientras monitoreaba los otros sistemas para detectar posibles interferencias.\nEl avi\u00f3n supers\u00f3nico silencioso de investigaci\u00f3n X-59 de la NASA ha superado con \u00e9xito las pruebas de interferencia electromagn\u00e9tica (EMI, por su acr\u00f3nimo ingles) en Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, en Palmdale (California). Durante las pruebas EMI, el equipo examin\u00f3 cada uno de los sistemas electr\u00f3nicos internos del X-59, asegur\u00e1ndose de que funcionaban entre s\u00ed sin interferencias.

Actualmente, la aeronave est\u00e1 siendo sometida a pruebas en tierra para garantizar su seguridad y rendimiento. Recientemente se han completado con \u00e9xito una serie de pruebas de motor. Las pruebas de interferencias electromagn\u00e9ticas para examinar los sistemas electr\u00f3nicos internos del X-59 siguieron. \nEn otras pruebas de interferencias electromagn\u00e9ticas, el equipo examin\u00f3 el funcionamiento del tren de aterrizaje del X-59, asegur\u00e1ndose de que este componente cr\u00edtico puede extenderse y retraerse sin afectar a otros sistemas. Tambi\u00e9n probaron que el cierre de interruptor de combustible funcionara correctamente sin interferencias. \nDurante estas pruebas tambi\u00e9n se evalu\u00f3 la compatibilidad electromagn\u00e9tica, para garantizar que los sistemas del X-59 funcionen correctamente cuando eventualmente vuele cerca de aviones de investigaci\u00f3n de la NASA. \nEl piloto de pruebas de la NASA Jim Less se prepara para salir de la cabina del silencioso avi\u00f3n supers\u00f3nico X-59 entre las pruebas de interferencia electromagn\u00e9tica (EMI).

Around Earth, a single magnetic reconnection event can release as much energy in a couple of hours as the entire United States uses in a day.\nOver the past 10 years, thousands of research papers with discoveries by MMS have enabled a wide range of technical and scientific advances, such as those about the conditions on the Sun that create space weather, which can impact technology and communications at Earth. It has also enabled insights for fusion energy technologies.\n\u201cThe MMS mission has been a very important asset in NASA\u2019s heliophysics fleet observatory,\u201d said Guan Le, MMS mission lead at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \u201cIt has utterly changed how we understand magnetic reconnection.\u201d\nAn infographic listing MMS\u2019 accomplishments after 10 years in space.\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center/Kristen Perrin\nStudying magnetic reconnection is key to understanding where this energy goes and how it can affect us down on the ground.\n\u201cThe MMS mission not only studies universal physical processes, but it also allows us to probe the mechanisms that connect big eruptions on the Sun to things we experience on Earth, such as auroras, geomagnetic storms, and even power outages in extreme cases,\u201d said Kevin Genestreti, MMS science deputy principal investigator and lead scientist at Southwest Research Institute\u2019s Space Sector in Durham, New Hampshire.\n### **_The Perfect Laboratory_**\nUsing four identical spacecraft, MMS studies magnetic reconnection while traveling in a long, oval-shaped orbit around Earth \u2014 a perfect laboratory for closely studying magnetic reconnection.\n\u201cYou can measure reconnection in a laboratory, but the scales are so very small there that you can\u2019t make the detailed measurements needed to really understand reconnection,\u201d said Jim Burch, principal investigator for MMS at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas.\nMagnetic reconnection primarily happens in two locations around Earth, one located on the side facing the Sun, and another behind Earth farther away from the Sun. In their orbit, the four MMS spacecraft repeatedly pass through these key locations.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that  \nsupports HTML5 video\nThis artist\u2019s concept shows magnetic reconnection at Earth during a solar storm.\nNASA Goddard\u2019s Conceptual Image Lab/Krystofer Kim\nBefore MMS, scientists only had a limited understanding of magnetic reconnection. But by improving instrument measurement speeds tenfold, MMS has been able to dramatically reshape what we know about the process. To date, MMS data has led to over 1,500 published scientific articles.\n\u201cFor example, it turned out that the basic theory of reconnection in turbulent regions was wrong because previous missions couldn\u2019t make observations at the level MMS can,\u201d Burch said. \u201cWe also found reconnection in a lot of places that weren\u2019t predicted.\u201d\nWorking out new and refined theories of magnetic reconnection was an integral part of the MMS mission from the outset. \n\u201cOne of the truly groundbreaking findings from MMS is that the heart of reconnection has a well-ordered beat \u2013 even if everything around is turbulent,\u201d said Michael Hesse, MMS theory and modeling lead at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California\u2019s Silicon Valley. \u201cThis shows that precision measurement can decide between competing theories.\u201d\n### **_Enabling Breakthroughs for Science and Scientists_**\nThe mission\u2019s successes have also been a boon to young scientists, who are closely involved with the mission at all levels.\n\u201cIn addition to its scientific achievements, it has also helped almost 50 students get doctorate degrees and enabled early career scientists to grow into leadership positions,\u201d Le said.\nTo foster young scientists, MMS provides early career research grants to team members. The MMS team also created \u201cLeads In-Training\u201d roles to bring early career scientists to the table for big mission decisions and provide them the experience they need to move into leadership positions. The program has been so successful it is now required for all NASA Heliophysics missions.\n### **_Breaking Records_**\nBeyond its scientific achievements, MMS also holds several records. Only months after launch, MMS received its first Guinness World Record for highest GPS fix at 44,000 miles above Earth. It would later shatter this record as it moved into a longer orbit, taking it 116,300 miles \u2014 halfway to the Moon \u2014 away from GPS transponders at Earth. GPS is designed to send signals down toward Earth, so using it in space, where signals are weak, is challenging. By using GPS at high altitudes, MMS has shown its potential for other applications.\n\u201cThis GPS demonstration has been of great interest for the developers of the Artemis missions, which is testing GPS at lunar distances,\u201d said Jim Clapsadle, MMS mission director at NASA Goddard.\nThe mission also holds the Guinness World Record for smallest satellite formation, with just 2.6 miles between spacecraft. Over the years, MMS\u2019 four spacecraft have flown in lines and pyramid-shaped formations from 5 to 100 miles across to help scientists study magnetic reconnection on a range of scales. In that time, the spacecraft\u2019s health has remained remarkably well.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that  \nsupports HTML5 video\nThis artist\u2019s concept beauty pass shows the MMS spacecraft flying on Earth\u2019s nightside, where MMS continues to study magnetic reconnection.\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab\n\u201cThe hardware has proved very reliable, even now, 10 years into flight,\u201d said Trevor Williams, MMS flight dynamics lead at NASA Goddard.\nAfter launch, Williams and the flight operations team came up with more fuel-efficient ways to maneuver the spacecraft and keep them at their designated separations. As a result, the mission still has about a fourth of the fuel it launched with. This economy leaves enough fuel to continue operating the mission for decades. That\u2019s good news to mission scientists who are eager to continue studying magnetic reconnection with MMS.\n\u201cWe have thousands of magnetic reconnection events on the day side, but far fewer on the nightside,\u201d Burch said. \u201cBut over the next three years we\u2019ll be in a prime location to finish investigating nightside reconnection.\u201d\n_**By****Mara Johnson-Groh**  \n**NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.**_\n**Media Contact:Sarah Frazier**\n## Share\n  *   \n  \n\n  *   \n  \n\n  *   \n  \n\n  *   \n  \n\n\n\n## Details\nLast Updated\nMar 12, 2025\nEditor\nMiles Hatfield\nContact\nMara Johnson-Groh\nLocation\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n## Related Terms\n  * Heliophysics\n  * Earth's Magnetic Field\n  * Goddard Space Flight Center\n  * Science & Research\n\n\n## Explore More\n27 min read\n### Summary of Special Engage Session on \u201cRemote Sensing and the Future of Earth Observations\u201d\n  \n  \nArticle  \n  \n  \n1 day ago \n4 min read\n### Discovery Alert: \u2018Super-Earth\u2019 Swings from Super-Heated to Super-Chill\n  \n  \nArticle  \n  \n  \n1 day ago \n6 min read\n### NASA\u2019s Webb Peers Deeper into Mysterious Flame Nebula\n  \n  \nArticle  \n  \n  \n2 days ago \nKeep Exploring\n## Discover More Topics From NASA\nMissions  \n\n  \n\nHumans in Space  \n\n  \n\nClimate Change  \n\n  \n\nSolar System", "title": "NASA's MMS mission has fundamentally transformed understanding of magnetic reconnection, enabling over 1,500 studies and breaking records in space technology through its advanced observations and applications like GPS at lunar distances.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission has revolutionized the understanding of magnetic reconnection, a crucial process occurring across the universe, since its launch on March 12, 2015.

This suggests that traditional cash users may be seeking digital alternatives for their transactions, particularly in e-commerce settings.\nAdoption sentiment remains mixed across Europe, with one-third of respondents expressing willingness to use the digital euro, though many indicate they would do so infrequently. The survey found notably lower interest in non-eurozone countries like Sweden and Denmark, where only 25% would consider using a CBDC.\nPrivacy concerns emerged as a critical factor shaping public trust. Commercial banks emerged as the most trusted institutions for handling digital euro data at 42%, while **BigTech** companies received only 5% trust ratings. Notably, 32% of Europeans expressed distrust in any organization handling their CBDC-related personal data.\nThe trust gap between commercial and central banks proves particularly striking in eurozone countries, where commercial banks lead central banks by nearly 30 percentage points. This gap narrows to 13% in non-eurozone countries (Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland), suggesting different institutional dynamics outside the euro area.\nWhen asked about preferred features, respondents prioritized free usage (43%) and universal acceptance (37%). While usability didn\u2019t top the list of concerns, the survey implies that user-friendly implementation will be crucial for widespread adoption.\nContrary to popular perception about the decline of cash, the survey revealed surprising resilience in physical currency usage.

Wide-bandgap materials also allow for smaller, faster, more reliable, and more energy-efficient power electronic components than current commercial silicon-based power electronic components.\nResearchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Colorado School of Mines, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory examined a potential route to achieve peak performance of aluminum gallium nitride, AlxGa1-xN, a key material for increasing power electronics' energy efficiency and performance, through growth on optimized substrate materials.\nThe goal of the work is to grow higher-quality materials through the selection of a lattice-matched substrate. Better electron transmission means better device performance, but the growth of AlxGa1-xN on lattice-mismatched substrates leads to dislocation (line defects that distort a lattice due to the misalignment of atoms), resulting in diminished performance.\n\"Substrate engineering enables the use of high-performing materials in real devices,\" said NREL's Dennice Roberts, a materials science researcher. \"If we can engineer lattice-matched substrates to reduce the effect of dislocations, we can widen the range of sufficiently high-quality materials and build better, more energy-efficient power electronics.\"\nAs detailed in a new paper, \"Designing TaC Virtual Substrates for Vertical AlxGa1\u2212xN Power Electronics Devices,\" in _PRX Energy_ , the research team proposed and demonstrated that electrically conductive, lattice-matched tantalum carbide (TaC) can act as a suitable substrate for AlxGa1-xN epitaxy that may meet growing power needs.\n## Benefits of transition metal carbides for AlxGa1-xN growth\nSubstrate engineering can improve device performance\u2014but it is complicated. Defects, such as substrate cracking, are common with growth on AlN and GaN. Efforts to reduce dislocation have been effective but often increase device complexity and limit device design and performance. Lattice mismatching, again, leads to device performance issues.\n\"Lattice matching is critical for high-quality epitaxial growth,\" Roberts said. \"We hypothesized that substrates from transition metal carbide and nitride families could enable desired conditions for AlxGa1-xN growth, not only because of ideal lattice matching but also because of ideal thermal and electrical conductivity properties. TaC and AlxGa1-xN are closely lattice-matched, TaC is highly conductive, and they display matched growth in size in response to changes in temperature.\"\nThe team grew, prepared, and used TaC thin films as virtual substrates for high-aluminum-content AlxGa1-xN and demonstrated AlxGa1-xN growth on TaC virtual substrates. To precisely and effectively deposit TaC onto the substrate, they used radio frequency sputtering. They formed substrates through high-temperature annealing, a process that increases ductility\u2014the ability of a metal to undergo significant stress before cracking or breaking\u2014and reduces defects.\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over **100,000 subscribers** who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

The broader context of this study is that lattice-matched substrates with the same crystal structure are often unavailable. Therefore, there are new opportunities to use heterostructural interfaces for conversion and control, if the formation of these more complex interfaces can be understood and controlled.\nThe formation of interfaces between rocksalt structure (rs) and wurtzite structure (wz) materials\u2014e.g., between TaC and AlN (GaN) films\u2014can be modeled by considering the different possibilities of stacking the individual atomic layers. This problem is somewhat related to the question of how to arrange oranges in a box so as to get as many as possible into it.\nThe NREL researchers approached this problem by writing a computer code with an algorithm to systematically enumerate the possible stacking sequences within a few atomic layers near the interface. This algorithm can be used to understand the atomic structures of various commensurate rs/wz interfaces, including the oxide interfaces.\nMahatara and Lany then used first-principles density functional theory calculations to determine the most energetically stable atomic structure arrangement for each combination of substrate termination (the type of the last substrate atomic layer, Ta or C), film nucleation (the first nitride film layer, Al/Ga or N), and wz polarity (Al/Ga or N polarity, describing the orientation of the atomic bonds).\nAdditionally, they used this data to predict which of the combinations will be most favorable under different experimental synthesis conditions. This information is important because the detailed atomic structure at the interface will determine the material's functionality and performance in a device.\nFor example, the polarity affects electric fields that are responsible for the transport of electrons across the interface. Controlling the polarity of the film during growth is therefore an important aspect of AlGaN epitaxy.\n\"Our results may guide experimentalists on how to regulate nitrogen-polarity against metal-polarity of nitride films grown on TaC substrates as a function of growth conditions,\" Mahatara said.\nAs a follow-up to the current work, Mahatara and Lany are now investigating the electronic properties of their predicted structures. This ongoing effort will provide further information and predictions on how these structures will act and perform in new device concepts. The goal is to give experimentalists critical data for rational device design to accelerate the development of novel concepts in microelectronics.\nThe findings from both studies may inform substrate engineering that improves power electronics as the needs of an electrified future grow.\n\"We're excited about the potential for these materials to address power and energy efficiency challenges,\" Roberts said. \"From a research perspective, it's really neat to see a creative solution to a longstanding problem look like it has a lot of promise in real world applications, so we look forward to the developments to come.\"\n**More information:** Dennice M.

The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.\nWhen an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.\nAll this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.\nIn December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.\nFilm distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.\nHowever, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.\nIn the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.\n## 'People don't have the money'\nSushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.\n\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"\nShe said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.\n\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.\nChris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.\n\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.\n\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"\nFollowing the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.\n\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.\nReeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".\nShe also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts. \nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK. \n\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the chancellor's Budget was to blame for \"pitiful economic growth\".\n\"Her complete pig's ear of a jobs tax will hammer small businesses, the backbone of our economy.\"\n_Additional reporting by Peter Ruddick_\nEconomics\nPersonal finance\nGDP\nUK economy", "title": "UK economic growth of 0.1% in late 2024, driven by construction and services, faces headwinds from tax hikes and cost pressures, with Rachel Reeves's policies drawing criticism for stifling business investment and consumer spending.", "summary": "The UK economy grew by 0.1% in the final quarter of 2024, defying analyst predictions of a contraction, driven by strong performances in construction and services sectors, including pubs, bars, and machinery manufacturers.\n\n* Key growth drivers: \n\n\t+ Construction sector boost from new private housing projects\n\n\t+ Services sector growth, including film distribution and machinery manufacturing\n\n\t+ December alone saw a 0.4% economic growth estimate\n\n* Contrasting indicators: \n\n\t+ Living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared to the previous year (real GDP per head)\n\n\t+ Weak trade months for computer programming, publishing, and car sales businesses\n\n**Concerns Over Future Growth**\n\nBusinesses warn of potential sluggish growth due to upcoming tax rises, National Insurance increases, and reduced business rates relief.

However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals.\nThe interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.\nAbout 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.\nThat means a higher monthly bill for many homeowners on their next renewal, but there are signs that the rate they could pay is on its way down.\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the interest-rate setting committee expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\". \nThis will affect savers who are seeing lower returns, but could bring better news for borrowers. The Bank's next rates decision is on 20 March.\nThe markets and lenders are expecting more base rate cuts this year, seen through so-called swap rates. So, rates for new fixed mortgage deals are predicted to fall - especially as mortgage providers tend to move as a pack.\n\"It was only a matter of time for lenders to bring back sub-4% mortgages,\" said Rachel Springall, from financial information service Moneyfacts.\n\"This is a positive injection to the mortgage market and when a big lender makes such a move, it can prompt its peers to follow suit with cuts of their own.\n\"The millions of mortgage borrowers looking to refinance this year need some good news.\"\n## Read the small print\nEligible borrowers for the sub-4% rates will need a 40% deposit, which will shut off these deals to many borrowers, especially some first-time buyers.\nThey may also have a relatively large fee, so borrowers will need to check whether the overall value works for them.\nMore demand for homes from buyers could be generated if mortgage rates fall for a prolonged period.\nIn its latest survey, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said that housing market activity was expected to pick up over the coming months following a flat start to the year.\nSeparate figures show landlords have been feeling the pressure from relatively high mortgage rates.\nRepossessions of properties from landlords in England and Wales hit another record high last year, .\nBoth repossession claims - the start of the process - and actual repossessions rose in the final quarter of the year, with cases concentrated in London.\nThat, in turn, could create problems for availability for tenants if these homes are lost to the rental sector.\n## Ways to make your mortgage more affordable\n  * Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later.\n  * Move to an interest-only mortgage. It can keep your monthly payments affordable although you won't be paying off the debt accrued when purchasing your house.\n  * Extend the life of your mortgage.

It might naturally be supposed that the founder of so remarkable a monument of architectural skill would be well known; yet while Strabo and Pliny, Eusebius, Suidas, and Lucian ascribe its erection to Ptolem\u00e6us Philadelphus, the wisest and most benevolent of the Ptolemean kings of Egypt, by Tzetzes and Ammianus Marcellinus the honour is given to Cleopatra; _and other authorities even attribute it to Alexander the Great._\nAll that can with certainty be affirmed is, that the architect was named Sostrates. Montfaucon, in his great work, endeavours to explain how it is that while we are thus informed as to the architect, we are so doubtful as to the founder, whom, for his part, he believes to have been Ptolem\u00e6us. Our ignorance, he says, is owing to the knavery of Sostrates. He wished to immortalize his name; a blameless wish, if at the same time he had not sought to suppress that of the founder, whose glory it was to have suggested the erection. For this purpose Sostrates devised a stratagem which proved successful; deep in the wall of the tower he cut the following inscription: \u201cSostrates of Cnidos, son of Dexiphanes, to the gods who Protect those who are upon the Sea.\u201d But, mistrustful that King Ptolem\u00e6us would scarcely be satisfied with an inscription in which he was wholly ignored, he covered it with a light coat of cement, which he knew would not long endure the action of the atmosphere, and carved thereon the name of Ptolem\u00e6us. After a few years the cement and the name of the king disappeared, and revealed the inscription which gave all the glory to Sostrates. \nMontfaucon, with genial credulity, adopts this anecdote as authentic, and adds: Pliny pretends that Ptolem\u00e6us, out of the modesty and greatness of his soul, desired the architect\u2019s name to be engraved upon the tower, and no reference to himself to be made. But this statement is very dubious; it would have passed as incredible in those times, and even to-day would be regarded as an ill-understood act of magnanimity. We have never heard of any prince prohibiting the perpetuation of his name upon magnificent works designed for the public utility, or being content that the architect should usurp the entire honour. \nTo solve the difficulty, Champollion represents the pharos as constructed by Ptolem\u00e6us Soter. But, as Edrisi solemnly remarks, \u201cGod alone knows what is the truth.\u201d \nMuch etymological erudition has been expended on the derivation of the word Pharos. As far as the Alexandrian light-tower is concerned, there can be no doubt that it was named from the islet on which it stood; yet Isidore asserts that the word came from \u03c6\u1f7c\u03c2, \u201clight,\u201d and \u1f41\u03c1\u1f00\u03bd, \u201cto see.\u201d To quote again from Montfaucon: _That numerous persons, who have not read the Greek authors, should exercise their ingenuity to no avail in the extraction of these etymologies, is far less surprising than that so good a scholar as Isaac Vossius should seek the origin of Pharos in the Greek language._ From \u03d5\u03b1\u1f30\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u201cto shine,\u201d he says, comes \u03d5\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, and from \u03d5\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u03d5\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2.... But the island was called Pharos seven or eight hundred years before it possessed either tower or beacon-light. \nThe most reasonable conjecture seems to be that the word is a Hellenic form of Phrah, the Egyptian name of the sun, to whom the Alexandrian lighthouse would naturally be compared by wondering spectators, or dedicated by a devout prince. \nAt a later date we find the word applied to very different objects, though always retaining the signification of light or brilliancy. A pharos of fire\u2014i.e., a ball or meteor\u2014was seen, says Gregory of Tours, to issue from the church of St. Hilaire, and descend upon King Clovis. The same historian uses the word to describe a conflagration:\u2014\u201cThey (the barbarians) set fire to the church of St. Hilaire, kindled a great pharos, and while the church was burning, pillaged the monastery.\u201d The old French historian frequently employs the word in this sense, which leads us to suppose that in his time an incendiary was probably designated \u201ca maker of pharoses\u201d (un faiseur de phares). Still later, the term pharos was applied to certain machines in which a number of lamps or tapers were placed, as in a candelabrum. A modern French writer quotes from Anastasius the Librarian, that Pope Sylvester caused \u201ca pharos of pure gold\u201d to be constructed; and that Pope Adrian I. made one, \u201cin the form of a cross,\u201d capable of receiving one hundred and seventy candles or tapers. And Leon of Ostia, in his \u201cChronicle of Monte Cassino,\u201d says, that the Abbot Didier had a pharos, or great silver crown, weighing one hundred pounds, constructed, which was surmounted by twelve little turrets, and from which were suspended six and thirty lamps. \n_Excerpt from \u201cLighthouses and Lightships\u201d_\n## Features\nInter comes with many OpenType features which can be", "title": "The Inter typeface, renowned for its 2000+ glyphs, 147-language support, and optical sizes, is widely adopted in global applications from NASA systems to digital interfaces, leveraging OpenType features and open-source accessibility.", "summary": "Inter is a versatile, open-source typeface designed for various applications, from user interfaces to marketing and signage.

In February 2025, we focused on a comprehensive overhaul of internal processes and customer relations to enhance performance and scalability.\n**TL;DR:** Here\u2019s what we accomplished last month:\n  * Integrated support for **Sonic** , the new blockchain by Andre Cronje\n  * Initiated migration to a **CU-based pricing model**\n  * Published updated **Solana API** documentation\n  * Optimized **page load speeds** for a smoother experience\n  * Completed the first phases of an **internal audit** on tech design and processes\n  * Upgraded node clients for **Ethereum Holesky** and **Injective**\n  * And much more!\n\n\nHere are some details on our Feb 2025 endeavours.\n## Bye Fantom, Hi Sonic\nOn Wednesday, February 19, 2025, GetBlock deprecated support for Fantom, replacing it with Sonic by Sonic Labs, the next-generation L1 blockchain developed by DeFi pioneer Andre Cronje. Designed for higher transaction speeds, increased RPS, and greater cost efficiency, Sonic is set to push performance boundaries.\nGetBlock was among the first RPC node providers to offer shared and dedicated support for Sonic, ensuring seamless integration for developers.\nAdditionally, we discontinued support for Huobi Ecosystem Chain (HECO) following its official sunset announcement earlier in Q1 2025.\n## GetBlock replaces requests with CUs: What you need to know\nIn February 2025, we began transitioning from a request-based pricing model to a Compute Unit (CU)-based system, providing a more accurate measure of actual resource consumption.\nWe\u2019ve detailed our motivation and migration timeline in a dedicated blog post. In short, this shift enhances transparency, fairness, and protection against resource abuse.\n**Action required:** Please update your contact preferences (Account \u2192 Settings \u2192 Notification Settings) to ensure you receive important migration alerts and instructions.\n## New Solana API reference documentation is out\nWe continued our mission to enhance the developer documentation portal. In February, we released new Solana API reference pages, covering the fundamentals of RPC method usage, common errors, code samples, and more.\nAs a Tier 1 Solana RPC node provider, GetBlock made headlines in 2024 with the launch of Solana Pro RPC, offering up to 1,000 RPS bandwidth, enhanced failover protection, and a feature-rich add-on suite.\n## Faster page loading and internal audit\nThanks to a series of technical optimizations and bug fixes, we have significantly improved page loading speeds across both mobile and desktop versions of GetBlock\u2019s key resources.\nThis performance upgrade was accompanied by an internal technical audit focused on website architecture, business logic, and security measures. While the first audit phases are now complete, we will share key findings and their impact on our development roadmap in future updates.\n## Network upgrades: Welcoming Pectra, Nivara, and more\nOur engineers rolled out multiple client software updates to maintain seamless operations across all nodes, benefiting both shared and dedicated endpoint users.\n### Pectra (Holesky testnet)\nIn February 2025, Ethereum took a major step toward the Prague-Electra (Pectra) upgrade by activating it on Holesky. GetBlock promptly updated its nodes to ensure full compatibility.\nAs we detailed in our Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Guide, this upcoming hard fork will be Ethereum\u2019s most ambitious upgrade since its migration from PoW to PoS in 2022.\n### Injective Nivara\nFebruary 2025 Injective Nivara mainnet hardfork, also supported by GetBlock, implemented advanced RWA oracle price update support in the chain stream, and updated RWA architecture on Injective as such.\nIt also strengthened exchange modules security and added protective measures including segregated wallet implementation for potentially suspicious deposits. Nivara enforced batch fee constraints, and new event logging for successful deposits.\n## Closing thoughts: Gearing up for dedicated nodes upgrade\nThat\u2019s a wrap for February! Spring is coming, Web3 fam, and March 2025 will bring exciting updates on performance enhancements and dedicated node upgrades.\nThank you for building with us!\nWarm regards,The GetBlock Team\nGETBLOCK\nMarch 4, 2025\n4 min read\nPopular Posts\nJune 9, 2021\n4 min read\nRunning Full and Archive Node of Binance Smart Chain: Why Might You Need It\nNovember 9, 2021\n5 min read\nTop 10 BSC Ethereum Polygon Nodes Providers State of the Market \nMay 24, 2022\n5 min read\nWhat is a dApp?

The nearly $20,000 trading range reflects significant market uncertainty amid various global economic developments.\nChina\u2019s potential economic stimulus measures are taking center stage as a possible catalyst for bitcoin\u2019s next price movement. **Arthur Hayes** , co-founder of Bitmex and current head of Maelstrom investment fund, highlighted the importance of monitoring China\u2019s economic policy in , where he predicted a \u201cfinal filthy fiat financial market convulsion\u201d that could eventually propel bitcoin beyond $1 million.\n_\u201cXi Jinping wants to keep the yuan stable against the dollar, whether for good or bad. If the dollar supply increases, he can instruct the People\u2019s Bank of China to increase the yuan supply, ensuring the dollar-yuan exchange rate remains stable,\u201d_ Hayes wrote.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s governor **Pan Gongsheng** has already confirmed plans to cut interest rates and inject liquidity into the financial system \u201cat an appropriate time,\u201d as by Reuters. This follows November\u2019s $1.4 trillion debt package designed to ease local government financing strains and stabilize economic growth\u2014measures accelerated by Trump\u2019s trade tariffs that threaten to escalate into a global trade war.\nHistorical precedent suggests these developments could benefit bitcoin prices.

Most likely, Apple Vision Pro is coming soon to Spain and Italy. Although there are many other countries that also speak Spanish, visionOS code suggests that the system has been localized for the European variation of Spanish.\nGiven that Apple says iOS 18.4 and visionOS 2.4 will be released to the public in April, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that Vision Pro will arrive in these countries around the same time.\nApple Vision Pro was launched first in the US and then in China, Japan and Singapore.

It's easy to switch between 2D and 3D views allowing you to create 2D flor plans or do a virtual walking tour of the space. You can even add lighting and furniture to get a feel for how the space would look in real life. \nYou don't typically need an architect to draw house plans (2D plans or 3D models). If you are looking to get a feel for the space and try different layout options then you can easily do this yourself with a free app like Arcadium 3D. If you wanted something that's manually verfied, you may want to get a Measured Survery done. This again doesn't require an architect and has the benefit that a surveyor will come and take all the house measurements for you. \nDrawing floor plans yourself is easy to do with free software like Arcadium 3D. Once you've got the dimensions of your house, you can add the walls, windows and doors with a drag and drop interface. Walls can be adjusted to the right length and thinckness. Doors and windows can be automatically cut out from the walls. \nWhile you can use approximate rules of thumb (such as 15 lumens per square foot) this doesn't tell you where to locate the lights and how they will feel in a space. Modern room layout and 3D modelling apps such as Arcadium 3D let you add lights straight into your 3D floor plans. This way you can see if there are any dark corners or overly bright zones. Arcadium lets you choose the type of light you want from a wide selection of table lamps, wall lights, floor lamps or pendant lights. It's also possible to adjust the brightness of each light individually. \nYes! You can sign up and use the free account.

She expressed concern about the future of civil society work on North Korean human rights.\nThe cause for alarm is a sudden freeze on the funds of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)- a US nongovernmental organisation.\nOne major beneficiary of funds from the NED are groups documenting and helping to stop human rights abuses in North Korea.\nThe funding halt threatens to damage further the lives of people living under one of the world\u2019s most egregious authoritarian regimes.\n## What is the NED?\nThe NED is a US institution with a long history in its foreign policy, described as a \u201cbastion of Republican internationalism\u201d. Established by an act of Congress, it was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1983. \nWith bipartisan support, the NED is squarely based on core Republican values of spreading democracy through the world. It supports the work of nongovernmental organisations in more than 100 countries every year.\nWhile it is unclear why Elon Musk, in his role in the Department of Government Efficiency, has suddenly taken aim at this institution, the consequences of cutting off funding overnight are easy to see.\nOne result is the likely end of decades-long work on North Korean human rights. \n## How this affects North Korea\nOne of the groups hit hard by this funding freeze is the Citizens\u2019 Alliance for North Korean Human Rights. The original single-issue North Korean human rights organisation, it\u2019s now planning to shut its doors. \nWithout NED funding, it says it cannot cover its running costs, such as paying the rent or staff salaries. \nIt also can\u2019t continue its important work investigating and documenting human rights abuses suffered by North Korean people.\nThe Citizens\u2019 Alliance is just one of many groups, most of which are based in South Korea, that rely on the NED for their work.\nThe political environment in South Korea is uncertain and precarious for North Korean human rights activists. Despite efforts to diversify funding sources over many decades, there are few other options. \nI have studied this question in-depth and over two decades. It\u2019s a problem that cannot be overcome overnight, or even in the medium term, as it\u2019s so deeply embedded, both politically and socially.\nIn the absence of funding opportunities in South Korea, Seoul-based groups must look abroad. \nYet many of the international support schemes available exist to fund in-country democratisation and human rights efforts. \nThe authoritarian regime in North Korea is so complete that no active, open civil society efforts can safely take place. The movement relies entirely on transnational activism and so doesn\u2019t neatly fit into existing funding schemes.\nOn top of this, the funding freeze comes at a particularly bad time, with South Korea in a state of political turmoil. In the wake of the President Yoon Suk-yeol\u2019s impeachment following his declaration of martial law, it is unclear what the future of the limited number of existing initiatives will be.\n## Putting North Korea in the spotlight\nFor a long time, the plight of those suffering human rights abuses inside the secretive country was not well known to the outside world. \nFor decades, civil society groups built coalitions, gathered information, wrote reports, compiled databases, held public awareness-raising events, and lobbied politicians at all different levels. They then succeeded in bringing about the 2014 UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korean Human Rights.\nThis inquiry, chaired by Australia\u2019s Michael Kirby, has been the definitive document on North Korean human rights for more than ten years. \nIts findings of gross violations of human rights inside the country have formed the evidentiary basis for international action on North Korean human rights. Examples of the report\u2019s findings include:\n  * the use of political prison camps, torture, executions and other sorts of arbitrary detention to suppress real or perceived political dissent\n  * an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and association \n  * the use of access to food as a means of control over the population.\n\n\nNon-profit North Korean human rights groups remain at the centre of this work. Having succeeded in putting the issue squarely on the international agenda, they continue to press for greater attention on the human rights situation from the international community.\nThe groups relying on NED funding do a wide range of work. They support North Koreans living in South Korea and elsewhere abroad. Some provide support to formally record human rights abuses, helping build a robust database of testimony from survivors. \nOthers back in-country accounts from underground North Korean journalists, and more still do myriad other advocacy, support and accountability work.\nBut now this work could all end more suddenly than anyone could have expected.\n## More power to a dictator\nThe Database Center for North Korean Human Rights has paused all but its most urgent programs and launched an appeal for donations. Executive Director Hannah Song has described the situation as a crisis of \u201ca massive and sudden cut to funding that threatens the crucial work of those on the frontlines\u201d.\nSokeel Park, the leader of another nongovernmental group working in this space, described it as \u201cby far the biggest crisis facing NGOs working on this issue since the start of the movement in the 1990s\u201d.\nThis is no exaggeration. The North Korean human rights movement has had an outsized effect on the international community\u2019s awareness and understanding of how the North Korean government maintains order and represses dissent.\nSo who wins out of this? North Korea\u2019s Supreme Leader and dictator, Kim Jong-un.\nBack in 2018, US President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address centred on the human rights violations suffered by the North Korean people at the hands of the authoritarian regime. Trump declared:\n> we need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose.\nNow, by effectively silencing the government\u2019s most vocal critics, the Trump administration appears to be giving breathing room to one of the world\u2019s most atrocious authoritarian regimes.\n_Danielle Chubb does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._", "title": "The abrupt funding freeze on the National Endowment for Democracy jeopardizes North Korean human rights efforts, threatening the closure of key organizations and empowering authoritarian leader Kim Jong-un amid U.S. policy shifts and South Korean political turmoil.", "summary": "The US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) has suddenly frozen its funds, threatening the work of groups documenting and combating human rights abuses in North Korea.

Wrapped summarises favourite artists, most-played songs, and other highlights. Many users share their Wrapped results on social media to showcase their playlist for the year.\nSpotify, a subscription-based audio streaming platform, offers its users access to an extensive library of music, podcasts, and other media content.\nFounded in 2006 by Swedish entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, the Stockholm-based platform has become a global entity with offices in numerous countries. As of mid-2024, Spotify boasts 626 million active users worldwide.\nOne of Spotify\u2019s iconic features is Wrapped, introduced in 2016. Since then, sharing Spotify Wrapped to social media has become an annual tradition for users as a point of pride, creating a viral wave in the digital world.\nLaunched globally on December 1, 2020, Spotify Wrapped triggered a significant surge in app downloads during the first week of that month \u2013 up by 21%. This increase is assumed to be closely tied to the global launch of the feature. \nBut is this surge solely due to this momentum? \n## Wrapped: Delivering personal and universal experiences\nWrapped spotlights Spotify\u2019s advanced user behaviour statistics and drives consumers into unintentional platform boosters. When consumers share their Wrapped on social media, they unwittingly become brand advocates, promoting the platform to others.\nThe personalisation, social proof, and gamification embedded in Spotify Wrapped transform it from merely an individual report into a globally celebrated cultural event. The campaign\u2019s intelligent design encourages users to share their data summaries online, creating massive organic promotion. \nIn addition to its viral nature, Wrapped influences users\u2019 future listening habits. Showcasing users\u2019 favourite genres and artists annually motivates them to explore their musical preferences and discover dynamic new tracks.\n## Lessons from Wrapped\nBoasting its considerable impact, Wrapped\u2019s formula has spread to gaming platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Steam, as of 2024. Three key takeaways from Spotify\u2019s success:\n**1. Personalisation:** Wrapped provides a summary of user habits, reflecting their moods, experiences, and interests during the year, delivering an intimate experience.\n**2. Social Connectivity:** Wrapped challenges people to post stuff on social media. Aside from boasting, this practice allows people to compare their musical interests, establishing a sense of belonging and community. This social aspect improves user satisfaction and strengthens their self-perception.\n**3. Nostalgia:** Wrapped taps into individuals\u2019 nostalgia by bringing back memories through their favorite songs and artists. Like old photos evoking cherished memories, music can stimulate positive emotions and strengthen personal identity.\n## Challenges in replicating Wrapped\u2019s success\nWhile Wrapped thrives on Spotify, replicating such an approach on other platforms may prove difficult, particularly for shopping or transportation apps. Data summaries from transportation apps like Gojek that track daily destinations or favourite meals might be deemed overly personal and clash with privacy concerns \u2013 a sensitive topic nowadays.\nThis relates to the privacy paradox, where users are wary about their personal data security but continue sharing it if it doesn\u2019t include highly sensitive information like profession, personal traits, or financial details. In Spotify\u2019s case, users feel safe because the data shared doesn\u2019t fall into such categories.\nMoreover, adopting a similar concept on other platforms may not yield users the same satisfaction with Spotify Wrapped. The strategy could even backfire.\nFor example, suppose transportation or online shopping platforms were to present users with a summary of their spending over a year instead of encouraging consumption. In that case, users might be prompted to save money after realising the extent of their expenditures.\nA study has proven that when people are aware of how much money they spend and consider its implications for the future, they are more likely to save.\nAnother research also indicates that consistently tracking expenses leads to better financial outcomes. For instance, individuals may reduce unnecessary purchases, adhere more strictly to budgets, and manage their money more effectively.\nThese three aspects set Spotify apart from other popular platforms. On Spotify, users share Wrapped because it is perceived as enjoyable and positive. In contrast, applying similar strategies on different platforms could potentially reduce consumption.\n## Adapting Wrapped features for consumer platforms\nAlthough challenging, the concept of Wrapped can still be adapted to other platforms with some adjustments.\nFor instance, on ride-hailing platforms, many positive aspects unrelated to spending can still be appealing for social media sharing.

This tells us how much carbon is stored in these ecosystems \u2013 but very little about how carbon flows through them and the factors that influence whether it is stored or emitted.\nResearch shows seagrass meadows, mangroves, saltmarshes and kelp forests are significant carbon stores. Shutterstock/Daniel Poloha\nThis is important. Marine ecosystems can be both sinks or sources of carbon. If we don\u2019t understand how organic material is transformed or how carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is either taken up by plants or emitted into the atmosphere, we will likely make poor decisions about nature-based solutions.\nTo address this, we have invited researchers from the Scandinavian research partnership CoastClim \u2013 an innovative project linking seafloor biodiversity and climate \u2013 to bring their unique set of instrumentation to New Zealand to explore patterns in greenhouse gas emissions from the seafloor.\nThe measurements we made this summer are tracking emissions of methane and CO\u2082 from seafloor sediments in the upper reaches of several harbours (Waitemata, Mahurangi and Whangateau) in the Auckland region. \nWe found CO\u2082 concentrations were up to eight times higher than atmospheric levels in more disturbed and polluted parts of these harbours. Methane concentrations were up to 30 times higher. This shows that degraded habitats are indeed transformed into net emitters of greenhouse gases.\n## Paying attention to land-coast connections\nThere has been concern about the health of the Firth of Thames, at the back of the Hauraki Gulf, because the area drains a large catchment with intensive agriculture. \nWe found this region is a significant source of greenhouse gases. \nOur sampling on the open coast revealed high draw-down of CO\u2082 in healthy patches of kelp. But this effect was reversed in areas where New Zealand\u2019s endemic sea urchin, kina, has grazed off the kelp. These regions are known as kina barrens and they dominate many non-protected reefs. \nKina, New Zealand\u2019s endemic sea urchin, grazes on kelp and can turn the seafloor into a source of emissions. Wikimedia Commons/Shaun Lee, CC BY\nOur data highlight an important finding relevant to how we manage marine ecosystems and address both the biodiversity and climate crises. As we stress and degrade these ecosystems, they have less capacity to process carbon in ways that store it or move it into food webs. The system fails in its self-regulation and transforms into a net source of greenhouse gases.\nWe argue that we have to manage these ecosystems in an integrative fashion, considering the long-term stores of carbon and the time it takes to build them up, along with the many processes that move carbon from one part of the ecosystem to another. \nConsidering the dynamics of marine carbon and restoring or protecting coastal ecosystems are good options for addressing multiple challenges. We shouldn\u2019t just be looking for good places to bank carbon but also those where good management can reduce seafloor disturbance and therefore limit the release of greenhouse gases.\n## Considering climate and biodiversity\nThis project highlights the importance of considering both biodiversity and climate together. If we manage one ignorant of the other, we risk failure because biodiversity matters to how we address climate change.\nThis holistic understanding of the stock and flows of carbon (long-term sequestration and carbon in living organisms) is necessary if we are to identify viable long-term carbon stores. It is also crucial to assessing how the stresses we put on the marine environment can turn an ecosystem from a carbon sink to a source. \nWorking with our Scandinavian colleagues also confirmed our earlier research. For a number of years, we have been studying how different stressors \u2013 including sediment disturbance, nutrient flows from land and microplastic pollution affect the way nitrogen, carbon and oxygen are processed in coastal sediments.\nThese processes have implications for the release of greenhouse gases. But until now, we have not been able to test some connections and close the loop on some of our ideas. \nAs with most interventions to natural ecosystems, we are better off accepting they are complex, and that any supposed \u201csilver bullet\u201d solutions can have unintended consequences.\n_Simon Francis Thrush receives funding from currently from MBIE and the Auckland Foundation._", "title": "New Zealand's marine ecosystems, including degraded harbors emitting high greenhouse gases and kina-barren areas, require integrated climate and biodiversity management strategies informed by CoastClim research to enhance carbon storage and mitigate emissions.", "summary": "New Zealand, with an underwater territory 14 times its landmass, is exploring marine ecosystems as carbon storage options, as highlighted in its 2026-2030 emissions reduction plan.

After Ivan disappears, Ani searches through New York with his handler Toros (Karren Karagulian) to find him.\nBaker\u2019s Oscars sweep capped off a string of wins over the past year, but surprised many pundits who expected three-and-a-half hour epic The Brutalist to take home the top prize.\nHe\u2019s made the 97th Academy Awards one for the history books. So who is Sean Baker?\n## An indie film lifer\nBaker has been a fixture of the international film festival circuit for more than a decade. His films are carefully researched character studies, often focused on sex workers, immigrants and low-income communities. \nBaker maintains creative control by working with ultra-low budgets, often serving as writer, director and editor simultaneously. He often casts new or non-professional actors and prefers to shoot on location with natural light.\nHis breakout film Tangerine (2015) followed two transgender African American sex workers in Los Angeles. Tangerine grapples with the complicated lives of its characters but also celebrates their humour and friendships. The film was a technical milestone: shot entirely on the iPhone 5S by cinematographer Radium Cheung. The total estimated budget was just US$100,000.\nBaker\u2019s next film, The Florida Project (2017), was a portrait of low-income children living in cheap motels near Walt Disney World. The film playfully frames its characters\u2019 difficult childhoods as colourful and ecstatic, drawing an outstanding performance from six-year-old star Brooklynn Prince in her first film appearance.\nRed Rocket (2021) centred on a retired porn star returning to his Texas home town, but struggled at the box office amid the COVID pandemic.\nBaker\u2019s film budgets have increased gradually over time, but have still remained very small by Hollywood standards. The Florida Project was produced on a measly budget of US$2 million, while Anora cost just US$6 million. For context, the production of last year\u2019s best picture winner Oppenheimer (2023) cost Universal Pictures about US$100 million (before marketing costs).\n## The high price of creative freedom\nAnora premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2024, where it won the coveted Palme d'Or. \nThe Palme d'Or is widely considered the most prestigious award in international art cinema \u2013 and has launched previous Oscar winners such as Parasite (2019), The Zone of Interest (2023) and Anatomy of a Fall (2023). These awards play an important role in marketing and financing films outside the studio system. \nThe realities of independent filmmaking are harsher than the glittering appearance of awards season. Independent filmmakers are often precariously employed and earn modest incomes from their work.\nIn a speech delivered at the Director\u2019s Guild of America Awards earlier this month, Baker laid out the financial difficulties associated with working as an indie director:\n> It\u2019s just simply not enough to get by on in today\u2019s world, especially if one is is trying to support a family. I personally do not have children, but I know for a fact that if I did, I would not be able to make the movies that I make.\nFellow nominee Brady Corbet, who made The Brutalist with about US$10 million, faced similar challenges, saying in an interview with Vanity Fair that he had made nothing from his two previous films.\n## Little films on the big screen\nAnora has arrived during a time of great upheaval in Hollywood. Studios and streaming giants are adjusting their business models to maximise profits. \nMeanwhile, the industry is still recovering from strikes in 2023 by the Writers Guild of America and The Screen Actors Guild\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which shut down productions for months.\nHollywood has often turned to independent filmmakers in such moments of crisis. In the 1970s, independent filmmakers such as John Cassavetes, Roger Corman, George Lucas and David Lynch disrupted an industry that was stagnating after its Golden Age.\nToday, distributors such as Neon (which distributed Anora) and A24 specialise in marketing independent films through careful awards campaigns and viral marketing strategies.\nBaker\u2019s win underscores the role of independent films \u2014 less constrained by commercial expectations \u2014 in shaping the industry\u2019s future. By taking greater creative risks, his style of intimate filmmaking is a breath of fresh air in Hollywood\u2019s stuffy, franchise-driven business model.\n_Duncan Caillard does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._", "title": "Sean Baker's historic Oscar sweep with Anora highlights the impact of low-budget, character-driven indie films amid Hollywood's financial and structural challenges.", "summary": "Sean Baker, an indie filmmaker, made history by winning four Academy Awards for his film Anora, including Best Picture, Directing, Film Editing, and Original Screenplay.

Points are awarded on various performance metrics, depending on the sport.\nMany fantasy leagues also incorporate a stock market-like element. When a real-life player exceeds expectations, their fantasy value increases, while underperformance leads to a decrease in value. \nThis allows coaches to trade players in and out strategically, aiming to build the most valuable and high-scoring team during a season. \nSuccess in fantasy sports often depends on statistical analysis, player scouting, and smart decision-making when it comes to trades and team selection.\n## The origins of fantasy sports\nThe first mainstream fantasy game can be attributed to Rotisserie League Baseball in 1980 by Daniel Okrent and friends. \nRotisserie League Baseball is said to be the oldest fantasy sports league in the world.\nThis league required participants to track their own players\u2019 progress using a scoring system based on statistics obtained in newspapers after a game. \nWith the rapid progression of technology, fantasy sports have evolved significantly, with most major sporting codes worldwide now offering multiple fantasy platforms, formats and prizes. \nIn Australia, the number of people playing fantasy sports has doubled since 2021, with nearly 2.5 million players engaged in one league or another. \nThis growth presents opportunities for content creation, expanded revenue streams, and potentially increased engagement with sports betting.\n## Fan engagement\nThe way fans engage with sports has evolved with the rise of fantasy sports, social media, and real time data tracking, leading to \u201csecond screen consumption\u201d. \nThis involves fans using multiple digital platforms such as fantasy sports apps, social media and tracking of live statistics while simultaneously watching live broadcasts. \nThis shift has redefined the traditional sports fandom experience.\nFantasy coaches watch more games each week, with a dual identity that extends beyond traditional loyalty to the team they support. \nWhile sports fans have historically supported a single team, fantasy sports reshape fan identity by encouraging engagement with both their favourite team and their fantasy team. Fans often watch games they normally wouldn\u2019t be interested in specifically to watch the fantasy-relevant players involved.\nCommunity engagement is a key motivator for participation, often surpassing interest in the real-life sports.\nIn Australia, a study by News Corporation Australia, which owns SuperCoach, found bragging rights, social connection and learning more about sport drive participation. \nWhile prizes matter, the main reason people join is to connect with others.\nIn 2021, Australian fantasy players were largely concentrated in the larger sporting codes such as the AFL and NRL, but by 2023 it had broadened into the Big Bash League (BBL) and National Basketball League (NBL). \nThere are many Australians playing fantasy leagues in global sports too, from the English Premier League (soccer) to the United States\u2019 National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball Association (NBA). Some 14% of the Australian fantasy audience plays in global leagues.\n## Media involvement\nWith some sporting seasons becoming longer and the connection to fantasy sports extending beyond live games, fans are kept invested throughout the off-season as they analyse trades, follow pre-season developments and prepare for the next competition. \n* * *\n_**Read more:How the AFL and NRL have crept into cricket's traditional summer timeslot ** _\n* * *\nThis almost year-round involvement offers extended media coverage and consumption of new content in a variety of formats.\nFantasy sport complements traditional media by offering alternative coverage, such as podcasts and short-form content that extends beyond game day, keeping fans connected throughout the week as they adjust their lineups and strategies.\nFantasy sports are also boosting viewership for new formats like AFLW by increasing fan engagement.\n## Rich pickings\nFantasy sport has been big business for a long time but the global fantasy sports market is challenging to quantify. \nIn 2013, Forbes estimated the NFL fantasy football market alone to be worth $US70 billion ($A111 billion), significantly surpassing the NFL\u2019s 2021 revenue of $US11 billion ($A17 billion), highlighting its major role in the global sporting market. \nBig revenues mainly come from sponsorship and advertising on fantasy platforms. \nMajor brands invest hundreds of millions of dollars in targeted advertising campaigns to capitalise on this engaged audience.\nMoney is also made by charging fees to enter some contests and to access premium analytics content, in-app purchases, and related entertainment products like websites and podcasts.\n## Links to sports betting\nMany of the advertisers on fantasy platforms are gambling businesses. \nFantasy organisations have tried to highlight the differences between fantasy sports and sports betting, which has been linked to poor mental health, family violence and even suicide. \nTheir key argument is that betting is a game of chance whereas fantasy sports are games of skill. \nDespite these differences, concerns have been raised about the links between fantasy sports and sports betting. \nAn Australian fantasy betting app was recently fined more than $A500,000 for illegally offering inducements to gamble in dozens of ads on its platform.\nWhether or not fantasy sports are likely to encourage gambling is a grey area \u2013 studies in this space are mixed. \nSome studies have found people who participate in fantasy sports are more likely to gamble and experience gambling-related problems. \nHowever, others describe fantasy sports as a more positive alternative to gambling and that participants are motivated by the social benefits, rather than being motivated by a chance to win money. \nAs fantasy sports continue to evolve and attract new players, their ability to deepen fan engagement, foster community connections, and enhance the sports watching experience ensures they will remain a dynamic and influential part of the sporting world.\n_I have worked with members of the AFL Fantasy Traders before in schools._\n_Vaughan Cruickshank does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._", "title": "Fantasy sports, pioneered by Daniel Okrent's Rotisserie League Baseball, engage millions globally through strategic player management, driving media consumption shifts and multi-billion dollar markets while navigating links to gambling.", "summary": "Fantasy sports have transformed the way fans interact with sports, extending interest beyond watching matches or supporting a favorite team.

By looking into the past, we can see what Canada can do in the present.\n* * *\n_**Read more:Like dictators before him, Trump threatens international peace and security ** _\n* * *\n## How Canada made a difference\nThe U.S. isn\u2019t the only country with a vested interest in maintaining the liberal international order \u2014 even if it has been the only nation with the will and capacity to serve as its safeguard.\nCanada was also present at the creation of the UN in 1945. They, too, played a fundamental part in the development of its specialized agencies \u2014 such as the WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nIn fact, Canada has been an engaged member of the international community. The country played a leading role in establishing the UN Emergency Force during the Suez Crisis, fighting apartheid in South Africa and building a coalition to ban anti-personnel land mines in the 1990s, to name a few examples.\nCanada has done so because it\u2019s been in the best interest of the country. A liberal, rules-based international order is a framework in which Canada can make a meaningful difference in global affairs disproportionate to its limited size and capabilities.\nIt also makes for a more prosperous, stable and peaceful world. One where norms, rules and institutions constrain aggressive or malevolent world leaders and facilitates co-operation on global problems.\nBut what can lessons from the past offer Canada in sustaining global order in an \u201cAmerica First\u201d world. This is a policy espoused by the Trump administration that is focused inwards. It approaches international affairs as a transactional, zero-sum game.\n## Learning from the past\nFirst, Canada is at its most effective when Canadians act in unison towards a common goal.\nDuring the Ethiopian famine in the 1980s, Canadians of all stripes and levels of government worked in tandem to organize a truly national response to alleviate the humanitarian crisis. Regular citizens contributed more than $30 million \u2014 potentially saving over 700,000 people from starvation.\nThis domestic political consensus also provided the requisite support for the federal government to co-ordinate an international famine relief effort. This was despite the resistance of Canada\u2019s major allies in the U.S. and the U.K., due to the Marxist orientation of the Ethiopian government.\nGranted, few international causes offer such grounds for unity. Political polarization has only made this type of unity more difficult. And yet, as recent events (such as Trump\u2019s threat to coerce Canada into becoming the 51st state) make clear, Canadians are willing to put aside their differences and rally together when there\u2019s a coherent vision for the country rooted in its values and aspirations.\nSecond, Canada needs to work closely with like-minded states through multilateral institutions \u2014 such as the United Nations and the Commonwealth. Under Brian Mulroney\u2019s Progressive Conservative government, Canada relied on its membership in nearly every major international association to build and maintain the global coalition against South African apartheid.\n* * *\n_**Read more:Brian Mulroney's tough stand against apartheid is one of his most important legacies ** _\n* * *\nAustralia, India, Zambia and Zimbabwe emerged as key partners. Such efforts entailed both political and economic costs. But there was a reason why one of Nelson Mandela\u2019s first visits following his release from prison in 1990 was to Canada.\nBy redoubling its engagement in international organizations, Canada can punch above its weight in world affairs and shape global priorities. It also provides a counter to the influence of the United States in Canadian foreign policy.\nThird, the U.S. is more than its president. Canada can still cultivate ties with Americans beyond the White House. Returning to the Mulroney government, Ottawa\u2019s efforts to persuade the Ronald Reagan administration to negotiate restrictions on emissions resulting in acid rain were unsuccessful.\nNonetheless, by lobbying congressional leaders in impacted states and partnering with environmental non-governmental organizations, Canada and the U.S. eventually agreed to the 1991 Air Quality Agreement.\n## Surviving hostile administrations\nCanada should also be realistic about the degree to which it can diversify its economic and diplomatic relationships outside of the U.S.\nIn the early 1970s, President Richard Nixon imposed a 10 per cent surcharge on Canadian imports. Then, just as it is now, Ottawa looked for alternative markets to offset Canada\u2019s dependency on the Americans. These initiatives ultimately failed to materialize \u2014 but the surcharge was rescinded. Canada-U.S. relations ultimately survived the Nixon administration.\nSimilarly, while Trump has offered a stark reminder that Canada needs to take an active role in sustaining the rules-based international order on which it depends, the ties that bind the two countries together are deeper and longer-lasting than any one administration or government.\nEven so, with a world in chaos, Canada needs to step up to defend international norms and institutions. It has done so in the past and can do so again \u2014 provided it develops a coherent foreign policy strategy moving forward.\n_Daniel Manulak receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada._", "title": "Canada must leverage historical strategies like domestic unity, multilateral partnerships, and engagement with U.S. stakeholders to sustain the rules-based international order as the U.S. withdraws under Trump's policies.", "summary": "The US is abandoning its role as anchor of the liberal world order, prompting Canada to clarify its vision and accept responsibility for sustaining the rules-based global order.

Here are 5 other options\n\nMaster1305/Shutterstock\nWhether it\u2019s for a work meeting or a class assignment, presenting data to others is a common task on our to-do list.\nWe use data to make decisions on our health, finances and the world we live in, yet finding the best ways to communicate data without boring your audience can be daunting.\nHowever, there are some tried and true techniques to getting your message across effectively. \nFirst, you need to boost your data literacy \u2013 which includes learning about the different kind of charts and how to use them.\n## What is data literacy?\nData literacy is the ability to \u201cplot\u201d and present complex data in a way that\u2019s easy to digest. There is even a branch of statistics focusing on the best way to present data.\nIt\u2019s one of the most desired skills in the workplace, yet a 2020 survey found only one in five employees across nine different countries (including Australia) believe they are data literate.\nWith seemingly countless options available, choosing the right chart is challenging, and the wrong choice can influence how data is interpreted. \n## Passing on the humble pie\nPie charts are often the first pick when it comes to presenting data with different categories, such as age group or blood type. These categories are represented as slices, with the size of each slice proportional to the amount of data.\n* * *\n* * *\nDoughnut charts, a close relative of the pie chart, work the same way but are shown with a hole in the middle.\n* * *\n* * *\nAs delicious as they sound, these charts should be consumed in moderation. \nPie charts present data in a circular pattern, making it difficult to make comparisons when there are many groups, or when groups are similar in size. They can also misrepresent data entirely, especially when data add up to over 100%.\nHere are some alternatives to pie charts that sound just as tasty, but are easier to digest.\n## Bar charts\nBar charts summarise data across different categories, but present them next to each other. This makes it easier to compare several categories at once. \nHere is an example from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing the different generations from the last census.\n* * *\n* * *\n## Waffle charts\nWaffle charts are a good option for data organised by categories. \nThey present data in a grid, with each unit representing a fixed number. This is useful for presenting both large and small percentages that are difficult to compare side-by-side.\n* * *\n* * *\nWe can clearly see most people eat meat from the figure.\nHowever, a bar chart would make comparing less common diets difficult. With a waffle chart, we can see 4% of people surveyed are vegan, while 2% are pescetarian.\n## Histograms\nData often represent different measurements, such as height and weight, or time taken to write an article.\nHistograms also present data with bars but, unlike bar charts, are used for data collected as numbers, or numerical data.\nThis chart type is used to show how a set of numbers are spread out, and can be useful in seeing which numbers occur more often than others.\nIt\u2019s tempting to simplify data by fitting them into categories, but this can sometimes hide interesting facts.\nThe example below shows the body mass index (BMI) of a group of people as a bar chart.\n* * *\n* * *\nIt\u2019s easy to lose information when trying to simplify BMI into categories, especially among people who may be obese.\nEach category in the bar chart could easily be misunderstood as representing BMI as similar ranges. However, if we look at the histogram, BMI for obese people can be as high as 70.\n* * *\n* * *\nA doctor using this data would need to take into account that someone with a BMI of 60 may need a different treatment method compared to someone with a BMI of 30.\n## Line charts and scatterplots\nOther chart types for numerical data, such as line charts and scatterplots, allow us to explore how different measurements are related to one another. \nLine charts are used to visualise trends over time, such as stock prices and weekly flu cases.\n* * *\n* * *\nIn contrast, scatterplots show how two different measurements collected on the same subject are related.\nWhile scatterplots summarise trends, they sometimes show unusual results that would go unnoticed if measurements were charted separately. \nFor example, the figure below compares life expectancy and health expenditure in different countries.\n* * *\n* * *\nIf we\u2019re only looking at health expenditure, people from the United States would appear healthier as the US spends the most money on health care per person. \nPresenting this information along with life expectancy tells a different story.\n## Keep it simple and avoid \u2018chart junk\u2019\nIt is always tempting to add more information.\n\u201cChart junk\u201d refers to extra information such as excess labels, 3D effects or even different types of data in the same chart. \n* * *\nExample of a chart filled with \u2018junk\u2019. ResearchGate, CC BY\n* * *\nThis makes them more difficult to read and can distort the data, and is usually a sign your data is too complicated. You\u2019re better off using multiple charts to tell the full story.\nAs Coco Chanel once said, \u201csimplicity is the keynote of all true elegance\u201d.\nKeep these words in mind and choose a chart that keeps it simple without compromising style, content and detail.\n_Nicole White is a member of the Statistical Society of Australia._", "title": "Bar charts, histograms, and scatterplots offer clearer data presentation than pie charts, with Nicole White emphasizing simplicity to avoid 'chart junk' in effective visualization.", "summary": "Effective Data Presentation: Alternatives to Pie Charts\n\nPresenting data without boring your audience can be daunting, but boosting your data literacy can help.

Rephrasing the classic: _there are two types of programming languages: ones that people complain about and ones that nobody uses._ I've started my journey with Rust in 2018 and I've been working in it full time since 2021.\nI love Rust a lot for many things: good std lib abstractions, ergonomics (to some extend), the best build toolchain in the world (I've tried many things, but cargo is easily number one across programming languages landscape). But mostly I love how it brought sanity into systems programming and gave a viable alternative to this hollow abomination called C++ (and CMAKE).\nBut **what do I mean by term business apps**? Nowadays, its all sorts of services targeting various kinds of user/asset management, be it a bank portal, online shop or any other sort of systems. This also covers to huge extend, as they bring your focus outside of main concerns that Rust shines in.\nThese systems usually have similar shell: a web service providing some API, a database to manage system information and all sorts of other service connectors.\nThese systems are characteristic because their main complexity comes from the domain: which is not hardware/software related but it's more about modelling complexities of human interactions in code. Quite often the most performance-sensitive parts related to I/O access (databases, HTTP communication) and serialization and solved by tuning access to the other services we use, not the algorithms we write ourselves.\nThese systems where famously written in many different languages, from Python/Ruby/JavaScript/PHP to Java/C#/Go. Question is: are business apps a good use case for Rust?\nSpoilers: in my opinion, No. Now lets explain why.\n## Standard library\nOne of the nice things about Rust is that its abstractions defined in standard library feel right in size and scope. On the other side, std lib itself is woefully lacking: no RNG, cryptography or serialization. Even some things that should have been language features since day one - like and - are supplied as 3rd party macros.\nOn the other side Rust package ecosystem is enormous. You have everything, from with dozen of services supported, down to that you can use to () connect to your butt plug.\nWhile languages such as Go enable you to write pretty much entire HTTP service from standard lib alone, this package management comes with the burden: whenever you need to solve any mundane problem, you land in a space where everything has at least 7 different crates available, but half of them are actually a toy projects and most of them were not maintained for the last 5 years. And don't get me started about audits to check if one of 600 dependencies of your hello world app won't be used for supply chain attacks.\nIt takes time and attention to to sift the wheat from the chaff. Attention that is limited and could be put to better use elsewhere.\nAnd while many of these concerns have sense in systems programming, since they cover very different environments with very slim-tailored constraints - like WASM in the browser or embedded devices where even Rust's minimal standard lib is too much - they don't matter so much in a context of business apps, where solid defaults for common problems are desired: which is one the reasons for Go and .NET popularity in this domain.\n## Not abstract enough\nOne of the fantastic parts of Rust is that it manged to - mostly - live up to credo of zero-cost abstractions: situation where the performance of your high abstracted code (i.e. iterator ops or futures) is basically the same as their hand-rolled equivalent.\nThe problem is that Rust comes with some new concepts like lifetimes and mutability modifiers, that cannot be properly abstracted to the same degree as regular generics.\nIf you played with Rust you probably already seen those different kinds of iterators for / references, which basically have the same implementation but require twice the boilerplate code. The reason why is that mutability is not a generic property in Rust and cannot be abstracted over.\nSome languages like Pony offer an ability to control read/write access to fields and variables, but does it in a way that enables between them. PS: _I highly recommend learning Pony for its concept alone, which initially may seem to be more complex than Rusts mutability and borrow-checker but in practice is much more robust and avoids many pitfalls that Rust has, especially in multi-threaded programming_.\n### Dynamic trait references\nSince this rant already came to the topic of abstractions, let's talk about `dyn Trait`. First, let me praise Rust decision about explicitly showing references responsible for doing a virtual table dispatch in code.\nHowever Rust also decided to turn `Box<dyn Trait>`/`Arc<dyn Trait>` into fat pointers (similar to Go, and opposite to Java/.NET).\nShort explanation: unlike `Box<T>` which is basically a memory pointer, a memory representation for `Box<dyn T>` is two pointers - one for type's virtual table, and one for heap address where the corresponding object lives. This comes with few consequences:\n  * If you're working with C foreign function interface, there's no right C primitive to support you. You need to rollout something of your own, that most likely won't be compatible with existing solutions. Bizarre design decision given how important native interop is for Rust.\n  * If you want to introduce a lock-free mutability via Compare-And-Swap API (like the one that offers) and use dynamics at the same time... well, get fucked. You'll need extra layer of indirection, since this API is only available for pointer sized things.\n  * Some of the Rust APIs restrict you to work over `Sized` data - a types which size can be determined at compile time - which unfortunately puts a limitations on your generic params, i.e. if you ever want to use them in `Box<T>` context (since box pointer will have different size depending on what a `T` is).\n\n\nRust provides a workaround in form of dedicated that offer thin dynamic pointers as well, but since they are not part of standard lib, it's unlikely that you'll be able to use them across different libraries in the ecosystem without extra work.\n### Borrow checker: early adopter syndrome\nOne of the biggest value proposals of Rust is borrow checker. If you ever thought about reasons to learn Rust: a borrow-checker and ownership model is the one. It changes the way how you think about object graphs.\nRust is probably the first language that adopted borrow-checker as a regular tool in the non-esoteric language. However it comes with some drawbacks: at its current stage the borrow-checker is still not very advanced and extremely conservative, requiring programmer to do a lot of defensive programming and workarounds in order to make it happy. And most likely it will never be improved beyond minor points, as this would require a breaking change.\nIn short: _you can imagine borrow-checker as a recursive read/write lock enforced on all fields and variables at compiler level - at any time you can have multiple read-only references to the same object or one read-write reference, but never a mix of two. Additionally in order to have a reference of given type to a field in an object graph, you need to have the same (immutable/mutable) or stronger (mutable) reference to its parent._\nIf we think in category of locks, you can imagine a deadlock problem: when A needs to wait for B, and B needs to wait for A to acquire their corresponding locks. In Rust borrow-checker, such situations are compiler errors. The same logic is used by Rust to operate on actual locks, but don't worry: it doesn't mean that Rust is deadlock free language.\nWhat it means however, is that there's no easy way to represent cyclic data structures in Rust (here's description of ), since - unlike pretty much any other language - it explicitly disallows you to have two mutable/immutable references to the same variable (even in the same thread).\nAnd speaking of cyclic data structures: you can actually **sometimes** implement them in straight forward manner with `Rc<RefCell<T>>`/`Arc<Mutex<T>>`, but the problem is that:\n  1. `RefCell`s can easily blow up since they work the same way like borrow-checker, but during runtime, while `Mutex` can deadlock at runtime. Neither of them is \"zero cost\".\n  2. You need to keep track of references with strong and weak pointers, which is usually not an issue unless your object graph needs to be a bit more complicated for some reason. If not, you'll get a memory leak. One of the Rust promises was to reduce these, but it only works in comparison to traditional \"systems\" languages like C/C++. This comparison falls apart against managed languages.\n\n\nI get why it's there, but forcing it blindly and everywhere as a default behaviour is fucking bullshit: which apparently is acknowledged by the authors themselves, since the common way of getting immutable/mutable reference from an array is to into two separate references using method that operates using `unsafe` pointers under the hood. Shutout to all haters saying that unsafe Rust is not idiomatic: it's not only idiomatic, it's necessary.\n### Borrow checker and encapsulation\nAnother thing about borrow checker is that it has very shallow understanding of your code. It also explicitly makes a conservative assumption that if you call method over some reference, this method will try to access ALL fields of that references, forcing any other field accessed outside of it to be invalidated.\nLet's check this out on a following example:\n```\nstruct X {\n  commit_offset: usize,\n  entries: HashMap<u32, Vec<Entry>>,\n  changed: HashMap<u32, Vec<usize>>,\n}\nimpl X {\n  fn change_uncommitted<F>(&mut self, client: &u32, f: F)\n    where F: Fn(&mut", "title": "Rust's suitability for business applications is questioned due to its restrictive ownership model, fragmented ecosystem, and lack of high-level abstractions, contrasting with languages like Go and .NET that offer better defaults for common tasks.", "summary": "The author, a Rust developer since 2018, discusses why Rust may not be the best fit for building business applications, despite its strengths in systems programming.\n\n* **Standard Library Limitations**: Rust's standard library lacks essential features like RNG, cryptography, and serialization, leading to reliance on third-party crates, which can be overwhelming to manage and audit.\n\n* **Abstraction Challenges**: Rust's concepts like lifetimes and mutability modifiers cannot be fully abstracted, resulting in boilerplate code and limitations in dynamic trait references.\n\n* **Borrow Checker Drawbacks**: While innovative, Rust's borrow checker is conservative, requiring defensive programming and workarounds, and can make representing cyclic data structures difficult.\n\nKey concerns for business applications include:\n\n- **Dependency Management**: The vast number of crates can be time-consuming to sift through and audit.\n\n- **Abstraction and Encapsulation**: Rust's limitations in abstracting certain concepts and its shallow understanding of code encapsulation can lead to frustrations.\n\nThe author concludes that while Rust excels in systems programming, its current design and limitations make it less suitable for business applications, where solid defaults and ease of development are often prioritized.", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://mashable.com/article/trump-us-strategic-crypto-reserve-david-sacks-connection", "domains": ["Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets", "Government Policy"], "highlights": ["Trump announced the U.S. government would create a 'Crypto Strategic Reserve' buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano to counter Biden's policies and boost crypto markets.", "Critics criticized the move as conflicting with cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk, while White House crypto czar David Sacks urged patience without clarifying the proposal.", "David Sacks' prior investment in Solana and his firm Craft Ventures' holdings in the same five cryptocurrencies raise questions about potential conflicts of interest."], "names": ["Donald Trump", "Elon Musk", "David Sacks", "Solana"], "text": "# Trump attempts to bail out his wealthy cryptocurrency backers with U.S. crypto reserve\n\nJust a few days ago, Mashable _published an article_ investigating why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were suddenly in a freefall. Of the four main reasons, three were attributable to Donald Trump and his actions as president. \nThis is not exactly what one would expect from Trump, who promised to be a pro-crypto president after its advocates helped him win the presidency.\nBut over the weekend, as Bitcoin lost roughly one-fifth of its value, Trump suddenly made an announcement that temporarily sent cryptocurrencies' values skyrocketing once again.\nSEE ALSO: 4 reasons why Bitcoin value is nosediving. (Hint: It's Trump.)\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, Trump announced that the U.S. government would create a \"Crypto Strategic Reserve\" and begin buying various cryptocurrencies. Trump specifically mentioned five: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.\n\"A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,\" _posted_ Trump. \"I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\nCrypto immediately went up across the market. Bitcoin, for example, shot up from the $85,000 range to the $95,000 range, ending a seemingly downward spiral that the crypto market was experiencing. \nHowever, critics immediately called out Trump and his administration for the move. For one, it seemed like a bizarre strategy for an administration spearheading a cost-cutting initiative led by Elon Musk to use taxpayer dollars to buy up cryptocurrencies. \n\"Nobody announced a tax or a spending program,\" White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks _said_ to those critics. \"Maybe you should wait to find out what's actually being proposed.\"\n> Tweet may have been deleted \nSacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, never shared precisely what was being proposed as a followup.\nWhile most have likely heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the other three cryptocurrencies mentioned by the president serve very niche crypto audiences. Solana is probably best known as the platform on which many meme coins are built. For example, Trump's _  controversial meme coin_ is traded on the Solana blockchain. Some crypto advocates even criticized Trump's inclusion of XRP and ADA due to concerns regarding centralization and the lack of stablecoin issuers.\nBut speaking of Sacks, a big spotlight was also put on him and his seemingly coincidental connection to the five specific cryptocurrencies that Trump wants the U.S. government to buy.\nSacks was an early investor in Solana and, as a result, had a significant amount of Solana crypto holdings. Sacks claims he has since sold off all of his crypto holdings. However, Sacks has yet to speak to his venture capital firm Craft Ventures and its connection to the five specific cryptocurrencies.\nCraft Ventures invests in crypto companies such as Bitwise, a crypto asset manager with significant crypto holdings. Its top five cryptocurrency holdings? Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.\nWe'll have to wait and see exactly what Trump and Sacks have planned to fully look into the ramifications here, but so far, it's not looking good.\nAs for Trump's attempt to help the crypto markets, the bounce appears to have been only temporary. As of publication, most cryptocurrencies have dropped back to their trading levels before Trump's announcement.", "title": "Donald Trump's announcement of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve purchasing Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano faces criticism over cost conflicts and David Sacks' financial ties to the selected cryptocurrencies.", "summary": "Trump's sudden announcement to create a _Crypto Strategic Reserve_ has sparked controversy, as the US government would buy cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.

But , iOS 18.5 is set to solve Apple\u2019s biggest AI problems with two new features: major Siri upgrades and AI support in China.\n## What to expect from iOS 18.5, per Gurman\nIn his , Mark Gurman wrote about the new features coming in iOS 18.4, then pivoted to discuss Apple\u2019s following update:\n> Anyway, the follow-up release, iOS 18.5, is where the good stuff is supposed to wind up. It has the AI-infused Siri that the company showed off last June, as well as support for Apple Intelligence in China.\nTypically, a point update so late in an iOS release cycle won\u2019t have many notable new features.\nWith iOS 18.5, however, there are two big ones:\n  1. the Siri upgrades we\u2019ve been waiting for\n  2. and Apple Intelligence support in China\n\n\n## #1: Siri upgrades\nSiri changes will enable Apple\u2019s assistant to do all the things that were demoed last year at WWDC, and that many users had expected to be available already\u2014since Apple already promoted them in ads.\nFor example, Siri will support hundreds of new in-app and cross-app actions. This will make it far more powerful than before, letting you perform many actions by voice that you previously needed to open an app for.\nOn-screen awareness is another upgrade coming. It lets Siri understand what you\u2019re looking at on your device and perform actions based on items on-screen.\nFinally, Siri will also understand your personal context. This means Siri will be able to behave much more like a human assistant. Ask it questions about your previous meetings, texts or emails you were sent, places you\u2019ve been recently, and so on, and Siri will be able to answer those questions with true intelligence about your life.\nApple has been making Siri changes gradually in its recent updates, but iOS 18.5 should finally get us to the point where it feels like the \u201cnew era for Siri\u201d has actually arrived.\n## #2: Apple Intelligence in China\nThe majority of our readers may not be impacted by this, but Apple Intelligence\u2019s arrival in China will address one of Apple\u2019s biggest current problems.\nWith fierce competition from local smartphone makers, all of whom offer their own AI support, bringing Apple Intelligence to China has become an urgent necessity for Apple.\niPhone sales in China have been struggling recently, but Tim Cook told investors not to worry. \nPart of his case for optimism was that Apple Intelligence had not yet launched in the region, and iPhone sales have performed stronger where AI features are available.\nSo naturally, the arrival of Apple Intelligence support in iOS 18.5 should\u2014assuming existing trends hold\u2014help boost sales in one of Apple\u2019s most important markets.\n## iOS 18.5 release timing and wrap-up\nCurrently, Mark Gurman expects Apple to ship iOS 18.5 with these new features **_some time in May_**.\nThough with iOS 18.4 coming not long before in early April, it\u2019s very possible that it could slip into early June instead. The important thing is for Apple to get it out the door before WWDC 2025 kicks off.\nDo you expect iOS 18.5 to make a big impact on users? Why or why not?

Their , published in _Chem_ , describes a novel light-driven reaction that efficiently produces tetrahydroisoquinolines, a group of chemicals that play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry.\nTetrahydroisoquinolines serve as the foundation for treatments targeting Parkinson's disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. These compounds are commonly found in medications such as painkillers and drugs for high blood pressure, as well as in natural sources like certain plants and marine organisms.\nTraditionally, chemists have relied on well-established but limiting methods to synthesize these molecules. The new research, co-authored by Kevin Brown, the James F. Jackson Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, and Professors Xiaotian Qi, Wang Wang, and Bodi Zhao of Wuhan University, presents a fundamentally different approach.\n## How it works: Light as a chemical tool\nInstead of using traditional chemical reactions, scientists harness light to trigger a process called photoinduced energy transfer, wherein light initiates a controlled reaction between sulfonylimines (a type of chemical compound) and alkenes (another type of compound), leading to the creation of tetrahydroisoquinolines\u2014a type of complex molecule. This method allows for the development of new structural patterns in the molecules, which were previously difficult or impossible to create using other methods, offering a more efficient way to make complex molecules.\n\"The key innovation in this study is the use of a light-activated catalyst, a special molecule that speeds up the reaction without being used up itself,\" said Professor Brown. \"Traditional methods require high temperatures or strong acids\u2014like trying to cook food with a blowtorch instead of a stove. These harsh conditions can sometimes create unwanted side reactions, or make the process less useful for certain chemicals. The new process, however, uses molecules that respond to light, and can bypass heating by access new energy states. This makes the reaction cleaner, more efficient, and less likely to create unwanted byproducts.\"\nBrown and colleagues also found that tiny changes in the location of electrons within the starting materials had a huge impact on how the reaction played out\u2014akin to if these electrons were puzzle pieces that needed to fit together just right. By tweaking the shapes of these pieces, the scientists made sure that only the desired product was formed, making the process highly selective. This is crucial for making medicines, where even a small mistake in a molecule's structure can turn a helpful drug into something useless or even harmful.\n## Implications for medicine and other industries\n\"The ability to create a wider range of tetrahydroisoquinoline-based molecules means that medicinal chemists can now explore new drug candidates for treating diseases like Parkinson's, certain types of cancer, and heart conditions,\" noted Professor Qi. \"Right now, some diseases have very few effective treatment options, and this method could help scientists discover new and better drugs more quickly.\"\nBeyond pharmaceuticals, this research could also impact other industries that rely on fine chemicals. In agriculture, for example, similar chemical reactions could be used to develop more effective pesticides or fertilizers. In materials science, it could help create new synthetic materials with specific properties, such as better durability and longevity and greater resistance to heat for the aerospace, automotive, electronics, and medical industries.\nThe researchers plan to fine-tune the reaction conditions, meaning, they will experiment with different ingredients and settings to make the improve the process further. They also aim to find out if this method can work on even more types of molecules, expanding its usefulness. In addition, they hope to partner with pharmaceutical companies to test whether this technique can be used to produce medicines, potentially leading to new drug discoveries that could make a difference in people's lives.\n\"This approach gives chemists a powerful new tool,\" said Professor Brown. \"We hope especially it will open the door to the development of new and improved therapies for patients around the world.\"\nAs the field of photochemistry continues to expand, innovations like this may redefine how medicines and essential chemicals are made, paving the way for faster, cleaner, and more efficient production methods.\n**More information:** Wang Wang et al, An unconventional photochemical tetrahydroisoquinoline synthesis from sulfonylimines and alkenes, _Chem_ (2025). \n**Journal information:** Chem\nProvided by Indiana University\n**Citation** : Researchers pioneer groundbreaking light-driven method to create key drug compounds (2025, March 22) retrieved 24 March 2025 from https://phys.org/news/2025-03-groundbreaking-driven-method-key-drug.html \nThis document is subject to copyright.

While that isn\u2019t a surprise, it does mean that many of its roadmapped features are being delayed, and technical challenges are resulting in certain features, including the \u2018more conversational\u2019 Siri update \u2013 shipping later.\n## Conversational Siri delays\nLate last year, Gurman reported that Apple was working on an all new \u2018LLM Siri\u2019 for iOS 19. This system would merge the two backends for Siri that we currently have today, into one new and unified architecture. Currently, Siri has two entirely separate backends: one for simpler requests and one for more complex requests.\nLuckily, \u2018LLM Siri\u2019 and its new architecture is still on track to launch with iOS 19. However, it was supposed to be accompanied by a more conversational approach, something more like ChatGPT. Gurman says that is running behind schedule, and will no longer be unveiled in June. \nFurthermore, Gurman says that employees within Apple\u2019s AI division now believe that a more conversational version of Siri won\u2019t reach consumers until iOS 20 \u2018at best\u2019.\nAs for the three Siri features anticipated to debut in iOS 18, Gurman says Apple is still on track to release these features in May with iOS 18.5.\n## Apple Intelligence in iOS 19\nGurman reports that internal Apple data indicates that real world usage of Apple Intelligence is \u2018extremely low\u2019. This would suggest that the current feature set isn\u2019t necessarily resonating with consumers.\n## Top comment by Chris\nLiked by 9 people \n> Gurman reports that internal Apple data indicates that real world usage of Apple Intelligence is \u2018extremely low\u2019.\nSomehow that doesn\u2019t surprise me at all, the features they have launched are terribly basic (the writing features are \u2018footnotes\u2019 in the list of AI stuff on the S25 line for example, certainly not headline features), and these features feel like they were launched because they are the easiest to do, rather than the ones that would be most useful to consumers.\nView all comments\nDespite that, Gurman reports that Apple Intelligence might not necessarily include many improvements in iOS 19:\n> Everything I\u2019ve heard suggests that iOS 19 will not include any significant consumer-facing changes to Apple Intelligence. A big reason for that is the amount of time Apple is still spending working to get the features announced last year out the door. It\u2019s challenging to move on to next year\u2019s release before this year\u2019s operating system updates have rolled out to customers.\nThis is quite disappointing, but it makes sense given how far behind they are when it comes to releasing its promised Siri improvements. If this report holds up, this means we won\u2019t see meaningful new Apple Intelligence features until iOS 20 debuts in June of 2027.\n**My favorite iPhone accessories on Amazon:**\n_Follow Michael: , ,_\n_FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links._ More.\nYou\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

The agency has already laid off hundreds of employees since last week, as part of an ongoing Reduction in Force (RIF).\nGSA Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian told employees in an email that the Office of Personnel Management approved its request for Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) to all eligible employees, \u201cincluding those impacted by the RIF.\u201d\n\u201cVERA is a strictly voluntary option that allows eligible employees to retire early and is often used by agencies undergoing reductions and restructuring as a means of achieving their workforce goals with less disruption to individuals and work units,\u201d Ehikian wrote in the email obtained by Federal News Network.\nGSA has also asked OPM for approval to offer Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIPs) to eligible employees. Ehikian wrote that he\u2019s \u201coptimistic about it being approved in the near future.\u201d\nThe maximum amount agencies can offer in a VSIP is $25,000.\nFederal employees under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) are eligible for voluntary early retirement if they\u2019re at least 50 years of age, with at least 20 years of service, or any age with at least 25 years of service.\n\u201cI encourage each of you to consider your options as we move forward,\u201d Ehikian told employees. \u201cThe new GSA will be slimmer, more efficient and laser-focused on efficiency and high-value outcomes.\u201d\nA GSA spokesperson told Federal News Network that the agency is \"pleased that OPM approved Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) to be offered to all eligible GSA employees as we continue our restructuring.\"\nThe spokesperson added that the GSA's ongoing restructuring is in support on a recent executive order signed by President Donald Trump.\nGSA's Office of Human Resources Management, he added, will send additional information on the VERA, eligibility requirements and VSIP updates.\nThe agency laid off about 600 employees on March 3, and continues to terminate additional personnel.\nGSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service, which manages a governmentwide portfolio of leased and owned federal office buildings, has felt the brunt of these workforce reductions. Agency leaders expect to cut 63% of its workforce.\nLast week, GSA began terminating employees across its 11 regional offices. The agency on March 5 announced major layoffs in its region 10 office, which generally covers the Pacific Northwest.\n\u201cEvery single region has reported mass RIFs now, but no one in leadership is disseminating info on it,\u201d one GSA employee told Federal News Network. \u201cWe are getting updates from an offline GSA employee group chat and just trading info at this point.\u201d\nFedScoop first reported last week that GSA also plans to cut its Technology Transformation Staff by 50%.\nEhikian wrote in his email that GSA \u201chas initiated significant reductions and restructuring across several business units to gain efficiencies, eliminate redundancy, and improve alignment with Administration and agency priorities.\u201d\n\u201cI offer my sincere and heartfelt gratitude for the work of all GSA employees impacted by these decisions. I am working closely with senior leaders across GSA to reshape and refocus organizational units as quickly as possible following these departures. I am confident that these changes will return GSA to our founding principles of ensuring the federal government operates with efficiency, fiscal responsibility, and accountability,\u201d he wrote.\nOther agencies are taking a similar approach to cut staffing.\nThe Social Security Administration told staff last month it\u2019s offering voluntary early retirements and VSIPs worth up to $25,000, with the goal of reducing its workforce by about 7,000 employees. SSA already has its lowest headcount in more than 50 years.\nThe Associated Press reported Monday that the Department of Health and Human Services sent a similar \u201cvoluntary separation offer\u201d to more than 80,000 of its employees.\nThe post GSA offers voluntary early retirements amid widespread layoffs first appeared on Federal News Network.", "title": "GSA Administrator Stephen Ehikian implements voluntary early retirements and separation incentives under Trump's executive order, mirroring workforce cuts across federal agencies like SSA and HHS.", "summary": "The General Services Administration (GSA) is offering voluntary early retirement to eligible employees, with potential lump-sum payments of up to $25,000, as part of its ongoing Reduction in Force (RIF).

That\u2019s a massive gap, and Apple might be the best company to fill it as every Apple device comes with biometrics out of the box.\nSome of my favorite gear \n**About Apple @ Work:** Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 1000s of Macs, and 1000s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments.\nTouch ID/Face ID has been on the iPhone around for 11 years at this point, and it\u2019s been available on the Mac since 2016. Today, every iPad, Mac, and iPhone includes biometrics that are out of the box. But here\u2019s the real question: If IT leaders already know biometrics are the way forward, why aren\u2019t Apple\u2019s authentication systems becoming the default for enterprise security?\n## Passwords are the weak link\u2014and IT teams know it\nIf there\u2019s one thing IT teams agree on, it\u2019s that passwords are a problem as they\u2019re ripe for phishing. Apple has been heavily pushing passkey across macOS and iOS, a passwordless authentication method (from the ) that relies on biometrics or a device-based key. The FIDO Alliance has been working with major device manufacturers and password managers to continue improving the standard (portability is coming soon). Meanwhile, enterprise IT teams struggle with weak passwords, multi-factor authentication fatigue, and rising security threats.\nThe report also notes that AI-driven cyberattacks are rising, and poorly managed passwords remain an easy target for hackers. IT teams know this, but they\u2019re still playing catch-up when deploying better security tools. 98% of the people surveyed report using password-based systems for at least some IT resources.\nSome of my favorite gear \nIf biometric security is the future, Apple already has the pieces to win. Touch ID is standard for desktop users on MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard. It\u2019s fast, secure, and tied to Apple\u2019s Secure Enclave, which keeps biometric data locked away from potential attacks and stays local to the device. For many years, I\u2019ve said that Apple\u2019s not trying to sync biometric data across iCloud strategically was an incredible decision in hindsight.\nThe data is clear, though. IT admins want biometrics to improve their security posture, but many companies still buy and deploy devices that don\u2019t support them. In my opinion, that\u2019s a strategic mistake. With Apple Silicon Macs gaining traction in the enterprise, 2025 is the time for IT leaders to start prioritizing hardware that makes biometrics work great for IT and the end user. Buying devices without biometrics in 2025 is ignoring what\u2019s best for security.\nOne thing I\u2019d like Apple to begin thinking about in the long term is making biometrics always available, even if you restart the Mac. We need biometrics 100% of the time to move to a passwordless world.\nJumpCloud\u2019s report makes it obvious: IT teams know biometrics are the future, but they\u2019re not rolling them out fast enough. Apple is already ahead of the game with Touch ID, Face ID, Secure Enclave, and passkeys\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of enterprise IT catching up with their buying strategy. Apple is well-positioned to continue strong enterprise growth because of this. \nSome of my favorite gear \nYou can download the full report \n_, the only Apple Unified Platform.

Read on as we break down all the numbers below.\n## Comparing the iPhone 16e battery with the rest of the lineup\nTypically, Apple doesn\u2019t discuss mAh battery numbers. Instead, the company says how long the battery lasts in specific situations such as watching videos offline or via streaming. However, thanks to , we now know the exact internal battery capacity of the brand new iPhone 16e, and it\u2019s surprisingly big.\nAccording to Lee, the iPhone 16e has a battery capacity of 3961 mAh. The figure is higher than the battery in the base iPhone 16 model, for example.\n  * iPhone 16: 3561 mAh\n  * iPhone 16 Plus: 4674 mAh\n  * **iPhone 16e:~~3961 mAh~~** (a new teardown revealed that the battery has **4005 mAh**)\n  * iPhone 16 Pro: 3582 mAh\n  * iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4685 mAh\n\n\nThe battery is also bigger than the one inside the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14, with 3349 mAh and 3279 mAh respectively.\nAnd here\u2019s how Apple compares the battery of the iPhone 16 lineup:\n  * iPhone 16: Up to 18 hours of streaming video or 22 hours of offline video\n  * iPhone 16 Plus: Up to 24 hours of streaming video or 27 hours of offline video\n  * **iPhone 16e: Up to 21 hours of streaming video or 26 hours of offline video**\n  * iPhone 16 Pro: Up to 22 hours of streaming video or 27 hours of offline video\n  * iPhone 16 Pro Max: Up to 29 hours of streaming video or 33 hours of offline video\n\n\nThe difference from the now-discontinued iPhone SE 3 is even more significant, as the device\u2019s internal battery only had a capacity of 2018 mAh. The iPhone SE 3 only had enough battery for up to 10 hours of streaming video or 15 hours of offline video.\nAccording to , the iPhone 16e \u201chad no problem lasting well longer than 24 hours\u201d unplugged. also agrees that the phone has a \u201creally good battery.\u201d\nBut having a decent internal battery isn\u2019t the only thing that helps the iPhone 16e\u2019s battery last longer. An important component of this new iPhone is the C1 chip, Apple\u2019s first 5G modem. The company says that the new modem uses much less energy than the modems used in other iPhones, which has already been proven by lab tests.\n> In the high signal strength conditions, average power draw for the iPhone 16 on 5G was 0.88 watts, compared with just 0.67 watts on the iPhone 16e \u2026 a difference of about 24%. In the low signal test, average power draw was 0.81 watts and 0.67 watts respectively, a difference of about 17%.\niPhone 16e is now available to order with prices starting at $599 for the 128GB version.

A second round of payouts begun toward the end of 2023, and now the third and final round of payments started going out this week.\n## Previous payouts\nAs part of a settlement agreement, Apple established the Small Developer Assistance Fund in 2021. It offered payouts of $250 to $30,000 to any developer who had paid any commission to Apple between June 4, 2015 and April 26, 2021. The total settlement was over $100,000,000, benefiting over 99% of US app developers.\nThe payment tiers broke down as follows:\n  * Under $100 in annual App Store proceeds: $250 minimum payout\n  * $100-$1,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $500 minimum payout\n  * $1,000-$5,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $1,000 minimum payout\n  * $5,000-$10,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $1,500 minimum payout\n  * $10,000-$50,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $2,000 minimum payout\n  * $50,000-$100,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $3,500 minimum payout\n  * $100,000-$250,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $5,000 minimum payout\n  * $250,000-$500,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $10,000 minimum payout\n  * $500,000-$1,000,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $20,000 minimum payout\n  * Over $1,000,000 in annual App Store proceeds: $30,000 minimum payout\n\n\nWith the initial round of payouts in October 2022, since fewer people filed than anticipated \u2013 the payouts ended up being roughly 4x the minimum payout. That means for some developers, the settlement payout exceeded what they actually would\u2019ve earned. For example, developers in the $100-1000 annual income tier received a settlement check exceeding $2000.\nIn late 2023, a second round of payouts went out, distributing any unclaimed funds from developers who were unable to provide a valid tax identification number. That payout was $17 for those who earned under $100, and $34 for those who earned under $1000. If you wish, you can do the math to figure out what that payout meant for each tier. The max payout here was around ~$2040.\n## Final payout\nStarting this week, developers begun receiving checks, E-MasterCards, and PayPal payments for the third and final payout from the Small Developer Assistance Fund. It was in the amount of $20.19 for those who earned under $100, and $40.39 for those who earned under $1000. That means payouts presumably go as high as ~$2422 for those developers who earned over $1,000,000 a year.\nSo, if you\u2019re an indie app developer who participated in this class action settlement \u2013 keep an eye on your mailbox! These checks will be void on April 21st, 2025.\n**My favorite iPhone accessories on Amazon:**\n_Follow Michael: , ,_\n_FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links._ More.\nYou\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

The DA's Office said the woman was left with lacerations to her scalp and a full-thickness laceration to her lip, requiring 17 sutures and five staples, and leaving her permanently disfigured. \nThe victim, who moved out of California after the attack, urged the judge to impose a prison sentence and gave the following statement to the court Wednesday before Colombano was sentenced:\n> \"When you have a stranger attack you in the way I was attacked, it felt like my ability to be strong was taken away from me. I have cried more in the last six months than I have in my entire lifetime ... my daughter and my little cousin, both thirteen at the time, had to witness the whole thing ... I cannot even put into words the feeling of not being able to protect yourself or your child at the same time.\" \nThe DA's Office had asked that Colombano be sentenced to the maximum prison sentence of nine years, in addition to 18 months in county jail, and the office made no sentencing agreements following his plea.

Her daughter and niece's sense of safety and well-being will never be the same. Mr. Colombano is a menace to public safety, period, and should be sitting in prison. That won't happen. As there is no further action legally allowable for our office, the community, and more importantly, the victims will have to live with the consequences of this sentence.

Similar to the existing Critical-level notifications, they\u2019re expected to be rarely deployed only for very important, time-sensitive notices.\nIf you do find yourself receiving Critical Messages you don\u2019t want, there\u2019s an opt-out option in iOS that can be applied to individual apps. \nTo opt out, simply open your iPhone\u2019s Settings app, then go to Privacy & Security \u21fe Critical Messages. Any apps that have requested permission to send these types of messages will appear here and can be disabled.\nWhat do you think of the iPhone\u2019s Critical Messages feature?

They worked great with HomeKit Secure Video, but they also worked great as HomeKit motion sensors and recording back to the eufy base station. Overall, I had zero complaints.

However, if you only watch and store it in the HomeKit/Home app, it\u2019s capped at 1080p. Apple hasn\u2019t brought 4K support to HomeKit at this time. \nKeeping with that theme, this camera can do a lot:\n  * Pan/Title\n  * 4k support\n  * Pet tracking\n  * Recording to SD card\n  * No subscription fees \n\n\nAll of these work awesome, but they don\u2019t work in the Home app. These are all features that Apple should at least be able to do if the camera supports it. If you want to use some of the eufy E30\u2019s incredible features, you\u2019ll have to use . You can use the eufy app alongside HomeKit, though. You can use HomeKit for the recording, but then still leverage some of the built-in camera technology. if you _only_ want to use HomeKit/Home app, though, you\u2019ll basically get a really good standalone 1080p camera with night vision. \nSome of my favorite gear \n## Adding the eufy E30 to HomeKit\nFor cameras, I want to see it be a HomeKit-only experience and the eufy E30 delivers. There\u2019s a HomeKit code on the camera, and you can completely onboard it to HomeKit and HomeKit Secure Video without ever setting up an account with eufy. \nOver the years, products have gotten better and better about is how fast and error-free they are when onboarding to HomeKit. No resets, no errors, and in 3 minutes, it was working and showing video in the Home app.\nThe eufy E30 will work great as a baby monitor, indoor camera looking at one of your exterior doors, or really anywhere. Because it can be leveraged as a HomeKit motion sensor, you can use it to trigger other HomeKt devices like lights, etc.\n## Wrap up\nAlthough many of the eufy E30\u2019s headline features are not compatible with HomeKit, it is totally possible to set it to record in HomeKit and then use the eufy app to access some of the advanced features. Eufy makes solid HomeKit cameras, and the eufy E30 is no exception.\nSome of my favorite gear \nYou can buy it from or directly from .\n_FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links._ More.\nYou\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

Regularly $99, you can now score four of them \u2013 that\u2019s 35% off and a new Amazon all-time low to deliver a price at just over $16 per AirTag.\nWhile Amazon still has its down from $29 to (within a few bucks of the lowest price to date), the 4-pack has never sold for any less than this. In fact, we have never tracked the 4-pack down this low from any retailer ever outside of some extremely limited YMMV deals that very few folks would have had a shot at. Black Friday sales at the end of 2024 had this bundle package going for $69, for the record.\nAll things considered, at just over $16 per AirTag here, you\u2019re looking at prices much closer to a third-party Find My tag from a budget brand.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s AirTag remain atop the list of the best item trackers out there to this day. They also just received a notable software update in the form of the new \u201cShare Item Location\u201d feature \u2013 it allows users to enlist the help of trusted friends and businesses () to track down their misplaced AirTag (and the gear it is attached to). The complete .\nAirTag 2 is at some point this year with better range and an improved ultrawide band chip, which is quite possibly the reason we are seeing such a fantastic deal here today. But the AirTag on sale right now remains the best in the business and there\u2019s no denying the price tag here at just over $16 a pop.\n## Hello!

The price even without it is already rock-bottom so it\u2019s not a huge deal, but at $15 and $25 a pop here, we are talking about the lowest prices we have ever tracked.\nYou will find a available on these official Apple Solo Loops, ranging through shades of greens and blues as well as reds, oranges, yellows, and more neutral options \u2013 black, gray, tan, and so on.

While we have seen the as low as $1,699 in the past, that was indeed a doorbuster offer and it hasn\u2019t dropped below $1,749 since \u2013 it is currently on sale for at Amazon.\nThat leaves the aforementioned entry-level M4 MacBook Pro as the closest option in terms of price and specs. Again, it all goes back to how much you value the internal storage upgrade here. Is double the storage worth spending an extra $190 for you? For me it isn\u2019t, and in this case I would go with the sweet deal still live on the instead, but some folks like to have the expanded storage capacity built-in and the price is right here as far as Apple\u2019s internal SSD options go.\n## Apple 15-inch \n## Launch deal now live \n## Belkin\u2019s Apple MagSafe Duo-style \n## Today\u2019s accessories and charging deals:\n## Official M4 iPad Pro \n## Apple Pencil Pro \n## Just about every \n## Best Buy launches \n## Level\u2019s ultra-discreet \n## Nomad launches official overstock sale at up to 50% off: iPhone 16 cases, Apple Watch bands, accessories, more from $13\nWhile we did happen to coincidentally spot some of these deals popping yesterday (that is what we do after all), Nomad has now featuring a number of its newer releases for iPhone 16 alongside some bundle offers that combine its wonderful MagSafe chargers with its premium cables and wall chargers too.

Here are the details.\n## Skype users being encouraged to switch to Teams before May 5 deadline\nSkype is shutting down May 5, leaving users about two months to migrate data over to Teams or find another platform altogether.\nAccording to Jeff Teper, Microsoft president overseeing communications and collaboration tools, the need for increased AI investment is a big reason why Skype is being retired.\n:\n> The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn\u2019t part of that effort. It\u2019s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.\nAccording to _Bloomberg_ , while Skype once had over 300 million monthly users in 2016, that number shrank to around 36 million by 2023 as Microsoft Teams has grown.\n## 9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nSkype was one of the major losers of the 2020 COVID era that brought big success to companies like Zoom and Slack. Already at the time Microsoft was investing heavily in Teams, so Skype, despite its past success, was largely left to flounder.\nMicrosoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, which is not that long ago in the grand scheme of things. \nPer the company, Skype helped set a foundation that was built upon with Teams. So in that sense, its downfall is less a story of failure and more one of preparing the way for the more modern Teams platform to emerge.\nWhen was the last time you used Skype?

We help you keep up._ OpenAI has officially unveiled GPT-4.5, the latest version of the fastest ChatGPT model. While GPT-4.5 excels in a number of areas including accuracy and emotional intelligence, OpenAI emphasizes that GPT-4.5 is not its most advanced model for now.\n## GPT-4.5 is smarter, warmer, and not yet available for everyone \nOpenAI knows that its various models and model names are confusing. GPT-4.5 isn\u2019t here to help. In fact, while GPT-4.5 is the newest model release, OpenAI says that its o3 reasoning model remains its most powerful. It describes GPT-4.5 as a research preview and not a frontier model.\nLater this year, OpenAI expects to introduce GPT-5 as a single that handles quick chat requests and more intensive reasoning requests without switching models. \nFor now, GPT-4.5 is here to replace GPT-4o with more accuracy, fewer hallucinations, and higher emotional intelligence. The latter quality is something for which Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot has been praised compared to ChatGPT\u2019s less natural responses.\nFor example, GPT-4.5 may invite users to continue a conversation rather than simply provide detailed information as a response. The new model is also more succinct and conversational, .\nStarting today, GPT-4.5 is available to Pro subscribers in the $200/month plan, but the new model is coming to more users starting next year. OpenAI says it will start rolling out GPT-4.5 to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) and Team subscribers next week, followed by Enterprise and Edu users the following week.\nWatch the 13-minute livestream reveal below:\nFor a deeper dive, you can read OpenAI\u2019s 30-page system card on GPT-4.5 .\n## Beyond OpenAI\nWhile OpenAI continues to forge ahead, former key players at OpenAI that left the company have founded new startups that are raising money and building new AI tools.\n**Mira Murati** , the former Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI, recently announced her AI startup called **Thinking Machines Lab**. Murati has brought along more than 30 experts from OpenAI, Meta, and Google DeepMind.\nCo-founder Lilian Weng previously served as Vice President of AI safety and robotics as well as applied research at OpenAI. John Schulman, another OpenAI co-founder, joined Thinking Machines from Anthropic where he served as a researcher.\nThinking Machines Lab is focused on multimodal AI models and products that are accessible with practical applications.\nHere\u2019s how Thinking Machines Lab its focus in part:\n> While AI capabilities have advanced dramatically, key gaps remain. The scientific community\u2019s understanding of frontier AI systems lags behind rapidly advancing capabilities. Knowledge of how these systems are trained is concentrated within the top research labs, limiting both the public discourse on AI and people\u2019s abilities to use AI effectively. And, despite their potential, these systems remain difficult for people to customize to their specific needs and values. To bridge the gaps, we\u2019re building Thinking Machines Lab to make AI systems more widely understood, customizable and generally capable. [\u2026]\n> Emphasis on human-AI collaboration. Instead of focusing solely on making fully autonomous AI systems, we are excited to build multimodal systems that work with people collaboratively.\n> More flexible, adaptable, and personalized AI systems. We see enormous potential for AI to help in every field of work. While current systems excel at programming and mathematics, we\u2019re building AI that can adapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and enable a broader spectrum of applications.\nThe company is seeking to raise $1 billion at a $9 billion valuation, according to .\n**Ilya Sutskever** , former OpenAI chief scientist, co-founded another AI startup called **Safe Superintelligence** with ex-OpenAI researcher Daniel Levy and former Apple AI projects lead Daniel Gross.\nHere\u2019s how SSI its purpose:\n> Building safe superintelligence (SSI) is the most important technical problem of our\u200b\u200b time.\n> We have started the world\u2019s first straight-shot SSI lab, with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.\n> It\u2019s called Safe Superintelligence Inc.\n> SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and business model are all aligned to achieve SSI.\n> We approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains ahead.\n> This way, we can scale in peace.\nSSI its first $1 billion in September 2024. More recently, SSI has been seeking an additional $1 billion at a $30 billion market valuation.\nA third AI startup from a former OpenAI veteran to have on your radar is **Eureka Labs** , which is creating an AI-native educational platform. Former OpenAI research scientist and founding member **Andrej Karpathy** has been building Eureka Labs since 2024. He currently served as director of AI at Tesla.\nThe startup its mission and first product-in-development in July 2024:\n> We are Eureka Labs and we are building a new kind of school that is AI native.\n> How can we approach an ideal experience for learning something new? For example, in the case of physics one could imagine working through very high quality course materials together with Feynman, who is there to guide you every step of the way. Unfortunately, subject matter experts who are deeply passionate, great at teaching, infinitely patient and fluent in all of the world\u2019s languages are also very scarce and cannot personally tutor all 8 billion of us on demand.\n> However, with recent progress in generative AI, this learning experience feels tractable. The teacher still designs the course materials, but they are supported, leveraged and scaled with an AI Teaching Assistant who is optimized to help guide the students through them. This Teacher + AI symbiosis could run an entire curriculum of courses on a common platform. If we are successful, it will be easy for anyone to learn anything, expanding education in both reach (a large number of people learning something) and extent (any one person learning a large amount of subjects, beyond what may be possible today unassisted).\n> Our first product will be the world\u2019s obviously best AI course, . This is an undergraduate-level class that guides the student through training their own AI, very similar to a smaller version of the AI Teaching Assistant itself. The course materials will be available online, but we also plan to run both digital and physical cohorts of people going through it together.\n> Today, we are heads down building LLM101n, but we look forward to a future where AI is a key technology for increasing human potential.\nMore to come for Eureka Labs. In the meantime, Karpathy regularly shares his knowledge in course-length videos on YouTube:\n## Meta is making a standalone AI app\nLastly, Meta is reportedly developing a standalone AI app that will debut as soon as Q2 this year. CNBC reports:\n> The company intends to debut a Meta AI standalone app during the second quarter, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a major step in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s plans to make his company the leader in artificial intelligence by the end of the year, ahead of competitors such as OpenAI and Alphabet, said the people, who asked not to be named because the project is confidential.\nNews of Meta possibly focusing its AI efforts into a standalone app and not just inside of Facebook and WhatsApp prompted OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman to quip on X, \u201cok fine maybe we\u2019ll do a social app.\u201d\nMore on the latest in AI developments in the next edition of **Neural **\u2014 only on 9to5Mac!

While I didn\u2019t dive in during the X.10 days, I\u2019ve been using a variety of smart home devices for well over a decade now, and jumped in on HomeKit as soon as it crossed the Atlantic.\nBut a recent experience of something as simple as replacing a failed light-bulb really drove home how much further we have to go before we can expect non-techies to climb on board \u2026\nOne of my Philips Hue color ambiance bulbs failed a couple of days ago. It was probably more than 10 years old by then, having been moved between two or three different lamps, so I didn\u2019t consider that too unreasonable a lifespan.\nNo problem, I thought, I\u2019ll just order a replacement and be up-and-running again within a couple of minutes. The new bulb duly arrived, I opened the Home app, selected the room, tapped the + button, selected Add Accessory and the code scan window opened.\nI had a very vague and possibly incorrect recollection that the last time I did this a long time ago it was a conventional barcode we scanned, but the app clearly told me to scan the QR code. \nSo, I tried to scan the QR code printed on the bulb itself. The Home app made a number of attempts at identifying it, briefly showing white boxes in a variety of sizes, shapes, and angles, but no luck.\nI went very close, to fill the frame. Nada. I backed right out. Nope.\nI dug the Quick Start guide out, which was interesting as I\u2019d ordered a twin-pack in order to have a spare, and there was just a single guide with a single QR code. But the leaflet said to scan it, so \u2026\nNope \u2013 just a repeat of the bulb-scanning experience.\nI\u2019ve been doing this stuff a long time, so just rolled my eyes and went to plan C: plugging it into the lamp, opening the Hue app, waiting for that to find it, and then finally adding it to the Home app. But it reminded me that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve _ever_ had a quick, slick, It Just Works experience with anything smart home related. Pretty much every device I\u2019ve ever added to my home has required the ritual sacrifice of at least one goat.\nThis is the problem we still need to fix with smart home kit. It\u2019s utterly ridiculous that it\u2019s this hard to _change a lightbulb_ , FFS!\nIt\u2019s the problem Apple promised to fix with HomeKit, but didn\u2019t. It\u2019s the problem the company _really_ needs to solve if it ever hopes to persuade normals to buy into smart homes.\nTo be fair, the company is aware of this. A patent application published five years ago described an approach to smart home devices which can completely configure themselves, with the only job of the user being to grant permission.\nApple cameras would use Apple Intelligence to scan your home, identify objects like sofas and cookers, use those to label each room \u2013 and then intelligently add devices to the network.\nPlug that new smart bulb into a living room lamp, and the system would say to itself \u201cAha, that\u2019s been added to a lamp in the living room, and the previous bulb there was named Living Room Table Lamp, so I\u2019ll just name it and configure it to match the previous bulb, and add it to all the same scenes.\u201d\nIf it\u2019s instead added to a new lamp, the system would think \u201cOk, this has been added to a floor lamp in the dining room, so I\u2019ll provisionally call it Dining Room Floor Lamp and ask the homeowner to confirm and advise whether they want to add it to the two living room scenes they have.\u201d\nA good first step would be to apply this kind of intelligence to the Apple-branded smart home products we\u2019re expecting to see launched \u2013 but equally important will be the Cupertino company offering this to the Connectivity Standards Alliance for inclusion in the Matter standard. Apple has form for occasional acts of industry altruism of this kind, such as allowing the Qi2 standard to be based on MagSafe.\nWith that approach implemented, changing a smart light bulb would be as easy as, well, changing a light-bulb.\n_Photo: Philips/Signify_\n_FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links._ More.\nYou\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

I\u2019ve been hoping that Apple would get around to fixing it for the longest time, but they haven\u2019t thus far.\nEssentially, if you send an AVIF image file on iMessage, it won\u2019t render properly. AVIF is an increasingly popular image format, so it\u2019s a little annoying.\nHowever, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019d be one thing if Apple just didn\u2019t support the file format. But, for some bizarre reason, it shows in a small window, with no way of expanding the preview.

There\u2019s just no way to properly view them.\nThis experience is weird, and I sincerely hope Apple gets around to fixing it soon. AVIFs are supported in Safari and Photos, so there\u2019s nothing stopping users from sending them on iMessage.

Today: Apple\u2019s foldable iPhone breakthrough, the AirTag 2 release window narrows, iPhone 17 Pro and 17e reports, and more. Here are this week\u2019s Apple rumors.\n## AirTag 2 release window narrows\nThis week leaker Kosutami posted on X about when to expect the AirTag 2 to release. We had previously heard it should arrive by mid-year, but that was a fairly large window.\nAccording to the new report, AirTag 2 will launch in **_either May or June_**.\n### My takeaways\nIt\u2019s good to get a better idea of when to expect Apple\u2019s AirTag successor. Amazon keeps running , so I had wondered if AirTag 2 might arrive sooner rather than later. But it seems Apple still needs to clear existing inventory before launching the new AirTag.\n## Foldable iPhone breakthrough and another new design\nThis week brought two reports on Apple\u2019s foldable iPhone. One reiterated that 2026 remains the planned launch date, while the other mentioned a big breakthrough for Apple: it has reportedly made the foldable\u2019s crease virtually invisible.\nOn a related note, Mark Gurman teased that 2026\u2019s foldable won\u2019t have the only new iPhone design coming. He wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s also another new iPhone design in the works for that year, I\u2019m told.\u201d\n### My takeaways\nThere\u2019s still plenty of time for Apple\u2019s plans to change, but the closer we get to 2026, the more likely it seems that a foldable iPhone is indeed coming soon. I\u2019m especially excited to hear\u2014though not surprised\u2014that the device\u2019s crease is largely invisible. Between this and the iPhone 17 Air it will be a couple very exciting years for Apple\u2019s flagship product.\nGurman\u2019s comment about \u201canother new iPhone design\u201d raises lots of questions. It could be as simple as the base iPhone 18 getting a refreshed design, since changes on this year\u2019s iPhone 17 won\u2019t be very drastic. But the way he phrased it, Gurman sounds like he\u2019s saying we should expect another new iPhone form factor\u2014along the lines of the foldable. I can\u2019t imagine what that might be, but I\u2019m fascinated to learn more.\n## iPhone 17 Pro upgrades, plus early hint of 17e model\nAccording to Mark Gurman, Apple is investing heavily in the iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s camera system with the aim of upgrading its video capabilities. The goal, per Gurman, is to \u201cget the vlogging community and other video creators to move away from standalone cameras and use the iPhone for even more of their work.\u201d Perhaps on a related note, iPhone 17 Pro models are again said to feature 12GB of RAM, a 50% increase from the current 8GB. This no doubt is tied to AI, but camera upgrades may be part of the reason too.\nMoving from the iPhone 17 high-end down to the low, Weibo leaker Fixed Focus Digital shared that there\u2019s a new project code in the iPhone supply chain that\u2019s suspected to be for an iPhone 17e model.\n### My takeaways\nApple always prioritizes making its iPhone camera system better, so Gurman\u2019s report on video upgrades makes sense. It will be interesting to see how many of the improvements come to the iPhone 17 Air too, or if they\u2019re Pro exclusives.\nAs for the rumored iPhone 17e, such a model would certainly help explain Apple abandoning the iPhone SE naming structure. I\u2019d assumed the change was simply related to the 16e being less of an \u2018SE\u2019 than it is a 16. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a new 17e model debut next year around this time either\u2014depending on how the 16e performs.\n## C-class modems built into main chip\nThe iPhone 16e\u2019s new C1 offers two key advantages over Qualcomm, but it\u2019s just the start of Apple\u2019s modem plans. Per Mark Gurman, the company aims to integrate its 5G modems into the main M- and A-class chips in the future. This change\u2014not expected before 2028\u2014\u201cshould make the electronics more energy-efficient and reduce the cost.\u201d\n### My takeaways\nI love the thought of Apple\u2019s modem getting integrated into the main device processor. As my colleague notes, this move could potentially lead to a future where all iPad models (and hopefully Macs?) automatically include the option for 5G connectivity. Eliminating the need for a paid hardware upgrade to have a cellular modem would be a great change.\nWhat are your takeaways from this week\u2019s Apple rumors?

It\u2019s been awesome to see the evolution of the Apple watch and what it is today. It\u2019s essentially a wellness computer on your wrist that is also an extension of your entire Apple Ecosystem. I wear this thing every day for many reasons, from wanting to close my rings to controlling my smart home to unlocking all my other Apple devices. It makes my life much easier just because its on my wrist. These are 10 features I wanted to share that you could easily implement. \nBefore we get started, I did want to mention that all the features I talked about will be available on all current Apple Watch models and all models that run WatchOS 11. If you are looking to upgrade Amazon always has discounted Apple Watches for sale. \nAlso, be sure to check out our hands-on video talking showcasing 20+ Apple Watch features!\n## Unlocking Mac with Apple Watch\nThis has to be one of the best ecosystem features ever. I would even say it saves you money because you don\u2019t need an Apple keyboard with TouchID. You can just use your Apple Watch to replace the biometric unlock. It\u2019s very simple.\n  * Make sure both the Mac and Watch are on the same AppleID\n  * Make sure you have a passcode enabled on your Apple Watch\n  * One your Mac head to System Settings > Login Password > check off your Apple Watch\n  * Now, whenever you need to input your Mac password, the Apple Watch unlocks it for you. \n\n\n## Apple Watch as Camera remote\nAnother one that I use all the time is the Camera Remote app on your Apple Watch. I used this feature for years on my YouTube channel to help me see where I was in the iPhone camera frame. The Camera Remote app has a few functions that are helpful:\n  * Viewfinder\n  * Digital crown to zoom\n  * Countdown timer\n  * Double Tap gesture to engage (only for Series 9 and newer & Ultra 2)\n  * Records video\n  * Switch between selfie and regular cameras\n\n\n## Ping my iPhone\nLeave a comment below if you use this feature way too often! This feature has been around for years, but some new functionality has recently been added that improves the experience significantly. As the feature name implies, you use this feature to help locate your lost iPhone if it is still connected to your Apple Watch. So, it is great if you have lost your phone in your house, at a park, or anywhere else. You access this via the control center on your Watch. You tap the ping button (shown below), and it will make your iPhone sound very loud. But now they have added the AirTag FindMy UI. Lets you really pinpoint where the phone is!\n## AppleTV Remote app\nAnother ecosystem that I use daily is the Apple TV remote app. As long as you are on the same Wi-Fi, you can control the Apple TV the same way you would use the actual remote or the remote app on your iPhone. It\u2019s a dedicated app on the Watch. I\u2019m just a fan of how easy it is to use and how they incorporate things like the digital crown for volume adjustment. I use this all the time in my living room!\n## Good morning & alarm features\nI am not sure what to call this feature, but I love it. It works in conjunction with your sleep schedule and focus modes. I use a sleep focus mode that I have set to automatically turn on at 10:30 PM and then have an alarm go off at 6:30 AM. I also sleep with my Apple Watch on for the sleep tracking data. But the first feature I want to point out is that when you have an alarm set, and you have your Apple Watch on, instead of your iPhone blasting a loud noise, the Apple Watch will vibrate to slowly and more calmly wake you up (I literally love this). It\u2019s great because it\u2019s less annoying, and it doesn\u2019t wake your partner or anyone else in the vicinity since there is no sound. \nThe second feature is that once you turn the alarm off, you get this beautiful good morning screen that gives you the temperature, the weather, the time, the date, and the battery percentage. It also shows up on your iPhone, but the Apple Watch one just looks nicer to me. \nThere is no real setting menu or option needed to turn this on; it just happens by default when you set a sleep schedule and turn on your sleep focus mode. \n## Tesla key\nThis is a pretty niche feature because you need to be a Tesla owner for this. But now the Tesla app allows you to use just your Apple Watch as a key for your Tesla. You can do all the usual things like pre-heat the car, open the trunk, lock the car, and more. The most important feature (to me), is that I can use it as the key. So I no longer need my phone or the keycard to get the car to unlock and then actually start moving. It also comes with some awesome watch complications, so if you are a Tesla owner, this has been a game changer. \n## Screenshot Apple Watch\nI use this feature often, especially when writing articles like this one. I also get this question all the time. Not many people know how to do this, but it is very simple. All you do is press the digital crown and the side button (not the action button) at the same time, and it will take a screenshot. The screen then appears in your iPhone photo gallery within 5 seconds. \n## Unlocking iPhone with Apple Watch\nThis one is a bit different than unlocking your Mac with you watch because it is never going to be the primary way to unlock your phone but it is very helpful. To turn this on:\n  * Make sure both the iPhone and Watch are on the same AppleID\n  * Make sure you have a passcode enabled on your Apple Watch\n  * Head to settings on your iPhone\n  * Scroll to FaceID & Passcode\n  * Scroll to the Apple Watch section \n  * Toggle this setting on\n\n\nThere are a few disclaimers with this. This feature is only really meant to be used as a backup if FaceID cant 100% figure out that it is you. Maybe you are wearing a mask or sunglasses or facepaint. The iPhone will try to use FaceID, but if it isn\u2019t sure, it will then use your Apple Watch as a secondary way of authenticating it, and it will unlock. As the user, there is nothing that pops up or anything; it will just unlock.\n## Palm mute\nThis is another feature that I use daily, but I don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s called. This feature allows you to completely mute or turn off anything happening on your Apple Watch just by placing your palm on the display. If you have an alarm going off and want to shut it off, you can just place your palm on it to turn it off. This works with phone calls, music, and notifications. Anything that gives you a haptic or sound alert can be shut off immediately. \n## Sleep and fitness tracking\nThese are features that I use every day. Ever since Apple started tracking sleep, I have been sleeping with my Apple watch to help collect that data. For those wondering, yes, I sleep with the Apple Watch Ultra. It is a bit bigger, but it took me about three nights to get used to it fully after coming from a Series 5 watch. One of the best things about Apple\u2019s sleep tracking is that there is no \u201cscore\u201d associated with your sleep. It just gives you the data, and you can interpret whether it was good or bad sleep. I have been testing some other sleep trackers, and they all give you a score of 100. While it\u2019s nice to see a sleep score of 91, sometimes I\u2019ll get a sleep score of 65, and it messes with my day. So, I like the way Apple has gone about it. \n## Top comment by Blurft\nLiked by 8 people \nThere are several other vehicles that support Apple's Car Key feature, including BMW, Genesis, Hyundai and Kia models. Might be worth mentioning those brands too, not just Tesla?\nView all comments\nFitness tracking can be a whole other post, but I just wanted to say that I track every workout, every run, every walk, and seeing the trend data is my absolute favorite. \n## Final take\nThe **Apple Watch Ultra,** for me, has been amazing. It solves so many small issues that I didn\u2019t think I needed solving until it did. The Apple Watch might be the one Apple product that I truly could not live without because of how much I use both passively and actively. \nWhat do you think of the Apple Watch? Which one do you have? How do you use it?

And there\u2019s one recent feature in particular that I\u2019ve long wanted, and it\u2019s made a big difference for me: integrating Reminders with the Calendar app.\n## Calendar now has a full schedule overview thanks to Reminders integration\nThe iPhone\u2019s Calendar and Reminders apps, until recently, were two entirely separate and siloed apps.\nBut with iOS 18, Apple fully baked Reminders\u2019 basic functionality into the Calendar app.\nFor me, this has been a very welcome upgrade for one main reason: now I can finally get an accurate overview of my day right inside the Calendar app.\nCalendar\u2019s integration with Reminders means you can see all scheduled reminders right alongside your calendar events.\nAnd I tend to use scheduled reminders a lot. They provide a helpful way for me to stay on top of various home tasks and work priorities.\nBefore iOS 18, if I wanted to understand what a given day\u2019s schedule looked like, I would have to open both the Calendar app and Reminders.\nLooking at Calendar alone wasn\u2019t enough, because then I\u2019d miss out on important scheduled work throughout my day.\nBut now I can see it all in just one place. \n## Top comment by Jim Schwartz\nLiked by 6 people \nthe fact that any reminders that do not get done in any given day do not carry forward......which still shows lack of functionality that is available in other task management apps (like Google Tasks)......is a deal breaker for me and shows the integration falls short (again!) \nView all comments\nAll of my scheduled reminders are listed in-line chronologically with calendar events, so with a quick glance at the Calendar app I have an instant understanding of what my full day\u2019s going to look like.\nThe only drawback: you can\u2019t currently enable only certain Reminders lists inside the Calendar app. You have to show either all scheduled reminders (regardless of list), or disable reminders entirely.\nThat limitation aside, merging Reminders with Calendar has been a fantastic change that\u2019s made a big difference in my daily use.\nDo you use Reminders inside Apple\u2019s Calendar app too?

Common sense would tell us where we should start. We start with poor performers amongst our probationary employees. We take a little bit more time to make sure, top to bottom, we're doing a review. Those who we need, who are the best and brightest, are going to stay. Those who are under performers won't. We'll continue to shoot straight with you. We've got your back,\u201d Hegseth said in a message to the force and the American public on Feb. 21.\nAfter the first round of Defense Department firings last week, the details of who was laid off \u2014 and why \u2014 are starting to emerge. Federal News Network spoke with an employee who was let go one hour before his probation period was set to end, another employee who was not in a probationary status at all, and one employee who had just started a job in warfighter support operations.\n\u201cThey are just indiscriminately firing people. There are no rules to the game,\u201d one of the fired probationary workers at the Defense Missile Agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation, told Federal News Network.\nOne Navy employee, whose name is also being withheld to protect against retaliation, was one hour away from the end of his probationary period before being terminated \u2014 unlike about a dozen probationary employees in the same role across the region who were given three weeks of administrative leave.\nIn a memo signed by Darin Selnick, who is performing the duties of the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, the Navy said he \u201chas not demonstrated that his further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\u201d\n\u201cWhat's inequitable is that you can have 11 people, and ten of them go on three weeks administrative leave, which means that they have three weeks with a clearance that they can use to get another job. They're getting paid. They have time to look for other jobs. I'm terminated that day. My leadership said it was discussed with the Department of Navy when they were trying to figure out how not to have to fire me. They said, \u201cNo, it happens today, because if he goes into another pay period, he's no longer probationary, and we can't fire him because he's a protected veteran,\u201d he said. \nHe also never received a formal performance review \u2014 he submitted self-assessments months ago, and his supervisor had completed their portion, but the commander had yet to sign off on it.\nThe memo the Navy employee received upon his termination is almost identical to the one the Defense Health Agency sent out to its fired probationary employees. \n## Firings at the Defense Health Agency\nOne of the fired DHA workers told Federal News Network she was not in a probationary status at all \u2014 she was hired at the beginning of 2023 as a GS-9, completed her probationary period in March 2024, and was promoted to GS-11 in August 2024. \nThe letter she got from HR congratulating her on her promotion last August never mentioned probationary time \u2014 her position description remained the same, but instead of assisting with certain tasks, she was now fully responsible for them.\nWhen the DHA leadership received a list of people who were in a probationary status, she was notified her name was on the list. Her leadership got involved several times to clarify with HR that there was an error, but no action was ultimately taken to correct it. \nDuring her time at DHA, she received an outstanding performance appraisal, along with time-off and monetary awards. But the memo she received, just like dozens of DHA workers fired that day, said that \u201cbased on your performance, you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\u201d\n## Defense Missile Agency layoffs\nThe Defense Missile Agency employee, who is a disabled veteran, had been with the organization since December \u2014 as a non-commissioned officer, he held a leadership role directly supporting the warfighters\u2019 ability to do missile defense in theaters throughout the world. \nHe understood the mission intimately \u2014 the warfighters he provided support for as a civilian were the very same units he served in during his time in the military. \n\u201cI was a perfect fit for this job. I was doing really well. My supervisor was telling me I was doing really well, and if it was up to him, he would fight for me. But he was kept out of the conversation. It hurts me, because I worked extremely hard to get this position. I loved this job. The team I was on was the best team I was ever on. My supervisor was amazing, and I got fired for no reason whatsoever,\u201d he said.\nWhile many probationary employees were aware for some time they were on a list of those potentially facing termination, the DMA employee said there was no indication he would be laid off until he was in the HR office being told to sign documents and turn in his ID card. In fact, he was actively preparing to go on a work trip abroad prior to being fired that day. \nHe also never had a formal performance review \u2014 his mid-year evaluation was scheduled for the end of March.\n\u201cHow are you going to let people go based off of performance if these people aren't even being evaluated for performance? They have no indication of what their performance is other than the verbals from their supervisor. That's not quantifiable,\u201d he said. \nThe reason for his firing was to \u201cfurther promote the efficiency of the federal service.\u201d\n\u201cEven if they offer me my job back, I really don't know if I would take it. I don't want to subject myself or my family to that. I don't want to put myself in a position where I could lose my job again,\u201d he said.\nAfter being sworn into office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to deploy a \"next-generation missile defense shield\" to protect the U.S. against aerial attacks. The agency was given 60 days to come with a plan for the Iron Dome for America \u2014 it is now seeking a wide range of advanced capabilities that would require significant investment, new technology, and infrastructure. \n\u201cThey're expecting to increase the funds later this summer because of the Iron Dome for America \u2014 we were expecting that the workload was going to get massive to support this. You're not going to be able to get all that if you just slash the workforce, because you can't fire everybody and then quadruple the work,\u201d the fired DMA employee said.\nIt is unclear how many employees have been let go so far, or when the next round of firings will take place.  The department said it was preparing to reduce its civilian workforce by 5-8%. \n**If you would like to contact this reporter about recent changes in the federal government, please email anastasia.obis@federalnewsnetwork.com or reach out on Signal at (301) 830-2747**\nThe post Veterans, top performers among those fired at DoD in first round of layoffs first appeared on Federal News Network.", "title": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's probationary employee layoffs at DoD face criticism for inconsistent application, impacting veterans and high performers despite claims of performance-based terminations, amid plans for costly missile defense expansions.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "The US Defense Department's initial round of layoffs, affecting 5,400 probationary civilian employees, has raised questions about the fairness of the process.

This guide is primarily for product-based companies, not service-based ones.\n## The reality of DoD contracts\nFirst things first: The best technology doesn't always win the contract. While the DoD wishes that were the case, in practice, it's usually the company that can shape the requirements before anyone else who ultimately wins. However, don't misunderstand \u2014 if you have an inferior product it will be exposed, jeopardizing not only your company but potentially the lives of American soldiers. So ensure your product is genuinely valuable.\n## Essentials for selling to the DoD\nTo successfully sell to the DoD, you need three main things:\n### 1. A superior product\nEven though the best tech doesn\u2019t always win, you must offer a product that is 10x better than the current solution. Here's why it makes all the difference:\n  * **Champion support** : Your DoD champions (end users and program managers) need to back you; they won\u2019t fight for a mediocre product that doesn\u2019t address a real need.\n  * **Clear justification** : Your solution must stand out above the rest. When budgets get tight and your solution gets put on the chopping block it needs to be clear why it\u2019s needed to survive.\n  * **Advocacy ability** : Your champions must be able to explain why your solution is the most important everyone should be worrying about. They'll be advocating on your behalf when you aren\u2019t in the room.\n\n\nEducate your champions \u2014 it\u2019s critical.\n### 2. A contract vehicle\nThe DoD can\u2019t just swipe a credit card to buy your product (though wouldn\u2019t that be nice). Instead, they use contract vehicles \u2014 the mechanisms that allow them to legally purchase goods and services.\nContracting officers (KOs) handle the process. They create contracts, ensure compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and use specific contract vehicles to make purchases happen.\nHere\u2019s how you can secure a contract vehicle:\n  * **GSA Schedule**: This is a list of approved off-the-shelf products. While it\u2019s crowded with other offerings, it\u2019s a great way to get your product into the hands of warfighters.\n  * **Subcontracting** : This can be a great way to get some experience and money under your belt without dealing with all the legal red tape of managing a contract vehicle. You can get a company to prime a contract with an existing vehicle. You will provide some components but they will usually integrate the final solution.\n  * **Resellers** : Similar to a subcontracting partnership except the resellers don\u2019t provide any tech, just the contract vehicle. They will take a percentage of your wins but will manage the vehicle.\n  * **Win your own** : Big awards you hear about, like \"$250 million contracts,\" are often indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. These set a maximum spending limit but don\u2019t guarantee actual funding. You\u2019ll need to hustle to get dollars routed through the IDIQ for your product. You can also win an other transaction authority; read more about them below.\n\n\n## Identifying your DoD customers\nIf you're starting from scratch, the first thing you need to know is who cares about what you're building and how to get in front of them. Tools exist that can help you create a campaign to find all the places in the DoD where there's money allocated for your solution. Keep tabs on these individuals \u2014 they will be your customers and champions. Track what they care about, their position changes, and the events they attend.\n## Understanding how the DoD buys: Program executive offices\n## What Are PEOs?\nProgram executive offices (PEOs) are the entities within the DoD that actually purchase products. However, they do not decide what to buy. This is a critical distinction. Many companies approach a PEO too early with an innovative capability, but PEOs are simply shoppers given a list of requirements \u2014 they facilitate the procurement and award process based on predefined needs.\n## The importance of requirements\nDoD publishes the National Defense Strategy every four years, outlining its priorities. Alongside this, every year DoD assesses needs down to the unit level to determine what's broken, what needs updating, and what new acquisitions are necessary. These assessments become the requirements for the year, which are then passed on to PEOs to manage the procurement and management of these requirements, which become government programs.\n## Building advocacy among end users\nIt's crucial to meet end users at industry days or conferences and demonstrate your capability. When the requirements are being formulated, you want your technology to be top of mind. These end users become your champions \u2014 they need to be vocally advocating for your product, saying, \"We need this thing, or we are royally screwed,\" and be able to explain why.\n## Shaping the Requirements\nIf you're replacing an existing solution, there\u2019s likely already a requirement for your product. That requirement goes to a program manager (PM), who might issue a request for information (RFI) \u2014 a golden opportunity for you.\nIdeally, you\u2019ve already spoken to the PM about their upcoming needs before the RFI comes out. Either way this is called the shaping process**.** During this time, you show the PM why your product is the best solution for their problem and that the requirement should really fit your solution. This is what a killer business development unit does and the primes do it best. However, don\u2019t overpromise; make sure your thing is actually the best or else make it the best.\nIf you shape the requirement well, the RFI \u2014 and the later request for proposal (RFP) \u2014 should align closely with your product. Congrats, you have successfully shaped an RFP. Submit a strong proposal, and you\u2019ll be in a great position to win the contract.\n## Leveraging innovation arms and programs\nFor smaller companies, another pathway is through innovation arms, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants, or other transaction authorities (OTAs).\n### Innovation Arms (main ones)\nUpdating list of all of the innovation arms.\nPDF Map of Innovation Ecosystem. (Download for high quality)\n#### **AFWERX**\n  * **Overview** : The Air Force's innovation arm, deploying significant capital each year \u2014 approximately $1B to $1.5B across Phase I, II, and III \u2014 to small businesses.\n  * **Phase I** : Securing a Phase I grant isn't too difficult. While it may not propel you far, it's a good credential to get you in front of better customers.\n  * **Phase II and III** : These phases are more substantial and worth pursuing if you're at the appropriate stage. More about these in the SBIR section.\n\n\n#### **Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)**\n  * **Background** : Established within the last seven years, DIU's inception stemmed from innovative uses of acquisition policies and rapid contracting.\n  * **Claim to fame** : DIU excels at taking startups to a program of record or securing them significant contracts in six months or less, primarily through the use of OTAs \u2014 more on these in the OTA section.\n\n\n#### **NavalX**\n  * **Role** : Similar to AFWERX but with less volume, NavalX is good for introductions to Navy customers.\n\n\n#### **Army xTech**\n  * **Role** : The Army's equivalent of NavalX, also operating with less volume than AFWERX.\n\n\n#### Strategy with innovation arms\nIt\u2019s important to note that many of these innovation arms expect you to be past the MVP phase and ideally with commercial customers. A pro tip: Innovation arms gather their contract topics by consulting units and branches about their needs. If you can connect with a unit or program manager and demonstrate your capability, they might propose it as a topic to one of the innovation arms, thereby securing you a SBIR topic that is practically written for you.\n### SBIRs and OTAs\n#### What is a SBIR?\nThe SBIR program involves the DoD setting aside significant funds annually to provide non-dilutive funding to small companies working on cutting-edge technologies that could revolutionize warfare. DoD maintains a list of all of its SBIRs.\n##### Phases of SBIR\n  * **Phase I**\n\n\n\u25cb **Award size** : Typically ranges from $50,000 to $250,000. Six-twelve month period of work.\n\u25cb **Purpose** : These grants are essentially free money but may not have a long-term impact. They're useful as credentials that can help your communications get noticed. The output is usually a demo or white paper.\n  * **Phase II**\n\n\n\u25cb **Award size** : Usually around $750,000. Two year period of work.\n\u25cb **Value** : More substantial than Phase I, these grants involve more work but offer the chance to interact with a real DoD unit or customer, allowing for product iteration and building champions.\n  * **Phase III**\n\n\n\u25cb **Award size** : Ranges from a couple hundred thousand to many millions.\n\u25cb **Significance** : These grants are extremely helpful as they provide a contract vehicle, meaning any DoD customer can purchase from you if they have the funds. This opens many business opportunities and helps connect you with key customers to discuss becoming a program of record.\n#### What Is an OTA?\nOTA agreements have gained popularity in recent years due to their innovative use in providing rapid contracting by bypassing the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). Navigating the FAR can be challenging, so OTAs offer a streamlined alternative.\n  * **Usage** : Mainly employed by innovative contracting officers or the DIU.\n  * **Strategy** : If you find someone who supports your product and is knowledgeable about OTAs, hold on to them", "title": "To succeed in selling to the DoD, companies must develop a 10x superior product, secure a contract vehicle, and leverage end-user advocacy while utilizing innovation arms like AFWERX and DIU for non-dilutive funding and streamlined procurement.", "summary": "Selling to the US Department of Defense (DoD) requires understanding crucial aspects beyond just having a superior product. While having the best technology is essential, it's not always the winning factor; shaping requirements before others often secures the contract. To successfully sell to the DoD, focus on three key areas:\n\n* **Superior Product**: Offer a 10x better solution than the current one, ensuring champion support, clear justification, and advocacy ability.\n\n* **Contract Vehicle**: Utilize options like GSA Schedule, subcontracting, resellers, or winning your own indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or other transaction authorities (OTAs).\n\n* **Identifying Customers**: Use tools to find DoD individuals allocated for your solution, tracking their interests, position changes, and event attendance.\n\nAdditionally, understanding how the DoD buys through Program Executive Offices (PEOs), which facilitate procurement based on predefined needs, is vital. Building advocacy among end-users and shaping requirements can significantly enhance your chances. For smaller companies, innovation arms like AFWERX, Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), NavalX, and Army xTech, as well as Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants and OTAs, offer alternative pathways to securing contracts.", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://www.cfo.com/news/generation-west-virginias-cfo-candice-holcomb-federal-funding-cuts-doge-gen-z/742545/", "domains": ["Economic Development", "Workforce Development"], "highlights": ["CFO Candice Holcomb of Generation West Virginia is addressing federal funding cuts by diversifying revenue streams and emphasizing salary transparency to attract Gen Z talent.", "Holcomb's nonprofit focuses on combating West Virginia's brain drain through programs like broadband expansion and career training in data analytics.", "She highlights the importance of mission-critical impact and adapting to Gen Z's demands for workplace respect and clear compensation structures."], "names": ["Candice Holcomb", "Generation West Virginia", "Gen Z", "Adam Zaki"], "text": "The nonprofit CFO details how she\u2019s planning for possible cuts to federal funding, the working demands of Gen Z and factors that make up the state\u2019s economic future.\nPublished March 14, 2025 \nAdam Zaki Reporter\n  * email\n  * license\n\n\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback. \nAs federal funding cuts sweep through Washington, D.C., via DOGE inquiries and executive orders, nonprofit CFOs across the country have been tasked with positioning their organizations in ways that make them as prepared as possible for potential funding cuts while also ensuring they stay mission critical.\nWhile many nonprofits have longstanding histories and donation pipelines that can sustain them in perpetuity, smaller ones face a significant challenge. For , a nonprofit in the Mountain State formed to help combat the state\u2019s brain drain problem, CFO Candice Holcomb is taking this challenge head-on.\nThrough efforts to diversify revenue streams, embrace new ideas to change fundraising tactics and ensure their impact is both seen and felt across the state, Holcomb and her team are focused on helping develop what has been called the \u201c\u201d into an economic landscape where homegrown talent can build and sustain lives for generations to come.\n### Candice Holcomb\n**CFO, Generation West Virginia**\n**First CFO Position:** 2023\n**Notable Previous Employers:**\n  * West Virginia University Institute of Technology\n\n\n_This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity._\n#### **ADAM ZAKI: Are you worried about your funding given the cuts in federal spending being implemented by the current administration?**\n**CANDICE HOLCOMB:** Let\u2019s just say we are definitely not unaffected. A lot of our income comes from federal sources, but I have really focused on making sure that all our eggs aren\u2019t in one basket, so to speak. We\u2019ve been able to forecast these changes and work on developing other revenue streams that can help supplement cuts in funding.\nWe have great relationships with our donors, and our philanthropy efforts have been impactful. However, we would not exist without our federal funding. That money comes with a lot of strings attached on how it can be used, and you\u2019re locked in a bit in terms of scope and purpose. It\u2019s an administrative burden to be proactive with these funds once decisions are made, so looking for ways to earn our own revenue has been a focus for a bulk of my time here.\nOver the past month, we\u2019ve been having a lot of strategic conversations about this. We are watching closely, making sure we remain mission critical and making it known that what we do is making an impact. However, we are all still focused on providing native West Virginians with opportunities to build amazing careers and lives in this state.\n#### Your organization helps employ lots of young people out of college. What would you say are the most important elements right now that leaders have control over that can attract strong Gen Z talent?\n**HOLCOMB:** They want respect for their time and respect for their voice. For example, salary transparency is a big deal right now. We have implemented this in our organization and do not allow any employers to post on our job board without some type of well-defined salary range. Personally, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that people go through three rounds of interviews and then have to negotiate salary without any idea of what the range is. Even in my role here, I knew exactly what the salary was when I took it.\nI think this is a trend that will continue and is one of the many things young people want that maybe some of their older counterparts didn't. Here in West Virginia, and I\u2019m sure elsewhere, young people need to know what type of compensation they will earn before even pursuing the interview process. We push that really hard internally, to our members and to the companies that we feature on our job board.\n#### **Have you gotten pushback from employers when you\u2019ve requested salary transparency from these companies looking to hire?**\n**HOLCOMB:** Sometimes, but it\u2019s never a fight or a major deterrent. They understand, and as a finance person, I understand their side too. I know what my budget is when I hire someone, and plenty of companies would love to save $10,000 or more by lowballing an offer.\nEventually, this will catch up to them. It will cause a great employee to leave. So, I think offering a fair salary that is known to the applicant early on is really important, and this idea is becoming much more popular as more Gen Z applicants enter the workforce.\n#### **Can you give me an example of how finance has had a direct impact on the evolution of fundraising tactics?**\n**HOLCOMB:** This we are having is a great example of this, and we\u2019re hoping it can be our goose that lays golden eggs. We used to do a gala, where we provided drinks and an event in exchange for donations. They were successful, but we wanted to create a space where we could bring in revenue while also providing a benefit to attendees that goes beyond entertainment. We wanted to facilitate meaningful conversations about the challenges we see across our state.\nI\u2019ve seen numbers that say Gen Z will make up 60% of the workforce by 2030, but West Virginia has a brain drain problem that you\u2019ve well documented. We have the highest rates of young adults living in poverty. We have a lot of unique challenges here.\nSo, if we can provide a conference experience that addresses the challenges around the state\u2019s economy while also highlighting the reasons we love it here so much, the value \u2014 on top of the revenue it brings in \u2014 can be impactful. There is a significant workload for the organization, as well as for finance, but being able to provide an opportunity to our supporters that embodies our mission is something really special that I\u2019ve enjoyed being a part of.\n#### **Are there any new industries that have begun to employ large numbers of residents in West Virginia?**\n**HOLCOMB:** has been an area of focus for us. We have a program called NewForce that supports this field. We made a curriculum update to data analytics from software development this year because of recent market research. The market was starved for software developers five years ago, but now that demand has slowly waned. Software development is a very tricky industry to time right when you enter, but it can be a life-changing career with the proper guidance.\nMost people don\u2019t have four years to give up to pursue a new degree, especially those who are reskilling, so being able to learn data analytics in four to five months is an opportunity that can provide residents with new career options.\n#### **Where have some of the organization's allocation efforts lately been most impactful?**\n**HOLCOMB:** We\u2019ve been really focused on continuing the rollout of our broadband program, which aims to get people in the most rural parts of the state connected to the internet. But it\u2019s more than just giving them a connection; it\u2019s about teaching them how to do things like pay bills online, use telehealth, practice cybersecurity and find ways to participate in the digital economy.\nWe\u2019ve been able to execute multiple initiatives, including providing county-level digital equity plans to 18 distressed counties in the state. Each has its own custom digital inclusion plan and a way to communicate about the challenges of the connection process and a way forward.\n#### **I\u2019ve heard areas in the Eastern Panhandle around Harpers Ferry and Charles Town are now being considered as suburbs of Washington, D.C. Is this true?**\n**HOLCOMB:** I think it\u2019s partially legitimate. I know a few West Virginians who chose to live there because they wanted to stay in the state but wanted better access to the Northeast. I know people who commute on the train from Harpers Ferry to D.C. Housing is very expensive around D.C., and that area around Harpers Ferry is so beautiful, so I definitely see the appeal of moving there and making that commute.\n### Recommended Reading\n  * Generation West Virginia CFO Candice Holcomb: Solving \u2018Brain Drain\u2019 in the Mountain State  CFO\n\n\n  *   * purchase licensing rights\n\n\nFiled Under: Human Capital,  People,  Strategy\n### Subscribe to The Balance\nGet the free daily newsletter with financial industry insights and practical advice for CFOs.\n###  Editors' picks \n  * ###  The CFO Earnings Dispatch \nMonthly updates on interesting takes from CFOs on their company's earnings calls. \nBy Adam Zaki \u2022  Updated March 5, 2025 \n  * Tracker\n###  CPA requirements by state \nA resource to help finance leaders track the state-by-state changes to CPA requirements.\nBy Adam Zaki \u2022  Updated March 13, 2025 \n\n\nKeep up with the story.

Please let us know if you have feedback. \nAfter the Office of Internal Audit for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges Board of Regents this week of a $41 million misallocation of state-approved funds at Oklahoma State University, multiple executive changes, including the university\u2019s CFO, have taken place.\n, CFO at the University of Oklahoma for more than 30 years until 2018, . Most recently, he was vice president of fiscal and administrative affairs at Langston University, the state\u2019s only historically Black college or university and, like OSU, operates under the Oklahoma A&M system. His tenure at OSU will begin on March 17.\nDuring Kuwitzky\u2019s tenure at OU, the university faced , an issue that has become across the U.S. His deep experience with higher education finance in Oklahoma likely played a role in his hiring.\nThe audit on OSU found that funds received from July 1, 2022 through Jan. 15, 2025 \u201cwere not properly restricted and in some instances were co-mingled with other funds, leading to expenditures that were not aligned with the restricted purposes.\u201d\nThe misallocation occurred under former university President Kayse Shrum and soon-to-be former interim CFO Eric Polak. The , along with that of former executive director of the university\u2019s Innovation Foundation, Elizabeth Pollard, , as both departures came just weeks before the audit\u2019s findings were published. \nOn Feb. 2, Shrum abruptly resigned after serving for just over three and a half years. She has of any wrongdoing. Shortly after Shrum\u2019s resignation, Pollard also stepped down. Pollard led the Innovation Foundation, formerly the Oklahoma State University Research Foundation, whose funding practices are a contributor to the $41 million misallocation. \n### Audit and failure of financial controls\nThough Polak\u2019s future at the university has not been announced, the audit found that funds were misallocated under his and Shrum\u2019s leadership to the university\u2019s Innovation Foundation in violation of multiple accounting standards and Oklahoma A&M policies. \nAuditors also noted that more than 95% of the foundation\u2019s funding came from money appropriated to the OSU Medical Authority. OSU has since , citing an unsustainable financial structure.\n\u201cThis decision was necessary as the financial structure of The Innovation Foundation is simply not sustainable,\u201d interim President Jim Hess, who has the , wrote in an earlier this week.\nAuditors reported that $11.5 million of the $41 million misallocation was directed to the Innovation Foundation. The funds were unauthorized because there was no written contract between OSU and the A&M board, according to the report, which cites:\n  * **70 O.S. \u00a74306(C):** Prohibits state funds from being transferred to foundations without documented reimbursement agreements.\n  * **Article 10, Section 15 (Oklahoma Constitution):** Forbids public funds from benefiting private entities without proper agreements.\n  * **Board Policy 1.12:** Requires board approval for institutional financial transactions.\n\n\nAuditors also found that more than half of the misallocated funds \u2014 $24 million \u2014 were improperly transferred to unrestricted auxiliary accounts. Education and general funds were used to finance these accounts, which are typically reserved for self-sustaining operations such as dining services, athletics, bookstores and campus parking.\nThe laws and institutional policies violated, according to auditors, include:\n  * **70 O.S. \u00a73901:** Limits state-appropriated education funds to their designated purposes.\n  * **NACUBO Farm 363:** Governs the categorization of government appropriations.\n  * **OSRHE Red Book 4.3.3:** Prohibits education and general funds from subsidizing auxiliary enterprises.\n\n\nAdditionally, auditors found co-mingling of restricted and unrestricted funds totaling more than $20 million, violating financial transparency and spending requirements. The accounting standards and OSU policies violated include:\n  * **OSU Policy 3-0201:** Requires separation of restricted and unrestricted funds.\n  * **GASB 34:** Prohibits improper fund blending in government accounting.\n  * **GASB 46:** Governs financial restrictions for public institutions.\n  * **NACUBO 205.42:** Requires strict classification of funds in higher education.\n\n\nThe audit also found $4 million in a restricted capital account with no intended use, violating OSU policy and GASB regulations, which require restricted funds to be clearly designated and used only for their intended purpose.\nThe relevant policies include:\n  * **OSU Policy 3-0201 (Sections 1.01 & 7.03):** Requires restricted funds to be used only for their legislated purpose.\n  * **GASB 34:** Mandates accurate fund categorization in public accounting.\n  * **GASB 46:** Ensures compliance with financial restrictions.\n  * **NACUBO 205.42:** Governs proper fund usage in higher education.\n\n\n### Recommended Reading\n  * CFO crimes, litigation, financial control failures, ethics violations, and more  CFO\n\n\n  *   * purchase licensing rights\n\n\nFiled Under: People\n### Subscribe to The Balance\nGet the free daily newsletter with financial industry insights and practical advice for CFOs.\n###  Editors' picks \n  * Tracker\n###  CPA requirements by state \nA resource to help finance leaders track the state-by-state changes to CPA requirements.\nBy Adam Zaki \u2022  Updated March 13, 2025 \n  * ###  CFO crimes, litigation, financial control failures, ethics violations, and more \nA collection of stories on CFOs who have failed to adhere to the law or failed ethics class.\nBy CFO Editorial Staff \u2022  Updated 23 hours ago \n\n\nKeep up with the story.

They tend not to use inductive charging at all\nOn one hand this makes sense. If Apple has market research proving that the vast majority of its target market won\u2019t use MagSafe, then removing it may not actually matter much.\nI wonder, though, who that market really is.\nFor example, is Apple mainly targeting former iPhone SE customers with the iPhone 16e? If so, the fact that those users always charge with a cable could be for a very simple reason: they\u2019ve never had the option of MagSafe.\nIt\u2019s one thing if charging with a cable is an intentional preference for iPhone 16e buyers. But if Apple thinks its customers won\u2019t care just because their current habit involves a cable, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a fair judgment.\n## Top comment by Blurft\nLiked by 11 people \nI'm glad this article points out that the behavior of customers may be due to the previous SE not having MagSafe, because that's a very solid explanation for why those user might not have used wireless charging. Apple essentially saying \"They didn't use the bad experience, so we assume they don't want the good experience\" is flawed logic.\nApple should also recognize that people can and do use MagSafe outside of charging situations. I have an iPhone 16 Pro and almost exclusively use wired charging because it's faster and more efficient, but I have a MagSafe mount in a vehicle that doesn't have CarPlay. I also have a MagSafe PopSocket wallet that simply...wouldn't work with this device.\nIt sounds like Apple is grasping for an explanation that _sounds_ plausible at first glance...but quickly falls apart with any kind of critical thought.\nView all comments\nThe previous iPhone SE supported wireless charging, but never MagSafe. So users would have encountered an inferior form of wireless charging, and potentially stuck with wired charging as a result.\nBut maybe Apple knows that even for iPhone 12, 13, and 14 owners who might be upgrading, those users tend not to care about MagSafe. Or the vast that goes beyond charging.\nThe iPhone 16e is almost in users\u2019 hands, so we should find out soon\nWhat do you think about Apple\u2019s MagSafe explanation? Let us know in the comments.\n### Best iPhone accessories\n_FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links._ More.\nYou\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

However, only a naive Mac user would fall for it, as you\u2019d have to first be fooled into clicking on a link and then follow instructions to bypass Gatekeeper.\n> The attack occurs when a user gets an email containing a URL, and when the user opens it, a webpage launches with an alert stating that the browser needs to be updated. When the Update button is clicked, an installer is saved to the Mac, and the user is instructed to open it by Control-clicking on the app icon and selecting Open from the pop-up menu. Opening the file this way bypasses Gatekeeper, macOS\u2019s built-in security that checks for malicious apps. This then installs the malware.\nThe usual safety precautions apply.

The original model launched in 2016, with a four-year wait for the 2nd-gen in 2020. That was followed by the 3rd-gen model two years later.\nHaving a completely separate naming convention for the budget model meant that Apple was free to launch new models as and when it wanted, without the name growing dated.\n## But the iPhone 16e could signal a change\nBut that\u2019s changed with the iPhone 16e.

But what if farmers could trick these invaders into self-destructing? Scientists at UC Riverside think they've found a way.\nAcross sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, places already struggling with food insecurity, entire fields of staples like rice and sorghum can be lost to a group of insidious weeds that drain crops of their nutrients before they can grow. Farmers battle these parasites with few effective tools, but UCR researchers may be able to turn the weeds' own biology against them.\nThis trick is in the journal _Science_ , and at its heart lies a class of hormones called strigolactones\u2014unassuming chemicals that play dual roles. Internally, they help control growth and the plants' response to stresses like insufficient water. Externally, they do something that is unusual for plant hormones.\n\"Most of the time, plant hormones do not radiate externally\u2014they aren't exuded. But these do,\" said UCR plant biologist and paper co-author David Nelson. \"Plants use strigolactones to attract fungi in the soil that have a beneficial relationship with plant roots.\"\nUnfortunately for farmers, parasitic weeds have learned to hijack the strigolactone signals, using them as an invitation to invade.\nOnce the weeds sense the presence of strigolactones, they germinate and latch on to a crop's roots, draining them of essential nutrients.\n\"These weeds are waiting for a signal to wake up. We can give them that signal at the wrong time\u2014when there's no food for them\u2014so they sprout and die,\" Nelson said. \"It's like flipping their own switch against them, essentially encouraging them to commit suicide.\"\nTo understand strigolactone production, the research team led by Yanran Li, formerly at UCR and now at UC San Diego, developed an innovative system using bacteria and yeast. By engineering E. coli and yeast cells to function like tiny chemical factories, they recreated the biological steps necessary to produce these hormones. This breakthrough allows researchers to study strigolactone synthesis in a controlled environment and potentially produce large amounts of these valuable chemicals.\nThe researchers also studied the enzymes responsible for producing strigolactones, identifying a metabolic branch point that may have been crucial in the evolution of these hormones from internal regulators to external signals.\n\"This is a powerful system for investigating plant enzymes,\" Nelson said. \"It enables us to characterize genes that have never been studied before and manipulate them to see how they affect the type of strigolactones being made.\"\nBeyond agriculture, strigolactones hold promise for medical and environmental applications.

While the latest iPad Air is now powered by the M3 chip, iPad 11 (the base model in the lineup) features the A16 chip. And because of this, it lacks support for Apple Intelligence features.\n## No Apple Intelligence for the new iPad 11\nThere was no special event to announce the new iPads. Instead, the company simply put the new products on its online store. In a press release, Apple points out that the A16 chip is 50% faster than the A13 chip in the previous entry-level iPad. And although the company says the iPad 11 has \u201cpowerful and intelligent features,\u201d there\u2019s one big feature missing.\nThe comparison page for all iPad models on Apple\u2019s website confirms that the iPad 11 with the A16 chip has no support for Apple Intelligence features. This means that customers who buy the new iPad won\u2019t benefit from things like Writing Tools, Genmoji, and enhanced Siri.\nThe A16 chip was first introduced in the iPhone 14 Pro lineup and then brought to the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. The chip has only 6GB of RAM, which is less than the minimum 8GB required by Apple Intelligence. Although this isn\u2019t the first time Apple has cut software features (such as Stage Manager) from the entry-level iPad, the decision is somewhat surprising given that the company has been pushing Apple Intelligence a lot recently.\nThe A16 chip that powers the new iPad 11 has a 5-core CPU and 4-core GPU. For comparison, the same chip in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 has an additional CPU and GPU core.\nBack to Apple Intelligence, the feature requires devices with the A17 Pro chip (such as the and ) or later, and M1 or later.\niPad 11 starts at $349 in the US, now with 128GB of storage (double the previous version).

But depending on what model you\u2019re upgrading from, some of those losses might seem significant. Here\u2019s a full iPhone 16e vs iPhone 14 Pro comparison that aims to answer the question: is the 16e an upgrade or downgrade?\n## General specs overview\nI\u2019ll start out by listing out some general iPhone specs to compare the two models, then do a deep dive into two main areas of difference: displays and cameras.\nAs you can see, the iPhone 16e mostly wins this battle\u2014with some exceptions.\nPerhaps most importantly, iPhone 16e has the chip and RAM requirements necessary to support Apple Intelligence features. It\u2019s also lighter weight, has an Action button, gets better battery life, and has a USB-C port.\nThe only real negatives: it\u2019s lacking the MagSafe support and Ultra Wideband chip found in the iPhone 14 Pro.\n## Display\nThis is one area where the winner is clear, with no asterisks or qualifications: it\u2019s iPhone 14 Pro.\niPhone 14 Pro beats or matches the iPhone 16e in every single relevant display category.\nThe trifecta of the Dynamic Island, 120Hz ProMotion, and Always-On could be especially hard to give up for anyone moving from a 14 Pro to the 16e. Screen brightness is in the 14 Pro\u2019s favor too.\n## Cameras\nCameras offer another area where the iPhone 14 Pro largely beats the iPhone 16e.\nBeyond simply offering a more robust three-camera system versus the 16e\u2019s single camera, there are several other features you give up when moving from the 14 Pro. \nThe only real 16e advantages are:\n  * lower aperture on the main camera, which should help produce better low-light photos\n  * and the new Audio Mix and wind noise reduction features for video\n\n\n## iPhone 16e vs 14 Pro: Mixed bag\nIf you\u2019re an iPhone 14 Pro user considering buying the iPhone 16e, my recommendation is to buy a different model instead. You can get an for close to the same price as a new 16e. That would enable Apple Intelligence support without giving up so many of the advantages of your current Pro model.\nIt all comes down to what you care about most. If the iPhone 16e has the features you care about, it\u2019s a solid option. But if you can afford to jump up into an iPhone 16, 16 Pro, or a refurbished 15 Pro instead, that might be a better move.\nDo you plan to upgrade from an iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone 16e?

Compared to the iPhone 14 Pro, the 16e has some significant losses.

While it features a slew of much-needed upgrades over the iPhone SE 3, there is a catch: a higher price tag.\nOn the surface, it's easy to be disappointed about a price bump, however, the iPhone 16e punches above its weight class with a slate of features that make the flagship iPhone 16 look _over_ -priced in comparison.\n## The iPhone SE is gone, along with its budget-friendly price\n(Image credit: Apple, edited with Adobe Express)\nOn Wednesday, after weeks of rumors about an impending product launch, Apple finally unveiled the iPhone 16e. It's the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, now with a modern design, all-new specs, and an array of features that make the iPhone SE 3 look like a relic.\nThe \"iPhone SE\" name isn't the only thing Apple retired, either. It also abandoned the SE's sub-$500 price tag. The iPhone SE 3, released in 2022, started at $429. That's at the upper end of the budget price bracket, but still much more affordable than the flagship iPhones.\nThe same cannot be said for the iPhone 16e, which starts at $599, about $200 less than the flagship iPhone 16, but over $100 more than the old iPhone SE. That's a price bump that budget users will feel most, perhaps even enough to dissuade them from upgrading or push new iPhone users to opt for an older, used iPhone instead. It also puts the iPhone 16e solidly in the mid-range price bracket.\n## Is the iPhone 16e the best value iPhone you can buy?\nI'll admit, I was disappointed when I saw the iPhone 16e's price. A price increase was likely, but few were expecting it to come just shy of $600. However, I changed my mind about the iPhone 16e when I took a closer look at, specifically at how its specs compare to those of the flagship iPhone 16:\nThe iPhone 16 and iPhone 16e are shockingly similar on paper. There are some trade-offs to the less expensive iPhone 16e, of course. It lacks the Camera Control button, isn't MagSafe compatible, has a different camera setup, and has one less GPU core. However, those drawbacks are also balanced out by better battery life and a price that starts $200 lower than the iPhone 16.\nThe iPhone 16e has everything most users care about, including a modern Apple processor, support for Apple Intelligence, USB Type-C charging, and likely great battery life. The new 2-in-1 camera system seems promising, as well, at least for the casual photos most everyday users need their phone for.\nYes, the higher price puts the iPhone 16e out of reach for some who may have liked the iPhone SE. However, I'd argue the iPhone 16e hits a different note that is perhaps even more valuable than an overture to the budget market.\nThe iPhone 16e may be the best iPhone for most people now.\nThe mid-range price is hard to argue with and the trade-offs compared to the pricier iPhone 16 are minor compromises for most users, especially when you get better battery life in the exchange. Considering how similar the iPhone 16e is to its flagship counterpart, it's difficult to justify paying more for just a few upgrades.\nI've been holding out on upgrading my old iPhone 12 Mini, reluctant to shell out hundreds for a new iPhone that offers little my current phone doesn't already have. The iPhone 16e might finally get me to trade in my trusty Mini, though, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n## More from Laptop Mag\n  * Apple's iPhone 16e brings better performance, battery, and camera to the SE line \u2014 and a big price bump\n  * Tired of waiting for Apple's big Siri upgrade?

It supports multiple gateways with ECMP routing, allows overriding default routes without disrupting cluster connectivity, and enables node-specific routing via label selectors."], "names": ["DigitalOcean", "DOKS", "ECMP", "Kubernetes"], "text": "# Introducing a Managed Component for Maintaining Host Routes in Kubernetes\n\nOur new **DOKS routing agent** is a managed component for configuring static routes on Kubernetes worker nodes. It is a direct response to user feedback on its predecessor, the static route operator, and introduces new features to enhance routing flexibility. Despite being a managed component, the DOKS routing agent is included **at no additional cost** for users.\n## Key Features of the DOKS Routing Agent\n### 1. Static Route Management via Custom Resources\nThe DOKS routing agent enables users to configure IP routes on their Kubernetes worker nodes using a dedicated Kubernetes Custom Resource. This is particularly useful for VPN setups or tunneling egress traffic through specific gateway nodes.\n#### Example Configuration:\n`apiVersion: networking.doks.digitalocean.com/v1alpha1 kind: Route metadata:   name: basic spec:   destinations:     - \"1.2.3.4/5\" # Networks to be routed via the specified gateways   gateways:     - \"10.114.0.3\" # Gateway IP`\n### 2. Support for Multiple Gateways and ECMP\nThe routing agent supports multiple gateways and automatically configures ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) routing to distribute traffic across them.\n#### Example Configuration:\n`apiVersion: networking.doks.digitalocean.com/v1alpha1 kind: Route metadata:   name: basic spec:   destinations:     - \"1.2.3.4/5\"   gateways:     - \"10.114.0.3\"     - \"10.114.0.4\"`\n**How ECMP Works:**\n  * ECMP distributes traffic across multiple gateways based on a hash of source/destination IP and port.\n  * If a gateway fails, the Linux kernel stops sending traffic to it.\n  * The routing agent pings gateways every 30 seconds to detect failures and restore traffic flow when a gateway recovers.\n  * **Note:** Ensure that ICMP traffic is allowed on gateways for health checks to function properly.\n\n\n### 3. Overriding Default Routes\nThe routing agent allows users to override default routes without disrupting cluster connectivity\u2014one of the most requested features.\n#### Example Configuration:\n`apiVersion: networking.doks.digitalocean.com/v1alpha1 kind: Route metadata:   name: basic spec:   destinations:     - \"0.0.0.0/0\" # Default route   gateways:     - \"10.114.0.3\"     - \"10.114.0.4\"`\nTo prevent issues with Kubernetes components, the routing agent ensures that essential control plane endpoints, metadata services, and DNS servers maintain direct connectivity through the worker node Droplet\u2019s default gateway.\n### 4. Node Selection for Routes\nRoutes can be applied to specific nodes using Kubernetes label selectors, allowing for fine-grained control over network configurations.\n#### Example Configuration:\n`apiVersion: networking.doks.digitalocean.com/v1alpha1 kind: Route metadata:   name: basic spec:   destinations:     - \"1.2.3.4/5\"   gateways:     - \"10.114.0.3\"   nodeSelector:     nodeSelectorTerms:     - matchExpressions:       - key: doks.digitalocean.com/node-pool         operator: In         values: [\"worker-pool\"]`\n## Enabling the DOKS Routing Agent\nThe routing agent can be enabled or disabled using **doctl** or the **DigitalOcean API**.\n### Example Commands:\n```\n\n  1. doctl kubernetes cluster create --enable-routing-agent ...\n\n  2. \n\n  3. doctl kubernetes cluster update --enable-routing-agent ...\n\n\n\n\n```\n\nFor API users, the field structure is:\n```\n\n  1. {\n\n  2. \n\n  3.   \"routing_agent\": { \"enabled\": true }\n\n  4. \n\n  5. }\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n## Usage for Static Egress IP\nWith the DOKS routing agent and a self-managed VPC gateway Droplet, users can configure static egress IPs, ensuring outbound traffic from Kubernetes workloads originates from a predictable IP address.\n### Why This Matters:\n  * **Allow-listing:** Secure external services by allow-listing known IPs.\n  * **Compliance:** Maintain a consistent outbound IP for regulatory requirements.\n\n\n### Coming Soon: Fully Managed NAT Gateway\nWe\u2019re also working on a **fully managed NAT gateway** , which will offer a simpler solution for achieving static egress IPs. This feature is on our roadmap and will be available later this year.\n## Simplify Static Route Management\n**The DOKS routing agent streamlines static route management in Kubernetes, providing:**\n  * Custom routes using Kubernetes Custom Resources\n  * Load distribution across multiple gateways with ECMP\n  * Default route overrides without disrupting cluster connectivity\n  * Node-specific routing with label selectors\n\n\nThese features are especially useful for VPN setups, custom egress routing, and self-managed VPC gateways.\n## Get started today\n  * Explore our product documentation\n  * Check out our Managed Kubernetes homepage\n  * Log into your DigitalOcean account**", "title": "DigitalOcean's DOKS routing agent provides managed static route configuration for Kubernetes clusters, supporting ECMP, gateway failover, and node-specific routing through Custom Resources.", "summary": "Introducing the DOKS Routing Agent for Kubernetes\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe DOKS routing agent is a managed component for configuring static routes on Kubernetes worker nodes, available at no additional cost.

(BKNG) the Best Performing Large Cap Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nWe recently published a list of **10 Best Performing Large Cap Stocks to Buy According to Analysts**. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stands against other best performing large cap stocks to buy according to analysts.\n## **Q4 2024 Market Performance Overview**\nOn January 6, Pathstone released its quarterly Flash Report for Q4 2024. The report highlighted several key trends and challenges for the financial markets. It highlighted that despite some volatility towards the end of the quarter in December, the US equity market continued to outperform the international markets, particularly led by the large-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks gained 7.1% during the fourth quarter, driven by strong economic fundamentals, including robust labor market data and high consumer spending during the holiday season. On the other hand, the continued strength of the USD and the persistent inflation led to a decline in other developed markets internationally.\nIn comparison to the large-cap stocks, small-caps faced significant challenges, experiencing a sharp monthly decline of 8.3% in December, though the sector managed a slight quarterly gain of 0.3%. As per the report, this underperformance was partly due to policy uncertainty and rising long-term yields, which dampened expectations for smaller companies. The fixed-income market also struggled, with long-term Treasury bonds declining by 9.7% for the quarter as the 10-year Treasury yield increased to 4.6%. Moreover, while elaborating on the labor market quarterly performance, the report highlighted that the US labor market demonstrated resilience in November, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 jobs, surpassing expectations of 200,000. This growth marked a significant recovery from October\u2019s numbers, which were affected by hurricanes and strikes. Although the unemployment rate increased to 4.2%, the labor market showed fundamental strength despite higher interest rates.\nOne of the key market trends that have helped large-cap growth stocks is the strength of the American consumer market. Consumer spending was exceptionally strong during the holiday season, breaking previous records across both traditional retail and online channels. However, regardless Inflation remains a significant concern as the Consumer Price Index reached 2.7% in November, above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Persistent inflationary pressures are influencing the Fed\u2019s monetary policy approach, leading to a more cautious stance on future rate cuts. Lastly, the report highlights that the economic landscape ahead presents a complex mix of resilience and risk. While the labor market and spending provide a solid foundation to the market persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and policy uncertainty pose potential challenges.\n### **Our Methodology**\nTo curate the list of 10 best-performing large-cap stocks to buy according to analysts, we used the Finviz stock screener to get an aggregated list of stocks. Using the screener we aggregated a list of large-cap stocks that have performed positively over the past year and analysts still see upside potential over the next 12 months. Next, we cross-checked the performance and analyst upside potential of each stock from CNN and ranked these stocks in ascending order of analysts\u2019 upside potential. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock, sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database. Please note that the data was collected on February 28th, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (**see more details here**).\nA fast-paced travel agent making a bookings for a family vacation package. \n### **Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)**\n**_1-Year Performance: 44.02%_**\n_**Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99**_\n**_Analyst Upside Potential: 15.13%_**\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) helps people plan and book their trips and dining experiences online. It operates through several well-known brands including Bookings.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com, KAYAK, and OpenTable. On February 24, DA Davidson raised the price target on the stock from $5,005 to $5,800 and kept a Buy rating. The firm noted that the fiscal fourth quarter results presented a substantial upside in comparison to the market consensus. Moreover, the firm also liked the 13% room night growth, which was driven by growth across all regions.\nIn addition, Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund in their Q4 2024 investor letter mentioned that Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was one of their largest contributors to returns. The fund also noted that it is a leading platform larger than two of its leading competitors combined in terms of room nights booked. Moreover, the operations trends also continue to benefit from the tailwinds coming from increased global travel. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the company grew its gross bookings by 17% and revenue by 14%, both metrics came in above the high end of management\u2019s guidance. It is one of the best-performing large-cap stocks to buy according to analysts.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n> \u201cThe largest contributors to returns were **Booking Holdings Inc.** (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Liberty Formula One (FWONK). BKNG is the leading global travel platform (larger than Airbnb and Expedia combined on an annual room nights booked basis). Operating trends continue to be strong driven by tailwinds from global travel demand and new CFO Ewout Steenbergen finding cost efficiencies following a period of investment. This resulted in third quarter revenue growth of 9% driving Earnings Per Share growth of 16%, a run rate we believe is now sustainable for the business. BKNG has been a highly successful investment, delivering returns of 130% since our first investment in December 2022. But going forward we see less value latency and have consequently begun to redeploy capital into more compelling opportunities.\u201d\nOverall, BKNG ****ranks 8th**** on our list of best performing large cap stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of BKNG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

However, it quickly comes to focus on the story of Jude, gradually revealing his deeply traumatic childhood and the ways it is affecting his adult life.\nIn 2022, UK publisher Picador re-released the novel as part of its new Picador Collection \u2013 a range of \u201cera-defining modern classics\u201d. But how has a novel with such harrowing content become one of the most popular books of the last decade?\n* * *\n_Looking for something good? Cut through the noise with a carefully curated selection of the latest releases, live events and exhibitions, straight to your inbox every fortnight, on Fridays.Sign up here._\n* * *\nThis is one of the clearest examples of the \u201ctrauma plot\u201d, which literary critic Parul Sehgal has identified as a defining feature of our contemporary cultural landscape. The trauma plot refers to stories fixated on the traumatic events experienced by their characters, perhaps neglecting other aspects of characterisation or plotting in favour of detailed explorations of trauma. \nAmerican essayist Daniel Mendelsohn\u2019s early critique in the New York Review of Books countered the novel\u2019s extensive praise elsewhere. He claimed the relentless trauma and abuse suffered by Jude turns it into \u201ca machine designed to produce negative emotions for the reader to wallow in\u201d. \nThis matches Sehgal\u2019s criticism of the way the trauma plot flattens characters and narratives into explorations of the backstory, \u201cevacuating personality\u201d and reducing \u201ccharacter to symptom\u201d. Sehgal asks: \u201cIn a world infatuated with victimhood, has trauma emerged as a passport to status \u2013 our red badge of courage?\u201d \nThis question could well be aimed at A Little Life. The trauma plot, and its exploration of the depths of victimhood and suffering, has been the novel\u2019s passport to notoriety.\n## The power of fomo\nIt\u2019s not only critics that take issue with the novel\u2019s depiction of trauma. Readers have also commented on the seemingly gratuitous nature of the novel\u2019s content and the extreme emotions and reactions it produces. Search \u201cA Little Life\u201d on any social media platform and you will find countless reader reviews ranging from delight to disgust. \nMuch of this discourse is rooted in the novel\u2019s notoriety and graphic content, or how much readers cried when reading it. It exists in the cultural consciousness more as an experience than a literary work \u2013 a challenge to undertake rather than a story to read. \nThe West End theatre adaptation, which ran in 2023, added to this. Reviews and audience anecdotes foregrounded the graphic content and fainting audience members, rather than the performances or story. \nAs a result, there is a culture of fomo (fear of missing out) around the novel, as readers fear they haven\u2019t taken part in one of the big literary experiences of the last decade. This has seen its popularity become self-propagating: more readers, more extreme reactions, more exposure, more fomo.\nThe novel\u2019s consistent readership has been in large part due to online reading communities like BookTok, Bookstagram and BookTube. \n* * *\n_**Read more:How BookTok trends are influencing what you read \u2013 whether you use TikTok or not ** _\n* * *\nThe content they produce is often highly emotional, with creators blending reviews with outpourings of feelings and presenting polarised opinions. Social media platforms and their algorithms reward such extremes by encouraging interaction with and sharing of posts, pushing them \u2013 and therefore the novel \u2013 out to wider audiences. \nThe novel also has its own social media presence. The Instagram account @alittlelifebook has 65.2k followers at the time of writing and still makes multiple posts a week, ten years after the novel\u2019s release. The account frequently reposts fans\u2019 novel-related artwork, photography, playlists and tattoos. This has established a norm of how people interact with the novel \u2013 in highly personal ways that foreground emotion and intimacy with the story. \nThis enables a connection and community among readers through their reaction to the depiction of extreme suffering. Just as the play was a sell-out success despite its mixed reviews, there is this desire for the connecting and cathartic experience of reading and enduring suffering.\n## Queer canon or queer controversy?\nA Little Life has become one of the one of the most widely read and loved queer novels of the last decade. That\u2019s despite considerable controversy over the depiction of its gay characters and Yanagihara\u2019s position as a woman writing about gay male trauma. \nThis controversy has not stopped the actor Matt Bomer, who is gay, from narrating a 10th-anniversary audio book. The actor has also voiced audiobook versions of Giovanni\u2019s Room by James Baldwin (1956) and Little and Often by Trent Preszler (2021) \u2013 both of which explore the alienation of queer people. \nThe West End theatre production starred James Norton as Jude.\nA Little Life is continually placed within a queer canon, as academics and journalists frequently discuss and praise its representation. Readers often place it on lists of the best LGBTQ+ fiction despite its controversial handling of this material \u2013 again suggesting the controversy is fuelling readers\u2019 curiosity rather than quelling it.\nIn a 2020 study of the novel\u2019s reception on social media platform Goodreads, researcher Joseph Worthen suggested it is somewhat unique in producing a \u201creluctant five-star phenomenon\u201d \u2013 where readers do not want to rate the book so highly but feel compelled to, because of the strong emotional impact it had on them. \nThe way emotions trump aesthetics and enjoyment in readers\u2019 judgment of the novel, acting as \u201ca passport to status\u201d, demonstrates why A Little Life remains so popular. It offers a seemingly endless supply of emotion, and possibilities for connection, at a cultural moment when virality rules.\n_Natalie Wall does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment._", "title": "A Little Life's enduring popularity stems from its controversial trauma narrative, viral social media engagement, and queer cultural resonance despite criticism of its emotional manipulation and character depth.", "summary": "Hanya Yanagihara's novel A Little Life, released ten years ago, has become a contemporary classic despite its harrowing content.

However, Apple has more products in the pipeline for the first quarter of the year. One of the most awaited Apple products is the M4 MacBook Air, which has been making the headlines for quite some time now.\nAs reported by Mark Gurman in , Apple is gearing up to unveil the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with M4 chips as soon as March. The company is reportedly preparing its marketing, sales, and retail teams for the product release.\nAdditionally, the inventory of older MacBook Air models is running low in the Apple Store, a subtle sign of Apple preparing to release a new product model.\n> \"I'm told the company is now gearing up for a release in March and has started preparing its marketing, sales and retail teams for the debut.

For comparison, the MacBook Air with M3 chips could score 41,045 in the same test.\nBut here comes the surprising part: the M4 MacBook Air's performance in Geekbench Metal is a mere 5 percent lower than the MacBook Pro M4, which boasts a Metal score of 57,603. Considering the price disparity between the two models, the M4-powered MacBook Air has done an impressive job on the GPU side.\n#### Tags\n  * Apple\n  * Macbook air\n  * Macbook\n  * M4\n  * M4 macbook air\n\n\nLike\nPost\nShare\nReport a problem with article\nNext Article\n###  Telegram faces fine for holding up Australia's child safety questions \nPrevious Article\n###  Microsoft Weekly: super-fast file managers for Windows 11, faster Edge, new builds, and more \n### Subscribe to our Newsletter\n###  Community Activity\nRefresh\n  * Windows 10/11 not respecting DNS server settings in Smart Home, Network & Security\n  * Recommendations for a $650 max laptop? in Hardware Hangout\n  * What are you listening to? in Wall of Sound\n  * Acronyms.... in Jokes & Funny Stuff\n  * What are you playing? in Gamers' Hangout\n  * Basic setup for a novice in Home Theatre Discussion\n  * New look for OneDrive on iOS in Back Page News\n  * It's Happened.

Visual Intelligence, Apple's equivalent to Google Lens, is coming to the 2023 Pro-series flagships, _Daring Fireball_.\nOwners of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro can trigger Visual Intelligence with a long press of their dedicated camera button. But like the recently announced iPhone 16e (which also supports the feature), the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max don't have a physical camera button. So, all three phones will have to assign it to the Action button or use a Control Center shortcut, which will arrive in an upcoming software update.\nApple hasn't said which iOS version will bring the Apple Intelligence visual search feature to the iPhone 15 Pro series. However, _Daring Fireball_ 's John Gruber suspects it will be in iOS 18.4, which could arrive \"any day now\" for beta testers.\nPart of the Apple Intelligence suite of AI features, Visual Intelligence lets you point your camera at something and use AI to analyze it in real time. It does a few things on its own, but it gets more useful with info from its persistent onscreen shortcuts to ChatGPT or Google Image Search.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nSo, say you find a set of towels in your closet with a unique pattern. You really like those dang towels and want to buy more, but you can't remember where you got them. Activate Visual Intelligence, choose the Google search shortcut and see if your beloved rags are among the web results that pop up. Alternatively, you could use ChatGPT to ask it about the product and where to order it.\nVisual Intelligence can also do a few things without the help of Google or OpenAI. You can interact with text: translate, read aloud and summarize. Or learn about a business you point your phone toward: view its hours, menu and services or buy something from it.\nSo, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max owners should get a taste of that before long. And perhaps even sooner for those willing to brave the (sometimes rough) waters of beta software.\n## \nLatest Stories\n  * Engadget\n#### Here's how to pre-order the new Apple iPhone 16e\nThe company's most affordable iPhone starts at $599.\n  * Engadget\n#### ChatGPT's AI agent Operator is now available for most Pro users\nChatGPT Pro users can now access Operator in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the UK.\n  * Engadget\n#### Engadget Podcast: Hello $599 iPhone 16e, RIP iPhone SE\nWell we didn't get the iPhone SE fourth-gen this week \u2014 instead Apple debuted the iPhone 16e, a $599 model based on the iPhone 14's design.\n  * Engadget\n#### The Morning After: Apple reveals its new cheapest iPhone.

Here\u2019s an explanation of what you\u2019re hearing.\nAside from the blues, is the United States\u2019 most significant musical innovation. People typically associate its rubbery, sensual feel with jazz, but swing is everywhere in the musics descended from the African diaspora: ragtime, blues, musical theater, country, R&B, rock, funk, reggae, hip-hop, electronic dance music, and so on. The best way to learn about swing is through aural and hands-on experience. The Groove Pizza is a good way to get started.\n## The basic definition\nYou create swing by alternately stretching and squeezing the two halves of each beat. Say you\u2019re in 4/4 time, and you\u2019re counting subdivided beats like so: _one and two and three and four and._ To swing, you stretch the onbeats (the _ones, twos, threes_ and _fours_), and you shorten the offbeats (the _ands._) The more you alternately stretch and squeeze the subdivisions, the more heavily you swing.\nHere\u2019s a geometric visualization: to swing, you expand the onbeats (the green areas) in the clockwise direction, and shrink the offbeats (the white areas) to fit.\nThis Groove Pizza beat shows the effect of gradually increasing swing. It begins by playing straight eighth notes. Each time it goes through the pattern, the onbeats get a little longer and the offbeats get a little shorter.\nIt might seem wrong to think of a sensual and ineffable quality like swing in such drily mathematical terms. There is certainly more to swing than just the timing of note onsets or drum hits. Swing also depends on how long the notes or hits are, how loud they are, and their articulation. It\u2019s interesting, though, that simply changing the timing of every alternate note onset by tiny amounts has such a profound effect on the feel of the music. People are exquisitely sensitive to rhythmic nuance, even if they aren\u2019t necessarily conscious of it. Swing is a way to infuse strict metronomic time with human warmth and urgency. It takes deep focus to swing, but it also requires relaxation. This zen-like state is difficult to attain, but once you learn to do it, you will never want to stop.\n## Listening examples\nHere\u2019s Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cDance of the Sugarplum Fairy\u201d played without swing:\nAnd here it is with swing:\nHere\u2019s JS Bach\u2019s Concerto for two violins in D minor, without swing:\nAnd here it is with swing:\nFor an even more direct comparison, here\u2019s a two-bar drum machine pattern I made, playing alternately without swing, then with swing. Pay particular attention to the hi-hats (the innermost circle):\n## Swing is not tied triplets\nYou may have seen swing defined as a tied triplet feel, in which the first subdivision of each beat is twice as long as the second one:\nThis is not what swing is! Or, more accurately, this two-to-one subdivision ratio is a specific kind of swing called a _shuffle_ , also known as 12/8 feel. Here\u2019s a song using 12/8 shuffle, \u201cTruckin'\u201d by the Grateful Dead.\nThis may technically be a form of swing, but it is not what jazz musicians are talking about. The two-to-one ratio is only one among infinitely many possible ratios between the lengths of the first and second subdivisions in each beat. The subdivisions might be more equal in length (lighter swing), or more unequal in length (heavier swing). The specific ratio you use depends on the style and tempo of the music. For example, you typically use lighter swing at faster tempos and heavier swing at slower tempos. Jazz players used heavier swing in the 1930s and 40s than they did in the 50s and 60s. The variations are endless.\nTo make things more complicated, swing ratios are not static. You don\u2019t necessarily stick to one ratio throughout a tune. You might use heavier swing at the beginning of a phrase and lighter swing at the end of it. Drummers will also sometimes use different swing ratios simultaneously. For example, on Herbie Hancock\u2019s \u201c,\u201d Harvey Mason uses heavier swing on the kick and snare drum, and lighter swing on the hi-hat.\n## Eighth note swing vs sixteenth note swing\nOne major point of confusion around swing is what beat level you are supposed to be swinging at. If you go on any music forum where they\u2019re talking about swing, you\u2019ll see jazz-trained musicians saying that you\u2019re supposed to swing your eighth notes, while beatmakers say that all their software and hardware is swinging the sixteenth notes. They\u2019re both right, but in different contexts. This is because Black American music underwent a significant shift in about 1960: _the basic pulse unit changed from eighth notes to sixteenth notes._ Jazz and other styles of American vernacular music from before 1960 swing at the _eighth note level._ However, funk and other American vernacular music styles from after 1960 swing at the _sixteenth note level._ If you want to sound jazzy or old-timey, you should use eighth note swing. If you want to sound funky or more contemporary, however, you should use sixteenth note swing.\nStevie Wonder\u2019s classic \u201cSuperstition\u201d begins with four bars of his drumming, which uses heavy sixteenth note swing.\nI\u2019ve visualized the first measure below in Ableton Live.\nThe grid lines are sixteenth notes. You can see how the hi-hats on the sixteenth-note offbeats are consistently late. (Stevie is also a little late on his quarter notes, which contributes to the overall laid-back groove.)\nTo help you hear the difference between eighth note and sixteenth note swing, compare two recordings by the Jackson 5. First, here\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 Robin,\u201d which uses eighth note swing to evoke the 1950s:\nNext, here\u2019s \u201cI Want You Back\u201d, which uses sixteenth note swing for its funk groove, and sounds much closer to the present:\nRay Charles\u2019 arrangement of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d is the rare piece of music that includes both eighth and sixteenth note swing. Most of the tune uses funk-style sixteenth note swing, but during the horn break at , Ray switches to jazz-style eighth note swing.\nThe eighth vs sixteenth note issue is especially confusing for rock musicians, because rock straddles both the eighth note and the sixteenth note eras. When you hear 1950s rock, like Chuck Berry or Buddy Holly, you\u2019re hearing eighth note swing. When you hear rock from the late 1960s and afterwards, you\u2019re hearing sixteenth note swing\u2026 unless the band is deliberately going for an old-timey, bluesy or jazzy vibe. The Grateful Dead, for example, did a lot of jumping back and forth across eras. \u201cSugaree\u201d and \u201cTruckin'\u201d use eighth note swing, while \u201cFranklin\u2019s Tower\u201d and \u201cThe Music Never Stopped\u201d use sixteenth note swing.\nWhen we created the , we weren\u2019t sure how we should label the slices. We ultimately decided not to specify what beat value each slice represents. You can think of the slices as being eighth notes or sixteenth notes, or quarter notes or thirty-second notes for that matter. When you apply the swing parameter, you can think of it as operating at any beat level you want.\n## Tuplet swing\nIf you subdivide your beats by odd ratios, like five or seven, it is possible to produce some intriguing swing ratios. Shawn Crowder of Sungazer enjoys using quintuplet swing, where the onbeat is three fifths of a beat long, and the offbeat is two fifths of a beat long. This creates a feeling that is almost triplets, but not. Your ear can tell that there is a specific relationship between the onbeat and offbeat, but it can\u2019t quite tell what it is. That gives quintuplet swing a \u201cdrunken\u201d feel.\nYou can also get a cool drunken feel with septuplet swing, where the onbeats are four sevenths of a beat long, and the offbeats are three sevenths of a beat long. I can only produce this kind of groove in Ableton; I can\u2019t dial it in on an instrument yet.\n## An analogy: Walking\nGet up and walk around (or watch someone else walking.) Focus on your hips. Is your pelvis moving along in a straight line, or is it swinging left and right with each step? If you are marching, or otherwise holding yourself rigidly upright, your pelvis won\u2019t swing very much. However, if you saunter, sashay, strut, or swagger, your pelvis will swing from side to side like a pendulum. The wider your hips are swinging, the sexier your walk is. (Fun fact: in , the side of your pelvis doing the movement during a given step is called the _swing side._) The analogy to music could not be more perfect: straight rhythm feels like marching, while swung rhythm feels like sauntering, sashaying, strutting, or swaggering.\n## Swing, groove, and syncopation\nWhen people speak casually about jazz, they sometimes use the words _swing, groove,_ and _syncopation_ interchangeably. Jazz does use all three of these things, but they are separate rhythmic concepts. Sync", "title": "Swing rhythm involves alternately lengthening and shortening beat subdivisions, demonstrated through tools like Groove Pizza, with its application evolving from pre-1960 eighth-note jazz to post-1960 sixteenth-note funk styles.", "summary": "Swing in music is the United States' most significant innovation after the blues, characterized by a rubbery, sensual feel. It's created by alternately stretching and squeezing the two halves of each beat, typically by lengthening onbeats and shortening offbeats in a rhythmic pattern. This can be visualized geometrically, with the effect of increasing swing demonstrated through gradual adjustments to note onsets.\n\n- **Key aspects of swing:**\n\n  - Not just about timing, but also note duration, loudness, and articulation\n\n  - Depends on style and tempo, with lighter swing often used at faster tempos and heavier swing at slower tempos\n\n  - Ratios can vary infinitely, with some styles using a more equal subdivision (lighter swing) and others using a more unequal subdivision (heavier swing)\n\n- **Eighth note vs sixteenth note swing:**\n\n  - Pre-1960 Black American music (e.g., jazz) typically swings at the eighth note level\n\n  - Post-1960 music (e.g., funk) often swings at the sixteenth note level\n\n  - Examples: Stevie Wonder's _Superstition_ (sixteenth note swing), Jackson 5's _Rockin' Robin_ (eighth note swing) and _I Want You Back_ (sixteenth note swing)", "collected": 1744084101}, {"_id": "https://www.nrk.no/norge/store_-ukraina-stotten-okes-til-85-milliarder-kroner-1.17327303", "domains": ["Politikk", "Oekonomi"], "highlights": ["Partiene p\u00e5 Stortinget er enige om \u00e5 \u00f8ke st\u00f8tten til Ukraina med 50 milliarder kroner til 85 milliarder i 2025.", "Finansminister Jens Stoltenberg understreker at bel\u00f8pet er innenfor handlingsregelen, som begrenser oljepengebruken til tre prosent av fondets forventede avkastning.", "Oppositionen, inkludert FrP og Sp, krever \u00f8kt st\u00f8tte til norsk forsvar og kritiserer regjeringens bruk av midler p\u00e5 havvind, klima og byr\u00e5krati, med Sp som f\u00f8rer krav om utsettelse av nye havvindprosjekter for \u00e5 spare over 40 milliarder kroner."], "names": ["Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re", "Jens Stoltenberg", "Sylvi Listhaug", "Marit Arnstad"], "text": "Partiene p\u00e5 Stortinget er enige om \u00e5 \u00f8ke st\u00f8tten til Ukraina med 50 milliarder kroner til 85 milliarder i 2025.\nIngvild Edvardsen  \u2013 Journalist Journalist\n+ 6 til\nEinar Torkelsen  \u2013 Journalist Journalist\nPer-Ivar Kvalsvik  \u2013 Journalist Journalist\nKristian Sk\u00e5rdalsmo  \u2013 Journalist Journalist\nVilde Haugen  \u2013 Journalist Journalist\nLill Kristin Har\u00f8y Fenstad  \u2013 Journalist Journalist\nChristian Ziegler Remme  \u2013 Fotograf Fotograf\nPublisert 06.03.2025, kl. 09.02  Oppdatert 06.03.2025, kl. 20.06 \n\u2013 Vi \u00f8ker st\u00f8tten fordi det er behov for det, og det er et solid bidrag til fred og stabilitet i Europa, sa statsminister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re (Ap) etter m\u00f8tet.\nHittil er det satt av 35 milliarder kroner i st\u00f8tte gjennom 2025.

On Wednesday, two men were charged with killing them, prosecutors said. \nClayton McGeeney, 36, Ricky Johnson, 38, and David Harrington, 37, were discovered dead outside the home of Jordan Willis in the Platte County portion of Kansas City around 10 p.m. on January 9, 2024, two days after the men watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Los Angeles Chargers. \nWillis and Ivory J. Carson are both charged with a single count of delivery of a controlled substance and three counts of involuntary manslaughter for \u201crecklessly causing the deaths\u201d of the three men, Platte County Prosecuting Attorney Eric Zahnd said at a Wednesday news conference. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. \nAll three men died of fentanyl and cocaine combined toxicity, a doctor with Forensic Medical of Kansas determined, according to Zahnd. \n\u201cThis case has received considerable attention from the media, and I think some people seem to believe that charges may never be brought in this case,\u201d Zahnd said. \u201cPeople may have doubted this investigation because it has spanned over a year.\u201d \nDetectives obtained consent to search the home after the bodies were found and subsequently found two \u201cplastic bags containing white powdery substances,\u201d one of which contained cocaine after being tested, according to Zahnd. The probable cause statement alleges Willis \u201cwas determined to be the major contributor of DNA found on that bag.\u201d \nThe other bag contained fentanyl, with Carson\u2019s DNA found to be the primary contributor on that bag, he continued, citing the probable cause statement. \nCarson is being held in the Platte County jail in lieu of a $100,000 case bond, Zahnd said, while \u201cwe\u2019ve been told that Mr. Willis is going to surrender himself on the warrant issued for his arrest and that he will post a $100,000 case bond.\u201d \nWillis\u2019 lawyer, John Picerno, said there is no evidence that Willis bought the drugs that his friends ingested before their deaths, noting they had been partying all day, the Associated Press reported. And he said Willis didn\u2019t know that they were still in his backyard \u2014 or that they needed medical attention \u2014 until police showed up, according to the AP. \n\u201cIt has been a very, very long year for Jordan,\u201d Picerno told the AP. \u201cHe\u2019s lost his job. He\u2019s lost his home. He\u2019s lost his friends. The public are pointing at him as someone who essentially killed them. And nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d \nNo attorney is listed for Carson in online court records. \n##  \u2018It takes time to bring these cases,\u2019 prosecutor says \nMcGeeney\u2019s fianc\u00e9e told police the three had gone to Willis\u2019 home the day of the Kansas City Chiefs football game on January 7, the last game of the regular season. But the three friends never came home. \nTwo days later, on January 9, McGeeney\u2019s fianc\u00e9e went looking for him at Willis\u2019 house after the families became increasingly worried about their lack of communication and she found \u201cat least one person dead on the back patio,\u201d said Zahnd. \nRicky Johnson/Facebook\nvideo \nRelated video Kansas City Chiefs fans found dead outside home days after game\nKansas City had a high of 37 degrees and a low of 29 degrees with trace amounts of rain and snow on January 7, and temperatures dropped to right around freezing just before sunrise the next morning. \nJennifer Marquez, McGeeney\u2019s mother, told CNN in January 2024 her son\u2019sfianc\u00e9e told her what happened that day: \u201cShe told me that she tried the doors, tried the gate, and eventually just \u2014 her phone was saying that Clayton was there. You know, it was pinging off his phone \u2026 So she knew something was up.\u201d \nAccording to Marquez, after no one answered the door, the woman removed a screen and broke into the house through a window. A police statement said she \u201cbroke into the basement.\u201d \nEventually, she called the Kansas City police. According to a police statement, officers \u201cresponded to the back porch and confirmed there was a dead body. Upon further investigation, officers located two other dead bodies in the back yard.\u201d \nPolice said at the time they found \u201cno obvious signs of foul play.\u201d \nThe police statement said that \u201cthe resident at the house was cooperative with detectives the day the deceased were discovered.\u201d \nZahnd said Wednesday the probable cause affidavit recounts a statement of a witness who said he was at Harrington\u2019s home with him and McGeeney, Johnson and Willis the night of the football game where he saw \u201ca large plate of cocaine allegedly supplied by Mr. Willis that everyone was using.\u201d The witness said the three friends were headed to Willis\u2019 house after the game, Zahnd said. \nAnother witness who left before midnight said he was with Willis, Harrington, McGeeney and Johnson at Willis\u2019 home later on in the evening where they drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and used cocaine, Zahnd said. \nData recovered from Harrington\u2019s phone allegedly contains text messages between Harrington, McGeeney, Johnson, Willis, Carson and others consistent with the \u201cpurchase and use of cocaine.\u201d \nThe messages allegedly indicate Carson supplied Harrington with cocaine, Zahnd said. \nKansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said at the Wednesday news conference: \u201cThis is a message to those that are bringing fentanyl into our communities providing it to people, harming our community \u2013 that you will be held accountable, you will be arrested, and you will be charged.\u201d \nWhen asked why the investigation took over a year, Zahnd said: \u201cIt takes time to bring these cases and there are additional investigative things that had to be wrapped up before this case could be brought.\u201d \n_CORRECTION: A photo caption on a previous version of this story misstated when the three men were found dead.

The most obvious difference is in the rear camera. While the iPhone 15 has two lenses (one wide and one ultra-wide), the iPhone 16e has a single 48-megapixel wide lens. Because of this, the camera module is significantly smaller, which probably helped Apple put a bigger battery in the iPhone 16e.\niPhone 16e uses the same system based on low-voltage electric current to remove and replace the internal battery, which makes the process much easier and safer. Interestingly, the teardown shows that the battery has 4005 mAh of capacity \u2013 more than was previously reported by some YouTubers. For comparison, the iPhone 16 battery has 3561 mAh.\nWhen it comes to the Face ID module, it\u2019s pretty much identical to the one in the iPhone 14 as the new iPhone 16e features a notch instead of the Dynamic Island.\nThe teardown also shows the C1 chip, Apple\u2019s first 5G modem. It combines 4 nanometer baseband technology with 7 nanometer transceiver technology. As previously revealed by a lab test, the new modem is much more efficient and uses less power than the Qualcomm modems in other iPhones.\nYou can watch the full teardown below:\niPhone 16e starts at $599 for the 128GB version.

Ali", "Elon Musk"], "text": "# Secretary of State Rubio says purge of USAID programs complete, with 83% of agency\u2019s programs gone\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday the Trump administration had finished its six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, cutting 83% of them, and said he would move the remaining aid programs under the State Department.\nHours later, a federal judge said President Donald Trump had overstepped his authority in shutting down most foreign assistance, saying the administration could no longer simply sit on the billions of dollars that Congress had provided for foreign aid. But Judge Amir H. Ali stopped short of ordering Trump officials to use the money to revive the thousands of terminated program contracts.\nRubio made his announcement Monday in a post on X, in one of his few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at State and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams. \nRubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid. \nTrump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda. \nRubio's social media post Monday said that review was now \u201cofficially ending,\" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated. Those programs \u201cspent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote.\nHe said about 1,000 remaining contracts would now be administered by the State Department.\nDemocratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.\nIn his preliminary injunction Monday, Ali said Trump could not simply ignore most of what is roughly $60 billion in foreign assistance funding that was given to USAID and State by Congress, which under the U.S. Constitution has authority to spend money.\n\u201cThe constitutional power over whether to spend foreign aid is not the President\u2019s own \u2014 and it is Congress\u2019s own,\u201d Ali wrote.\nBut Ali declined the request from nonprofit groups and businesses to revive the canceled contracts for foreign assistance work around the world, saying it was up to the administration to make decisions on specific contracts. \nAli also ordered Trump officials to keep paying all of the billions of dollars it owed to aid groups and businesses up to mid-February, and ordered them to do it at a pace of at least 300 back payments a day.\nAli's ruling came after the Supreme Court had rejected the Trump administration's appeal in the case.\nUSAID supporters said the sweep of the cuts made it difficult to tell what U.S. efforts abroad the Trump administration actually supports. \n\u201cThe patterns that are emerging is the administration does not support democracy programs, they don\u2019t support civil society \u2026 they don\u2019t support NGO programs,\u201d or health or emergency response, said Andrew Natsios, the USAID administrator for Republican former President George W. Bush.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s left\u201d?\u201d Natsios asked.\nThe Trump administration gave almost no details on which aid and development efforts abroad it spared as it mass-emailed contract terminations to aid groups and other USAID partners by the thousands within days earlier this month. The rapid pace, and the steps skipped in ending contracts, left USAID supporters challenging whether any actual program-by-program reviews had taken place. \nAid groups say even some life-saving programs that Rubio and others had promised to spare are in limbo or terminated, such as those providing emergency nutritional support for starving children and drinking water for sprawling camps for families uprooted by war in Sudan. \nRepublicans broadly have made clear they want foreign assistance that would promote a far narrower interpretation of U.S. national interests going forward.\nThe State Department in one of multiple lawsuits it is battling over its rapid shutdown of USAID had said earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower.\nThe dismantling of USAID that followed Trump's order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill. \nIn the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands. \nContractors and staffers running efforts ranging from epidemic control to famine prevention to job and democracy training stopped work. Aid groups and other USAID partners laid off tens of thousands of their workers in the U.S. and abroad.\nThe shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting back payments and travel expenses to return home. \nThe Trump administration on Monday gave USAID staffers abroad until April 6 to move back to the United States if they want to do so on the government\u2019s tab, according to a USAID email sent to staffers and seen by The Associated Press. Staffers say the deadline gives them scant time to pull children from school, sell homes or break leases, and, for many, find somewhere to live after years away from the United States. \nIn Washington, the sometimes contradictory orders issued by the three men \u2014 Rubio, Musk and Marocco \u2014 overseeing the USAID cuts have left many uncertain who was calling the shots, and fueled talk of power struggles.\nMusk and Rubio on Monday, as Trump had last week, insisted relations between the two of them were smooth. \n\u201cGood working with you,\u201d Musk tweeted in response to Rubio's announcement. \n\u201cTough, but necessary,\u201d Musk wrote of Rubio's announcement on the cuts.\n___\nAssociate Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst contributed.\nThe post Secretary of State Rubio says purge of USAID programs complete, with 83% of agency\u2019s programs gone first appeared on Federal News Network.", "title": "Secretary Rubio finalized Trump's USAID program cuts, eliminating 83% of initiatives, while a federal judge ruled the administration overstepped constitutional spending authority, leaving critical foreign aid programs terminated despite legal challenges.", "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the completion of the Trump administration's six-week purge of USAID programs, eliminating 83% (approximately 5,200 out of 6,200) of the agency's programs.

So that's really what the characteristic of need statement is all about.\u201d\nThe Army released the characteristics of need for NGC2 in mid-December. It is a precursor to a bigger multi-year effort to update and standardize command and control across the service.\nThe Army Futures Command is taking on the job to create the requirements documents to meet the end goals defined by Command and Control Cross Functional Team. The futures command then will provide those documents to the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications and Networks (PEO-C3N) for the solutions.\nThis multi-organization effort is a recognition that building the next generation of command and control is a lot more difficult and complex than previous development efforts.\nWelch said with the range of technology solutions available and the idea that needs and technologies will continually evolve, NGC2 must be agile enough to meet the needs of commanders and soldiers as they emerge.\n## Always incorporating lessons\nThe Army has been working on NGC2 for much of the past two years, releasing the first version of the characteristics of need in late spring 2024 and then using an exercise called NetModX to help further refine the document.\nThe current approach to command and control is disparate and lacks interoperability. A common complaint among commanders is they don\u2019t train as they would fight, which means learning new systems and capabilities in theater.\nWelch said the characteristics of need is a living document and will continue to evolve as the Army tests out new technologies and processes.\n\u201cThe single biggest thing that I think that we learned through this experimentation that we did back in the fall called NetModX is if you think about different war fighting functions and the data and information needed to support those and how they come together for a commander, the need to provide more rapid situational understanding to be able to make more rapid decisions,\u201d Welch said on Ask the CIO. \u201cWe had some experimentation with that earlier in the year at Project Convergence, Capstone Four, what we hadn't done yet is put it over what I'll call a representative network, the type of processing, compute network solutions, radio solutions, the way that we manage those bits and bytes on the battlefield. We really hadn't kind of coupled those things together yet. We did that at NetModX, and it just drove home the challenges that we saw there.\u201d\nThe Army Futures Command took those lessons and updated characteristics of need that incorporates the need for a more cohesive technology stack that stretches from the data to the applications to the transport.\nWelch said the characteristics of need included a new section to signal the importance of not piecemealing the NGC2 solution together.\n## Army TEM 14 is coming\nWhen it comes to the NGC2 technology stack, Welch said the application layer has to be focused on the user\u2019s needs.\n\u201cOne thing that modern applications have in common most of the time is that you don't really need a whole lot of training in order to get started on it. When you download an app onto your phone, generally, you're able to start using it even if you haven't done it before because that's a very highly specialized skill set in order to make something intuitive right to understand. That has been in the characteristic of need from the first one that we did back in May, the level of intuitiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get that piece right, then all the other layers below it that help support that.\u201d\nWith a goal of implementing the initial capabilities of NGC2 by 2026, Welch said much of the next year will focus on piloting and prototyping technologies and processes with a host of vendors.\nThe Army is hosting Technical Exchange Meeting (TEM) 14 in Grapevine, Texas where it will meet with vendors about the acquisition strategy, the technology roadmap and technology discriminators. The Army released a request for information to help decide which vendors to meet with. Responses are due by March 19.\nWelch said the pilots and prototypes are focused both on technology as well as how the Army works with teams of vendors in that space.\n\u201cWhat we're about to move into with the acquisition team is what they're what they're talking about as a prototype. We're going to be building that to a bit of a larger scale, working with contract processes that are that are that are built to handle that larger scale, keeping our options open to learn from that and iterate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're trying to move very quickly, but we are also keeping our decision space open, especially in this very important area of how we're going to continue to contract for this activity, so that we can incorporate the lessons that we have learned when we get to kind of the initial, larger scale capability in 2026 before we start really expanding that out to much more of the Army.\u201d\nThe post How the Futures Command is helping Army to envision NGC2 first appeared on Federal News Network.", "title": "Joe Welch of the Army Futures Command outlines the evolving NGC2 development strategy prioritizing industry collaboration, agile technology integration, and intuitive command systems through iterative prototyping and vendor partnerships.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "The US Army is developing the next generation command and control system (NGC2) through a novel approach, focusing on the end result rather than a predetermined solution.

The initiative will see a series of TSMC chipmaking plants built in Arizona, with some of the production reserved for Apple chips for older devices.\nThe project has been beset with delays and uncertainties. Mass production at the first plant was due to start last year and was then pushed back to this year.\nThere were question marks over whether raw chips fabricated in the US would need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging (the name given to combining individual chips into the type of System-On-a-Chip combo used by Apple). \nFurther questions were raised about the promised US jobs, with many employees recruited from Taiwan, and the company even being accused of \u201canti-American discrimination.\u201d\n## Questions remain about the $100B investment\nThe Trump administration announced the $100B investment ahead of TSMC\u2019s confirmation, and is presented as if it\u2019s new money. However, as the plan had always been for a succession of Arizona plants, it\u2019s unclear whether some or all of the $100B was already in the budget even if not formally announced.\nOne element that does appear to be new is the promise of US-based chip-packaging facilities. The company had previously been expected to contract out this work to another company, Amkor. However, it may well be the case that this merely shifts the packaging work from one US facility to another.\n## May be a step backwards for US Apple chips\nOne of the biggest limitations of the deal had always been that Apple relies on TSMC\u2019s most advanced processes, which are only available in its Taiwanese plants. The company was never going to bring its smallest processes to the US, meaning the Arizona plants could only make chips for older Apple devices. The plan was to keep the US plants a few generations behind those in Taiwan.\nApple analyst suggests that the latest deal involves losing one of the most advanced plants, which would further limit the ability to make Apple chips in the US.\n> TSMC\u2019s newly announced US investment plan [involves] cutting one advanced-node fab, and including an extra advanced packaging plant and R&D center.\nThis could mean US chips suitable even for older Apple devices will be in shorter supply.\nKuo also notes that the planned spend is \u201cflexible.\u201d\n> Though the $100 billion investment seems massive, the lack of details provides the flexibility for spending based on future conditions.\n## Highlighted accessories\n_Photo by on_\n_FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links._ More.\nYou\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

In somewhat of a surprise, the new entry iPad doesn\u2019t support Apple Intelligence\u2014an omission that\u2019s perhaps passable for a budget device, but that makes the iPhone SE\u2019s recent discontinuation all the more perplexing.\n## A16 iPad prioritizes cost above all else, including AI support\nOver the past year, Apple has been steadily updating much of its product line with support for Apple Intelligence.\n  * The full iPhone 16 line supports AI features, including the new iPhone 16e.\n  * Macs have long had the specs necessary for Apple Intelligence, but got a recent AI boost nonetheless by making 16GB of RAM standard for new models.\n  * Powerful updates to the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini last year clearly had AI in mind too.\n\n\nBut now, Apple\u2019s latest entry iPad has arrived with no Apple Intelligence. It uses an A16 chip, just one generation removed from the A17 Pro that does support AI.\nClearly, Apple felt that its entry $349 iPad didn\u2019t need AI. Perhaps internal research showed the device\u2019s target market would be fine without those features.\nSince the base iPad\u2019s most important feature is its price, I don\u2019t exactly disagree with the decision.\nBut it really makes me wonder: why didn\u2019t the same thing happen with the iPhone SE?\n## iPhone SE could have lived on without AI, existing alongside the iPhone 16e\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone 16e at $599, it chose to leave the budget smartphone market behind.\nBased on the company\u2019s marketing, the reason was clear: Apple Intelligence support was crucial to the device.\nThus, the company gave its new iPhone a modern A18 chip, 8GB of RAM, and made AI possible\u2014despite the higher price these upgrades brought along.\nOffering an iPhone 16 \u2018Lite\u2019 model, such as the 16e, isn\u2019t a bad idea. I\u2019m all for experimentation.\nBut Apple could have done so without dropping the budget model altogether.\nIt could have kept selling the previous iPhone SE.\nSure, the iPhone SE would likely have needed a USB-C port rather than Lightning. And maybe it could have gotten another small tweak or two.\nBut Apple mostly could have left the device alone, dropped its price a bit to $399, and retained an option for buyers on a tight budget.\nUntil now, I\u2019d assumed the reason that hadn\u2019t happened was the need for Apple Intelligence on all new hardware.\nSurely if Apple keeps rolling out new AI features all the time, the company must want to move its users on to AI-supported products as quickly as possible.\nOr so I thought. But the A16 iPad seems to prove that explanation wrong.\n## AI product confusion in Apple\u2019s lineup\nFor whatever reason, Apple has decided that the same rules it applied to the iPhone SE decision aren\u2019t relevant to the entry iPad. Personally though, I\u2019m stumped as to why.\n## Top comment by Augusto Galindo\nLiked by 4 people \nConsidering at this point, most of Apple\u2019s useful AI features are just shortcuts to ChatGPT, users don\u2019t really need that. You might say in the long term Apple could add more on device features, yes that is true, but they will likely be limited to newer processors and an A17 Pro will be a waste anyway.\nThe A11 for instance, was the first Apple processor to feature a Neural Engine, but it didn\u2019t receive any of the ML features that almost any iPhone with the A12 or superior received. Something similar will happen in this AI era. A17/A18 are not even the beginning.\nView all comments\nIf anything, bringing Apple Intelligence to the entry iPad seems more important since it\u2019s used a lot in education markets that would benefit from features like Writing Tools and ChatGPT integration.\nMaybe Apple has just decided that $400 is too low for an iPhone in 2025. I could understand that, especially if price hikes are coming to the iPhone 17 lineup.\nUltimately though, we just don\u2019t know. Apple doesn\u2019t have to explain its product decisions, and we don\u2019t have to understand why one device needs AI and another doesn\u2019t.\nWhy do you think Apple discontinued the iPhone SE but kept its budget iPad without AI?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stands against the other cheap gold stocks to invest in right now.\n## The Insatiable Demand for Gold Across the Globe\nThe World Gold Council said in its annual report that the global demand for gold hit a record high in 2024, fueled by investment demand growth and robust central bank purchases. Total gold transactions reached 4,974 tons in 2024, up from 4,899 tons in 2023, including over-the-counter (OTC) investments. Central banks are exhibiting an \u201cinsatiable\u201d appetite for gold. The Council said they have attained a significant milestone, maintaining a continuously solid pace of gold purchases. The buying exceeded 1,000 tons for the third consecutive year in 2024.\nThe National Bank of Poland took the lead as the largest net central bank gold purchaser, adding 90 tons to its reserves. The Central Bank of Turkey added 75 tons, making it the second-largest net purchaser of gold among the world\u2019s central banks. The Reserve Bank of India took the third spot with consistent gold purchases every month, except December. Gold demand in India rose after the government slashed gold import duties, bringing them down to 6% from 15%. In addition, gold investment demand increased across all ASEAN markets in 2024, with Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand reflecting double-digit year-over-year increases.\nCNBC reported that Shaokai Fan, global head of central banks at the World Gold Council, said the following about the situation:\n> \u201cIn 2024, global gold demand surged to a new quarterly high and a record annual total bolstered by heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\u201d\n**READ ALSO:10 Cheap Internet Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Virtual Reality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.**\n## Are Overall Investments in Gold Increasing?\nThe annual overall investments in gold are experiencing an increase, rising to 25% and hitting a four-year high of 1,180 tons. This growth was primarily attributed to gold exchange-traded funds. CNBC reported that the demand for gold coins and bars remained firm, boosted by growing demand from India and China. The World Gold Council report said that Chinese investors \u201cfaced a dearth of alternative assets in which to invest.\u201d Therefore, the significant factors that supported investors\u2019 inclination toward gold included persistent equity market volatility, domestic economic uncertainty, and record-low government bond yields.\nIn addition to regional increases in gold investments, OTC investments also remained stable in 2024. OTC transactions occur between two parties directly instead of trading managed by an exchange. The Council said that the demand reflects attempts by individuals with high net worth to hedge economic and geopolitical risks.\n## The Gold Jewelry Sector and the 2025 Gold Outlook\nIn contrast to the demand for gold, the jewelry sector showed an opposite scenario in terms of demand. Consumption in the jewelry sector fell 11% year-over-year, primarily pressured by higher prices. The report showed and CNBC reported that this sector was the only outlier, as other sectors gained. According to the Council\u2019s analysts, with consumer spending power pressured by soft economic growth and rising prices, demand for gold jewelry is anticipated to stay weak in 2025. CNBC reported that Louise Street, World Gold Council senior markets analyst, gave the following 2025 outlook for the sector:\n> \u201cIn 2025, we expect central banks to remain in the driving seat and gold ETF investors to join the fray, especially if we see lower, albeit volatile interest rates.\u201d\nThe report also said that overall investment demand is expected to remain healthy in 2025, with anticipated lower interest rates to slash the opportunity costs of holding gold.\n### **Our Methodology**\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of gold stocks with forward P/E less than 15.

The World Gold Council report said that Chinese investors \u201cfaced a dearth of alternative assets in which to invest.\u201d Therefore, the significant factors that supported investors\u2019 inclination toward gold included persistent equity market volatility, domestic economic uncertainty, and record-low government bond yields.\nIn addition to regional increases in gold investments, OTC investments also remained stable in 2024. OTC transactions occur between two parties directly instead of trading managed by an exchange. The Council said that the demand reflects attempts by individuals with high net worth to hedge economic and geopolitical risks.\n## The Gold Jewelry Sector and the 2025 Gold Outlook\nIn contrast to the demand for gold, the jewelry sector showed an opposite scenario in terms of demand. Consumption in the jewelry sector fell 11% year-over-year, primarily pressured by higher prices. The report showed and CNBC reported that this sector was the only outlier, as other sectors gained. According to the Council\u2019s analysts, with consumer spending power pressured by soft economic growth and rising prices, demand for gold jewelry is anticipated to stay weak in 2025. CNBC reported that Louise Street, World Gold Council senior markets analyst, gave the following 2025 outlook for the sector:\n> \u201cIn 2025, we expect central banks to remain in the driving seat and gold ETF investors to join the fray, especially if we see lower, albeit volatile interest rates.\u201d\nThe report also said that overall investment demand is expected to remain healthy in 2025, with anticipated lower interest rates to slash the opportunity costs of holding gold.\n### **Our Methodology**\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of gold stocks with forward P/E less than 15.

It serves as a new entry point to the iPhone lineup, and replaces the family. While the iPhone 16e has a number of big upgrades over the that it replaced, there are some smaller ones that might\u2019ve slipped under the radar.\niPhone 16e starts at $599 with 128GB of storage. It brought a 6.1\u2033 OLED display, Face ID, USB-C, Apple Intelligence, the action button, and much more down to Apple\u2019s entry level iPhone. It\u2019s a flashy new phone with a number of great upgrades over its predecessor. However, I\u2019d like to focus on the smaller ones.\n## Satellite connectivity\nIntroduced with the iPhone 14 lineup, iPhone 16e now supports Apple\u2019s full suite of satellite connectivity features. That includes Emergency SOS via Satellite, Roadside Assistance via satellite, and Messages via satellite.\nThese are features that ideally you\u2019d never have to use, but if you do \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly handy to have. never supported this feature set.\nWith the purchase of an iPhone 16e, you receive 2 years of free satellite connectivity. Unfortunately, we still don\u2019t know what it\u2019ll cost after the free trial period. Apple opted to offer an additional free year for those who purchased an iPhone 14 early on.\n## Crash Detection\nContinuing the theme of \u201cjust in case safety features that you\u2019ll hopefully never need to use\u201d \u2013 iPhone 16e also supports crash detection. Thanks to the high-g accelerometer, Apple can now tell when you\u2019ve been in a car crash, and call emergency services for you if you\u2019re unresponsive. This feature can save lives.\n## Water resistance improvements\niPhone 16e features IP68 water resistance, allowing you to use your iPhone underwater up to 6 meters deep for 30 minutes or less. This is a vast improvement over the , which only supported IP67. With IP67 water resistance, you could only use your iPhone up to 1 meter underwater for up to 30 minutes.\n## Optical zoom support\niPhone 16e equips an all new 48MP sensor. Ever since Apple introduced the first 48MP sensor on iPhone 14 Pro, its supported a feature to take 2x optical zoom photos with the main sensor.\nEssentially, Apple crops in on the middle 12MP of the larger 48MP sensor, allowing for each pixel to be properly represented in a photo. You may disagree on whether or not this methodology should count as optical zoom, but one way or another, it\u2019s a lot better quality than a normal digital zoom photo, which would ordinarily be under 12MP.\n## Night mode photography\nApple debuted night mode with the iPhone 11 lineup. This allowed users to take better photos at night, thanks to a longer processing algorithm. Despite the second and \u2018s debuting after the introduction of this feature, they never gained support for night mode.\niPhone 16e does support night mode though, allowing Apple\u2019s latest entry-level iPhone to take much better photos when its dark out.\nWhat do you think of Apple\u2019s new iPhone 16e?

From the suit: \" Apple claims to have retired 485,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents primarily through two offsetting projects: the Chyulu Hills Project in Kenya and the Guinan Project in China.\" According to the plaintiffs, Apple's carbon neutrality claims are \"false and misleading.\"\n\"The Chyulu Hills Project purports to generate carbon credits by preventing deforestation on land which has been legally protected from deforestation since 1983,\" the suit reads, \"while the Guinan Project claims to have planted trees on 'barren land' that was already heavily forested before the project began.\"\nThe lawsuit says that in both cases \"the carbon reductions would have occurred regardless of Apple\u2019s involvement or the projects\u2019 existence,\" and as such Apple's carbon neutrality claims, which are \"predicated on the efficacy and legitimacy of these projects,\" are false and misleading.\nThe suit goes on to claim that consumers have suffered economic injury and would not have bought the products, or paid as much for them, if they had known \"that Apple\u2019s 'carbon neutral' representations were false.\"\n## Apple hits back\nHere's how Apple demonstrates the reduction in emissions for the Apple Watch Series 9, including using carbon credits to achieve 'net zero'. (Image credit: Apple)\n\"We are proud of our carbon neutral products, which are the result of industry-leading innovation in clean energy and low-carbon design,\" Apple told TechRadar in a defiant statement. \"We\u2019ve drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75 percent, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air. That innovation and progress is important to us and to the planet, which is why we detail our work prominently and transparently for our users.\"\nApple, as is to be expected, did not address the specific claims about the efficacy and legitimacy of the two named projects in the lawsuit, a discussion that will play out in court should the case come to fruition and end up going to trial.\nAs we've previously noted, there's plenty of public information about the questions around carbon credit programs. A report from The Guardian has previously suggested that some such programs are \"worthless.\" Similarly, the New Climate Institute claimed that \"Carbon credits cannot be considered an equivalent alternative to the reduction of companies\u2019 own emissions,\" dubbing the practice \"highly contentious.\" The NCI claims \"the use of certificates from such projects is simply not a feasible solution for truly neutralising emissions,\" noting that carbon storage in forestry and land-use projects \"is likely to only be temporary\" because of forest fires and other disturbances.\nThe lawsuit lays bare the main issue with Apple's carbon neutrality claims. Any product that requires manufacture and distribution will have a carbon footprint that is impossible to eliminate totally, so any 'carbon neutral' push will inevitably have to rely on offsetting. As such, the efficacy and integrity of those programs will always underpin whether using a carbon neutral claim is justified.\n### You may also like\n  * Apple doesn\u2019t think prioritizing repairability is always good for the environment \u2013 and it might be right\n  * 'Apple Watch bands are safe for users to wear' \u2013 company responds to class-action lawsuit over 'forever chemical' claims\n  * Acer shows Apple how environmentalism is done with pledge to collect equivalent of 2.5 million plastic bottles with Plastic Bank partnership", "title": "Apple is accused of misleading consumers with carbon neutral claims for its latest Apple Watches, relying on disputed offset projects, while the company defends its environmental initiatives through emission reductions and investments in carbon removal programs.", "summary": "Apple faces a class action lawsuit in the Northern District of California over _false and misleading_ claims that its Apple Watch Ultra 2, SE 2, and Series 9 are carbon neutral.

Overview\nManaging empty spaces efficiently is a common challenge in parking lots, retail shelves, and warehouses. This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 on Jetson Nano to detect and count empty spaces in real-time, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution powered by edge AI.\nIn my previous blogs, _\"Get Started With Jetson Nano Developer Kit:_https://www.hackster.io/pattshibang/get-started-with-jetson-nano-developer-kit-281c38 _\"_ and _\"Running YOLOv12 on Jetson Nano 4GB: A Comprehensive Guide:_https://www.hackster.io/pattshibang/running-yolov12-on-jetson-nano-4gb-a-comprehensive-guide-f9042e _, \"_ we explored the basics of setting up the Jetson Nano and running the YOLOv12 model for object detection. Additionally, in _\"Fall Detection on Jetson Nano: Customizing YOLOv8:_https://www.hackster.io/pattshibang/fall-detection-on-jetson-nano-customizing-yolov8-f10879 _, \"_ we delved into customizing YOLOv8 for a specific use case. Building on that foundation, we will now explore _Real-Time Empty Space Detection & Counting with YOLOv8._\nYOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8)  Is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. Its ability to quickly and accurately identify objects in real-time makes it an ideal choice for empty space detection applications. By customizing YOLOv8, we can train the model to specifically recognize _Empty Space_ , enhancing its effectiveness.\nThe Jetson Nano, a powerful yet affordable edge AI platform developed by NVIDIA, is an excellent choice for deploying YOLOv8-based empty space detection systems. Its compact size, low power consumption, and robust GPU capabilities make it well-suited for running complex AI models at the edge.\n2.Hardware Configuration\nHardware Configuration\n3. Software Configuration 4.Preparing the Dataset\nIn this tutorial we used Roboflow dataset  as shows in the figure.\nRoboflow available storage dataset\nDownload the dataset with your desire format as shows on this figure.\nThe dataset is well-organized and includes images annotated in JSON format, divided into three categories: train (494 images), test(74 images), and valid(140 images). It features three classes (available_1, available_2, available_3). The YAML file and additional text files provide configuration settings and instructions to facilitate the use of the dataset in machine learning workflows.\n5.Training the Model\nTo train YOLOv8 or later versions (as YOLOv8 is an Ultralytics product), refer to the Ultralytics documentation () for detailed instructions. Customizing YOLOv8 with an Empty Space dataset, as demonstrated in the _Real-Time Empty Space Detection & Counting with YOLOv8_ tutorial, involves training YOLOv8 on a specific target dataset tailored to your application.\n5.1. **Configuring the Training Environment** :\n  * Use the provided YAML file to configure the training parameters. This file will include paths to the dataset on your computer, number of classes, and other necessary settings.\n  * An example YAML configuration might look like this:\n\n```\ntrain: /path/to/train/imagesval: /path/to/valid/imagestest:/path/to/valid/imagesnc: 3 # Number of classesnames: [available_1, available_2, available_3]\n```\n\n5.2.

In the classic VU meter design is used a moving needle (actually a sensitive galvanometer) that points to a scale on a calibrated range.\nThe needle moves left or right depending on the strength of the audio signal. I recently acquired these small round TFT displays with a GC9A01 chip. Its basic purpose is for making smart watches, but in fact their shape is ideally suited for making a retro-look VU meter. My attention was drawn to a project on blog, which describes in detail how to create meters gauges and dials on this display with arduino nano.\nFor the needs of this project I made some modifications to the code but basically kept the beautiful retro design and colors. Now, instead of random values, the instrument shows the real values \u200b\u200bof the voltage applied to the input pin of the microcontroller. For a more homogeneous movement of the needle, I now use a more powerful ESP32 microcontroller.\nThis project is sponsored by y( ). This year,  is organizing the 11th badge design contest from March 3rd to April 31st. Follow the design requirements and Submit your designs in one of the given ways, and become the winner of one of the valuable prizes in cash and cupons. This contest is more than a competition\u2014it\u2019s a celebration of 11 years of innovation and a chance to dream about the boundless possibilities ahead with .\nNowadays the price of ESP32 is very low, so for better separation of the channels I decided to use a separate microcontroller for each channel. In this project I also added a peak meter that signals the moment of exceeding the permitted level of the signal with an LED.\nThe device is very simple to make and consists of several components:\n  * ESP32 microcontroller - two pieces\n  * Two round displays with GC9A01 and 240x240 resolution\n  * envelope followers made with two small signal diodes and two capacitors\n  * and two leds with current limiting resistors\n\n\nIn particular, in this case I use the simplest passive envelope follower consisting of a diode and a capacitor, because the whole device is mainly intended as a demo device for testing, and based on this idea, a precise, fully functional audio VU meter can be made later with certain software and hardware modifications.\nAnd now let's see how this VU meter works in real conditions.\nLet me mention that a stereo potentiometer can be placed on the input in order to regulate the signal level, but for the sake of simplification I do it with the Windows mixer software.\nAnd finally a short conclusion: This small, simple and interesting arduino project can be made in a few hours, and has a beautiful retro look, so you can use it as an additional part of any audio device, or as a stand-alone unit. With minimal code modification it can be used on many other devices (eg radio receiver) where signal strength measurement is required. The Vu meter is built in a suitable plastic box made of PVC material and lined with self-adhesive colored wallpaper.\n## Schematics \n### Schematic\n...\n## Code \n### code Left channel\nC/C++\n...\n```\n// GCA901_Nano_voltage_meter\n// \n// grid voltage variation monitor (230V - 250V AC)\n// rolling averaged voltage (of 10 readings) is sent to display\n// NOTE: here voltage generated with random function\n//\n// microcontroller: Arduino Nano\n// display 240*240 circular SPI 3.3V TFT with GC9A01 controller\n// \n// note: random function drives fluctuations of the parameter named 'volt'\n// CG9A01  Arduino Nano\n// RST -------- NC\n// CST -------- 10\n// DC --------- 9\n// SDA -------- 11 - green wire\n// SCL -------- 13 - yellow wire\n// \n// Floris Wouterlood\n// September 1, 2023\n// public domain\n// made for a 240*240 pixel circular display\n// all x-y-coordinates relative to center = x = 120 and y = 120\n#include\"SPI.h\"\n#include\"Adafruit_GFX.h\"\n#include\"Adafruit_GC9A01A.h\"\n#define TFT_DC 2\n#define TFT_CS 15\nAdafruit_GC9A01Atft(TFT_CS,TFT_DC);\n#define BLACK   0x0000                                // some extra colors\n#define BLUE    0x001F\n#define RED    0xF800\n#define GREEN   0x07E0\n#define CYAN    0x07FF\n#define MAGENTA  0xF81F\n#define YELLOW   0xFFE0\n#define WHITE   0xFFFF\n#define ORANGE   0xFBE0\n#define GREY    0x84B5\n#define BORDEAUX  0xA000\n#define AFRICA   0xAB21        // 0xce5f //0xAB21                                // current dial color\nconstintvlez=34;\n#define DEG2RAD 0.0174532925 \n//int vlez;\nintsig=0;\nintmultiplier;\nintframetime=100;\nintx_pos;\ninty_pos;\nintcenter_x=120;// center x of dial on 240*240 TFT display\nintcenter_y=120;// center y of dial on 240*240 TFT display\nfloatpivot_x,pivot_y,pivot_x_old,pivot_y_old;\nfloatp1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,p3_x,p3_y,p4_x,p4_y,p5_x,p5_y;\nfloatp1_x_old,p1_y_old,p2_x_old,p2_y_old,p3_x_old,p3_y_old;\nfloatp4_x_old,p4_y_old,p5_x_old,p5_y_old;\nfloatangleOffset=3.14;\nfloatarc_x;\nfloatarc_y;\nintradius=120;// center y of circular scale                          \nfloatangle_circle=0;\nfloatneedleAngle=0;\nintiteration=0;\nintj;\nfloatvolt=220;\nintneedle_multiplier=1;\nfloatneedle_setter;\nfloatcurrentNeedleValue=230;// Start with a base voltage or level\nfloatneedleSpeed=10;// Speed at which the needle returns to the left\n// to start with\nvoidsetup(){\n//randomSeed (analogRead(0)); \npinMode(12,OUTPUT);\npinMode(vlez,INPUT);\ntft.begin();\nSerial.begin(9600);\nSerial.println(\"\");\nSerial.println(\"\");\ntft.setRotation(0);\ntft.fillScreen(BLACK);\ntft.drawCircle(center_x,center_y,120,BLACK);\npivot_x=center_x;\npivot_y=center_y+50;\np1_x_old=center_x;p1_y_old=center_y+50;\np2_x_old=center_x;p2_y_old=center_y+50;\np3_x_old=center_x;p3_y_old=center_y+50;\np4_x_old=center_x;p4_y_old=center_y+50;\np5_x_old=center_x;p5_y_old=center_y+30;\ncreate_dial();\nneedle_setter=volt;\nneedleAngle=(((needle_setter)*DEG2RAD*1.8)-3.14);\nneedle();\ndraw_pivot();\n}\nvoidloop(){\n// Map the analog input (voltage) to the needle range\nfloattargetNeedleValue=map(analogRead(vlez),0,400,230,270);\nSerial.println(targetNeedleValue);\nsig=analogRead(vlez);\nif(sig>280){digitalWrite(12,HIGH);}else{digitalWrite(12,LOW);}\n// If the target value is greater than the current needle position, move quickly\nif(targetNeedleValue>currentNeedleValue){\ncurrentNeedleValue=targetNeedleValue;\n}\n// If the target value is lower, move more slowly to simulate damping\nelseif(targetNeedleValue<currentNeedleValue){\ncurrentNeedleValue-=needleSpeed;// Decrease the value gradually\nif(currentNeedleValue<targetNeedleValue){\ncurrentNeedleValue=targetNeedleValue;// Ensure we don't overshoot\n}\n}\n// Update the needle position\nneedle_setter=currentNeedleValue;\nneedle();\ndraw_pivot();\ndelay(frametime);// Control the update rate\n}\nvoidneedle(){// dynamic needle management\ntft.drawLine(pivot_x,pivot_y,p1_x_old,p1_y_old,AFRICA);// remove old needle \ntft.fillTriangle(p1_x_old,p1_y_old,p2_x_old,p2_y_old,p3_x_old,p3_y_old,AFRICA);// remove old arrow head\ntft.fillTriangle(pivot_x,pivot_y,p4_x_old,p4_y_old,p5_x_old,p5_y_old,AFRICA);// remove old arrow head\nneedleAngle=(((needle_setter)*0.017453", "title": "A retro-style ESP32 VU meter with GC9A01 round displays and peak LEDs, built using Arduino IDE and sponsored by y( ), measures audio signals via envelope followers for IoT and automotive applications.", "collected": 1744084101, "summary": "A Simple ESP32 VU Meter Project with Peak Meters on Round Displays\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis project creates a retro-look VU meter using an ESP32 microcontroller and a GC9A01 Round Display.

We expected a new iPhone SE, but we got the iPhone 16e, which sits at the same table as the other iPhone 16 models. It's not just the name, it's also the size, the chip that powers it, and a couple of other details that make the iPhone 16e a very interesting entrant into the iPhone 16 lineup. \nHowever, the iPhone 16e is also significantly more expensive than the (now discontinued) iPhone SE. Is it worth it, or should you just dish the extra cash for the \"real\" iPhone 16? Read on. \n## Apple iPhone 16e price\nThe iPhone 16e starts at $599 with 128GB of storage space. Increase that to 256GB and the price goes up to $699, and if you opt for the 512GB variant, the price jumps to $899. \nCompared to the old iPhone SE, which cost $429 when it came out in 2022, it's a big price increase. Given that the iPhone SE has been discontinued (alongside the iPhone 15), the cheapest new iPhone is now the 16e, and it's in a very different price range. \nSEE ALSO: iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16: What are the differences?\nOn the other hand, the iPhone 16e starts at 128GB of storage, which is double what you got with the last generation of the iPhone SE. And unlike the old SE, the iPhone 16e doesn't immediately scream \"old.\" Instead, it looks like and performs like a modern iPhone. \nThe display is a 6.1-inch OLED, very similar to the one on iPhone 16. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\nI reckon the pricing will incite mixed responses from potential buyers. Folks who will never pay more than five hundred bucks for a phone are now priced out. Others may be excited that they can get a \"real\" member of the iPhone 16 family for only $599. \n## Apple iPhone 16e design\nWhen I reviewed the iPhone SE, back in 2022, it was a very different experience. That phone looked dated compared to the top iPhones of the day, with a significantly smaller display and massive bezels on top and bottom. \nBut the iPhone 16e looks pretty great. On the front, it's basically an iPhone 14, with a large, 6.1-inch OLED display. There's no Dynamic Island on top; instead, you get the notch which hides the front camera, the Face ID camera, the speaker, and various sensors. \nOn the back, there's only a single camera coupled with a flash light. It's a big unit, though, and in an odd way it looks better (cleaner, at least) than the multi-camera arrays on more expensive iPhones. Only two colors are on offer, black and white. My review unit was white, and I loved both the matte white glass on the back, and the way the white frame contrasts with the dark display bezels on the front. \nThe frame is made of aluminum, and just like on the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e also gets the Action Button. It's nice of Apple to include it; I typically set it to perform one thing and never change it again, but it's better than the old switch. \nOverall, Apple struck the right balance with the iPhone 16e's design. It's a no-nonsense iPhone that doesn't look ancient, and it also doesn't look or feel cheap in any way. \nYou only get one camera. But it's a two-in-one. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\nApple also sent me a blue and a pink silicone case for the iPhone 16e. The light silicone cases are a good fit for the iPhone 16e, which, at 167 grams, is the lightest phone in the lineup. Compare it directly with any of the Pro models, and you'll feel a pretty big difference in weight. \nThere's one more thing to consider here, and that is size. At 6.1 inches, the iPhone 16e is essentially the same size as the iPhone 16 (it's a hair shorter, but you won't notice that). The iPhone SE was a far smaller phone, and with it out of the way, it means that Apple is no longer selling truly small phones.\n## Apple iPhone 16e performance and battery life\nMore than any other \"affordable\" Apple phone, the iPhone 16e strikes me as the businessman's phone. It looks good but not flashy. It performs, however, just as well as the iPhone 16, and it even beats it in a couple of very important ways. \nThe iPhone 16e has Apple's A18 chip inside; it's the same chip you'll find inside the iPhone 16, but it only has four GPU cores instead of five. You won't notice the difference. \nApple doesn't say how much RAM its phones have, but benchmarks indicate that the iPhone 16e comes with 8GB of RAM, just like the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro models. \nCombine that with 128GB of starting storage, and it means that the iPhone 16e performs pretty much the same as the iPhone 16. This was my experience, too: Everything felt fast, no matter how many apps I had open and which apps I used. Yes, even my favorite gaming benchmark, PUBG, was snappy on its highest settings. GeekBench scores confirmed this: with a 3201 single-core, 7423 multi-core score, the iPhone 16e is just a hair slower than the iPhone 16. \nYou don't get all the niceties of the Pro models, of course. The iPhone 16e doesn't have the ProMotion, 120Hz display, or the Dynamic Island, but none of these omissions are dealbrekers for me. \nTwo colors are on offer, both matte: White and black.  Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\nHere's a big selling point for the iPhone 16e: It has excellent battery life. Apple says it can handle up to 26 hours of video playback, compared to 22 hours on the iPhone 16. I couldn't compare the two devices directly, but during the week that I used it as my main phone, the iPhone 16e typically lasted two days after being fully charged, and that's with very heavy use. \nThis is partly thanks to Apple's C1 cellular chip, which made its debut in the iPhone 16e. The chip worked as intended for me; I never had problems with connectivity, calls or messages. If it can do that whilst adding a couple hours of battery life to the phone, it's a huge win. \nApple wouldn't be Apple, however, if it didn't throw a curveball at prospective buyers by removing MagSafe from the iPhone 16e. If you've never used it, you won't care. To me, it's a big deal; I use a bunch of MagSafe accessories, including Apple Wallet and wireless charging. The iPhone 16e does support wireless charging, though, so you should be able to get a decent experience with MagSafe accessories by using a MagSafe case. I couldn't get a sample case fast enough for this text, but once I get it, I'll definitely try it out and let you know how it works. \n## Apple iPhone 16e: Apple Intelligence\nBeing in Europe, I don't get to experience Apple Intelligence on an iPhone yet (it's coming in April). I've played with Apple Intelligence on the Mac, and while nothing seemed essential, the tools are fun and helpful and they'll probably become better over time. \nAI is extremely important for Apple (and, frankly, any other phone maker these days), so it actually makes sense that Apple made its \"cheap\" iPhone a bit more powerful than expected in order to give it full Apple Intelligence support. \nLightning port is out, USB-C is in. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\nI don't believe people are buying (or even should be buying) phones based on what type of AI features they support, at least not right now. I do suspect that, over time, these features will become as indispensable as having access to search or basic photo editing. In that sense, even if you're in Europe and don't have a good idea what AI on an iPhone is like, it's good to know that the iPhone 16e is fully future-proof when it comes to Apple Intelligence. \n## Apple iPhone 16e camera\nYou only get one, 48-megapixel camera on the back of the iPhone 16e. On paper, it's very similar to the one you get on the iPhone 16, though Apple calls this one a 2-in-1 camera system. That's because it can produce 24-megapixel or 48-megapixel wide photos, or 12-megapixel 2x zoom photos. \nSharp (perhaps overly so), detailed, with accurate colors: A typical iPhone photo.  Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable\nIt's not quite the same as having two cameras, and low light performance can be sketchy. But what you need to know is that the iPhone 16e's camera is not an afterthought like it was on the iPhone SE. Most of the time, you'll get sharp, vibrant photos, and the default, 24-megapixel resolution will give you plenty of detail. \nBy default, the iPhone 16e takes 24-megapixel photos. But if the conditions are good, you can turn it up to 48 megapixels for those extra details", "title": "Apple's iPhone 16e, priced starting at $599, offers A18 chip performance, a 6.1-inch OLED display, and improved battery life over prior affordable models, positioning it as a modern alternative to the discontinued iPhone SE despite higher pricing.", "summary": "The Apple iPhone 16e marks a significant shift in Apple's approach to its affordable iPhone line, offering a device that's on par with its flagship models in terms of design, performance, and features.

The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like having two cameras in one, so users can zoom in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, Apple\u2019s groundbreaking satellite features \u2014 including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and Find My via satellite \u2014 help iPhone 16e users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. \nThat's right \u2014 Apple's in-house cellular modem has finally arrived. The company has been working toward this for _years_ after buying Intel's smartphone modem business back in 2019.\nThe 16e starts at $599 for a 128 GB model, and tops out at $899 with 512 GB of space, and replaces the iPhone SE,1 which started at $429 with just 64 GB of space. That's a pretty big price bump, even if the 16e modernizes Apple's cheapest phone in a bunch of ways. The 16e's 6.1-inch OLED display comes with a Face ID notch, marking the end of Touch ID on the iPhone. That OLED display isn't as bright as what comes on the mainstream iPhone 16, and doesn't support the 16's low-light 1 nit minimum brightness capability.\nThe phone comes with an Action Button, but no Camera Control.\nAnd of course, the 16e's A18 processor means this phone supports Apple Intelligence. The A18 in the regular iPhone 16 has a 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU, while the 16e has just 4 GPU cores. Despite the lack of Camera Control, Visual Intelligence is still present, now through the Action button.\nOut back, the 16e has just one camera lens, but does Apple's zoom/cropping trick to offer both 1x and 2x options.\nSadly, the 16e doesn't seem to include MagSafe support, but rather just Qi wireless charging up to 7.5 watts. Apple's own case for the 16e also lack MagSafe, but I'm sure third-parties will come up with solutions.\nIn the product video, Tim Cook says this phone \"completes the iPhone 16 family,\" which is interesting positioning. The SE was kind out of there on its own, but what will happen to the 16e once the 17 line rolls out? Will we see an iPhone 17e this fall, or a year from now?\nTime will tell what Apple's plan is here. For now, the 16e offers a slightly cut-down iPhone 16 experience starting at $200 less than the iPhone 16 itself.\n* * *\n  1.

I don\u2019t know. For some reason, I used to hear about them all the time. Why are they making a comeback? What\u2019s what\u2019s the new found interest in that?\n[00:00:18] **Lee Jackson:** Well, number one, the 15 year stretch we had from 2008 to a couple of years ago, there was zero interest rates.\n[00:00:28] **Lee Jackson:** So municipal bonds, for those who aren\u2019t aware, are the bonds that are issued by your local city, your state, your county, to fund activity within the city, state, and county. And it can be for roads. It can be for other infrastructure. It can be for numerous things. But for the last 15 years, the yields on munis, which are lower than corporate bonds, the rate of, you know, triple A, double A bonds are, you know, a good 60 to a hundred basis points lower. So I think they just weren\u2019t attractive from a year, the yield standpoint. But now that we had a big run up from zero to over five, you know, it\u2019s come back in over the last year, I think they\u2019re attractive. And again, if you live in a state like New York or California, there is municipal bond funds that are just California bonds, and those are not subject to state income tax.\n[00:01:26] **Lee Jackson:** And federal income tax. And in some cases, if you live in New York, it\u2019s the same thing. So I think it\u2019s a good idea for people to at least consider it because, they\u2019re tax free. You don\u2019t pay one penny of tax on that income. And again, rates probably won\u2019t go much lower than they are now. I mean they just can\u2019t lower rates tremendously from here because inflation won\u2019t go away and the fed knows that and as much as the president wants rates to be lower. He knows in his in his heart of hearts that they really can\u2019t lower rates drastically So it\u2019s certainly something to consider and you can buy them individually with a single bond that, you know, trades at par, which is usually a thousand initially.\n[00:02:11] **Lee Jackson:** Or you can buy them in a mutual fund from big companies like Fidelity or, or Franklin Templeton. Or you can buy them in an ETF, which is an exchange traded fund, which is a little more helpful simply because you can buy and sell those anytime of day.\nThe post Dividend and Income Investors Forgot About Munis, But Today They Make Perfect Sense appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "title": "Municipal bonds have regained appeal for high-income investors in high-tax states due to rising interest rates, offering tax-free returns accessible via ETFs or funds from Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.", "summary": "Rising interest rates have increased the appeal of municipal bonds (munis) for high-income investors, particularly in states like California and New York, due to their tax-free payouts.

The iPad Pro series has always delivered, and the latest M4 models take things even further with more refinements than ever before. And while the 11-inch model is usually priced at $999, you can now score an impressive discount that takes $150 off, dropping it down to its lowest price at $849.\nRelated\n#####  iPad Pro (M4, 2024) review: The best tablet in the world gets better, but by how much? \nThe new iPad Pro with M4 is the most capable and powerful tablet on the market. But is it that much better than the M2 iPad Pro? \nPosts\n##  What's great about the iPad Pro? \nThe iPad Pro is just one of those tablets that's extremely overpowered and can really do anything. Not only that, but it's also really sleek, has a beautiful screen, and fantastic battery life as well. This model on sale features an Apple M4 chip and 256GB of internal storage.\nFurthermore, you also get a fantastic 11-inch OLED display that features vibrant colors and excellent black levels. But what really takes the experience over the top is access to some of the best apps and games that you'll find on mobile. It also doesn't hurt that iPadOS has gotten better over time, making it possible to do both simple and complex tasks on a tablet. \nPlus, you can always take things up a notch by adding a keyboard or stylus, making the tablet even more versatile when it comes to daily use. We don't think this tablet is going to be a complete laptop replacement, but it gets pretty close. There's also decent connectivity as well with USB-C, Bluetooth 5.3, and Wi-Fi 6E.\nLet's not forget about the cameras on this tablet as well. You get a front-facing 12MP camera, and dual cameras on the rear with a 12MP wide angle, and 10MP ultrawide. The important thing is that this tablet will be around for a while, and Apple will continue to support it for years to come, which means that this is going to be a sound investment if you're looking for a tablet. \n  * NAS, IOT, and everything else\n  * Apple\n\n\nFollow \nFollowed \nShare\nReaders like you help support XDA.

The device features an all-new design paired with the A18 chip inside, a 48MP camera, and full Apple Intelligence support. It also features the first-ever Apple-designed 5G cellular modem, the C1 chip. \nThe new iPhone 16e starts at $599 for 128GB and will be available to pre-order Friday, with the first orders arriving on February 28. \n## iPhone 16e specs and features\nThe iPhone 16e features a 6.1-inch OLED display with a notch. There\u2019s also Face ID support integrated into that notch. You\u2019ll find a USB-C port at the bottom for charging and data transfer. The device also features the Action button instead of the classic mute switch. \nIn terms of performance, the iPhone 16e is powered by the latest A18 chip. Apple says the 6-core CPU is up to 80 percent faster than the A13 Bionic chip on iPhone 11. There\u2019s also a 4-core CPU and a 16-core Neural Engine. Apple says the Neural Engine \u201cis optimized for large generative models and runs machine learning (ML) models up to 6x faster than A13 Bionic.\u201d \nAs such, the new iPhone 16e offers full support for Apple Intelligence. This includes things like Genmoji, Writing Tools, Clean Up in the Photos app, ChatGPT integration, and more. You can access Visual Intelligence via the Action button or via a new toggle in Control Center. \nNotably, the iPhone 16e features the C1 modem, the first cellular modem designed by Apple. The company says: \n> Expanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon \u2014 including C1 \u2014 the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life.\nOn the back of the iPhone 16e, you\u2019ll find a single 48MP Fusion camera with an integrated 2x Telephoto option. By default, the iPhone 16e will take high-resolution 24MP photos, but you can also choose to take 48MP images. The integrated 2x Telephoto option lets you zoom in and retain that high-resolution image quality without having a second dedicated physical camera. There\u2019s also support for HDR, Portrait mode, and Night mode. \nThe iPhone 16e also features a 12MP True Depth front-facing camera with support for autofocus. \nAs for video quality, the iPhone 16e offers 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 frames per second. It records in Spatial Audio and supports Audio Mix to let users adjust the audio after the fact: \n> iPhone 16e takes stunning videos with the ability to record in 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps, and users can stop and restart a recording for more flexibility when capturing the moment. iPhone 16e also records video in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system, and enables more ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix. Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.\n**More iPhone 16e tidbits:**\n  * Battery life: \u201cThe best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone, lasting up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.\u201d \n    * Up to 26 hours of video playback\n  * Wireless charging support\n  * Satellite connectivity: Messages via satellite, Emergency SOS via satellite, Find My via satellite\n  * Crash Detection support\n\n\n## iPhone 16e pricing and availability\nThe new iPhone 16e will be available for pre-order starting Friday, February 21. The first orders will arrive on Friday, February 28. Pricing starts at $599 for 128GB of storage. It\u2019s available in black and white color options.\nApple has also discontinued the iPhone SE, which was previously the most affordable iPhone in the lineup with a $429 starting price. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have also been removed from Apple\u2019s website. The iPhone 14 will remain available from Apple\u2019s channel partners, while the iPhone 14 Plus has been discontinued entirely. \nThe full iPhone 16e press release is . \n## 9to5Mac\u2019s Take\nApple\u2019s newest iPhone is a milestone for several reasons. First, it\u2019s the biggest update ever to Apple\u2019s most affordable iPhone model. \nIt also marks the end of the Home button era. Apple no longer sells any products with a Home button. Instead, they all feature edge-to-edge displays. Every iPhone Apple sells now features Face ID with either a notch or Dynamic Island. The iPad, iPad Air, and iPad mini all have Touch ID embedded in their power buttons, while the iPad Pro features Face ID. \nThe new C1 cellular modem is also a notable accomplishment for Apple. The company has been working on its cellular modem technology for years, which marks the first time we see it in an iPhone. It\u2019s a big step toward Apple reducing \u2013 and eventually eliminating \u2013 its reliance on Qualcomm. \nAnother element to the equation is Apple Intelligence. Apple is betting big on its suite of AI features to spur people to buy new iPhones. Analysts and researchers expect Apple Intelligence to be a big driver for iPhone sales, even as some of the most impressive features aren\u2019t yet available. \nWhat do you think of the new iPhone 16e?

That means you've only got three months left to swap over - if you haven't already jumped ship already.\nAs reported by XDA Developers, a hidden message inside the HMTL code for the Skype for Windows program reads: \"Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams.\" The statement is definitive, capping off the program's two-decade-long run by saying: \"Move to Teams today\" and \"{userCount} of your friends have already moved to Teams\".\nSince its launch in 2003, Skype has been the de facto way of messaging, video conferencing, and audio calls across computers, later adopting mobile platforms, too. It was purchased by Microsoft in 2011, replacing some of the company's services for Skype, such as Windows Live Messenger and others. The program was later attempted to be integrated directly into Windows in 2015, a plan that was never fully realized.\nHowever, Skype ran the risk of being cannibalized alongside Microsoft Teams, the company's newest communications venture, which debuted in 2017. Since its release, Teams has been heavily promoted by the company as the new way to communicate casually and professionally, with a lighter user interface and seamless integration between devices. As a consequence, Skype for Business was officially retired in 2021 after Microsoft announced it would be sunsetting the service in 2019.\nThe final nail in the coffin for Skype was its steep decline that happened during 2020. Despite a rebrand and a facelift from Microsoft, the Zoom alternative saw its numbers slipping significantly from the most popular conferencing program a decade prior, to only around 36 million monthly users, a decrease of 75% percent. While these numbers sound impressive, that's before realizing that Microsoft Teams was averaging anywhere from 250 to 300 million users a month from 2020 onwards and has remained steady since (via CNBC).\n## The end of Skype has finally arrived \nThe news of Skype's closure should not be surprising for many, as the bulk of its users had already long since transitioned to a newer (and likely faster) alternative that could do more. Skype was primarily billed around one-on-one communication, which is now something we've been able to do through Apple's FaceTime, WhatsApp, Discord, Facebook Messenger, and dozens of other programs for desktops and smartphones for a while now. Skype simply has not been needed for a long time, especially once the cracks in its functionality began to show.\nMicrosoft purchased Skype for $8.5 billion in cash with a 300% markup from its original valuation in 2007, when eBay purchased the program for $2.6 billion back in 2007. The service was thought of as the next big thing, which was later integrated into the company's ill-fated Windows phones and was even (briefly) a mandatory part of Windows 10. However, 2011 was a lifetime ago in the age of social media, where so much has arrived to replace it.\nFor all its faults, Microsoft Teams is a frontrunner for professional business use alongside the likes of Zoom and Google Meet. If you're having a video meeting in 2025, it's almost a certainty that you'll be using one of these three instead of booting up Skype, which feels primitive by comparison. Retirement for the program was a long time coming, and frankly, it's surprising that it even lasted this long in the first place.\n### You may also like...\n  * A new split-screen feature is coming to Google Chrome\n  * ChatGPT-4.5 is here for Pro users now and Plus users next week\n  * Valve's upcoming Deckard VR headset rumored to cost $1,200", "title": "Microsoft is discontinuing Skype in May 2025 after its user base plummeted to 36 million, overshadowed by Microsoft Teams' growth to 250-300 million users since 2017.", "summary": "Microsoft has confirmed that Skype will shut down in May 2025, after a two-decade run.

This isn't exactly a follow-up to the iPhone SE from three years ago, though it officially replaces it. Also gone is the iPhone 14, meaning Apple's iPhone lineup now consists of the iPhone 16e, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 series. Apple announced the without much fanfare.\nThe iPhone 16e is available for on February 21 for $599, which effectively eliminates the option of a sub-$500 iPhone. Official sales kick off on February 28. Here's what's new with Apple's latest iPhone.\n## A Modern, \u2018Cheaper\u2019 iPhone\nThe new iPhone 16E, which is a spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, says goodbye to hallmarks like the Touch ID-infused home button and thick bezels around the display in favor of the modern look that's been headlining Apple's iPhones for the past few years. That means an all-screen front, now employing an OLED panel, with Face ID baked into the camera notch.\nUnlike the current iPhone 16 lineup, this iPhone does _not_ use the Dynamic Island system of a floating bar around the front-facing camera that shows live information from apps like Maps and Uber. Here, the camera notch is just a static void. The screen is 6.1 inches, the same size as the iPhone 16, a big leap from the 4.7-inch screen on the third-gen iPhone SE. This is not a tiny phone anymore, a blow to anyone hoping for another small iPhone\u2014especially since Apple killed off the iPhone Mini series a few years ago.\nAnnoyingly, this iPhone is still stuck with a 60-Hz screen refresh rate even though most other smartphones at this price feature a 90- or 120-Hz refresh rate. A higher rate means a smoother experience using the phone with fluid animations. Apple calls this ProMotion, and it's still only available in the iPhone Pro series, though it's expected to arrive in the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus later this year for the first time.\nAlso notable is the switch from a Lightning charging port to a USB-C port. Apple first switched to the universal port on the iPhone 15 range in 2023, and this update means the entire iPhone lineup finally features USB-C. Unfortunately, like the iPhone 16, the port's data transfer speeds remain the same at 480 Mbps. For faster speeds, you'll need to buy the iPhone 16 Pro.\nApple stopped selling the 2022 model of the iPhone SE and other Lightning-based devices in the European Union in December 2024 to comply with regulations that required the universal USB-C port on devices like phones and tablets. The earlier-than-expected release of the iPhone 16e suggests Apple wanted to quickly fill in the gap and bring a low-cost iPhone back to that market.\nSpecs| iPhone 16e (2025)  \n---|---  \nDisplay:| 6.1 inches, OLED, 60 Hz  \nBuild:| Aluminum and Ceramic Shield  \nProcessor and RAM:| Apple A18 with 8 GB of RAM  \nStorage:| 128, 256, and 512 GB  \nCameras:| 48-megapixel main camera, 12-MP selfie camera  \nExtras:| Qi wireless charging, Face ID, USB-C  \nColors:| Black, White  \nPrice:| $599  \nApple's A18 chipset sits inside with 8 GB of RAM, meaning you get the same power as the iPhone 16. Nearly. This chipset has one less GPU core than the A18 inside the iPhone 16, meaning there may be a slight hit to graphics performance when playing games. Naturally, the A18 chip brings access to Apple Intelligence. It's the most affordable iPhone with the suite of AI features, though it's not the cheapest way to access it. That would be the $499 iPad Mini.\nWhile Apple has brought over the Action Button from the higher-end iPhones\u2014this user-customizable button replaced the mute switch and debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro\u2014the 16e is missing the Camera Control button found on those flagship devices.\nCamera Control is the fifth physical button on the iPhone 16 lineup. It enables quick access to the camera and allows users to slide a finger on it to change shooting modes. Pressing and holding the button activates Apple\u2019s Visual Intelligence, which lets Siri understand what it's looking at, provide context, and take action. Apple initially restricted the feature to the new iPhone 16 range which has the physical Camera Control button, even if the iPhone 15 Pro was capable of this computer vision trick. However, the iPhone 16e can now make use of Visual Intelligence through the Action Button. It's unclear yet if this functionality will make its way to the iPhone 15 Pro.\nSpeaking of the camera, it's been upgraded to a 48-megapixel sensor, and Apple touts that the higher megapixel count allows the camera to crop in and offer a 2X optical-like image quality\u2014effectively giving you the experience of two camera lenses in one. The selfie camera is the same 12 megapixels as the rest of the iPhone 16 series.\nThe other big introduction is Apple's first in-house 5G modem, the C1. This new chip further reduces the company's dependence on external chip suppliers like Qualcomm. This modem won't allow the iPhone 16e to connect to millimeter-wave 5G\u2014the superfast 5G speeds you'll find in certain locations, like dense urban areas, airports, or stadiums. This is a common omission on phones within this price range, which rely on the more widespread sub-6 GHz 5G spectrum.\nApple says the new C1 modem helps improve battery life. The iPhone 16e's battery can last 21 hours when streaming videos, which is 11 more hours than the iPhone SE, and it's even better than the 18-hour claim for the same-sized iPhone 16. Bizarrely, Apple did not add Qi2 and MagSafe functionality to this iPhone, gatekeeping its magnetic accessory system to pricier devices. The iPhone 16e still supports Qi wireless charging, which is slower and doesn't have the benefits of magnets.\nWhat it does retain are the satellite communication features that debuted in the iPhone 14\u2014when you're away from cellular coverage and Wi-Fi, you can message friends and family via satellite and also connect to emergency services and roadside assistance. You can also share your location via satellite through the Find My app. The iPhone 16e also includes Apple's Crash Detection, which can contact emergency services if the device detects you've been in a car crash.\nThe iPhone 16e makes the iPhone lineup a little confusing because Apple still sells the , which are more expensive but have a weaker processor that lacks access to Apple Intelligence. Unless you really want an ultrawide camera, MagSafe, or the Dynamic Island, there doesn't seem to be much reason to buy them anymore.\n## Comments\nBack to Top\nJoin the WIRED community to add comments.\nSign in or create account\n## You Might Also Like \u2026\n  * **In your inbox:** Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear\n  * Musk takeover: DOGE\u2019s race to the bottom\n  * **Big Story:** The bust that took down Durov and upended Telegram\n  * WIRED\u2019s favorite \u2018buy it for life\u2019 gear\n  * **Event:** Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London\n\n\nJulian Chokkattu is a senior reviews editor at WIRED, and has been covering personal technology and reviewing consumer products for nearly a decade.

Instead of the widely anticipated iPhone SE 4, the company unveiled the new iPhone 16e, which shifts to a full-screen design with Face ID while putting Apple Intelligence on an entry-level model for the first time. It also sports the Action button, which debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro. Pre-orders for the iPhone 16e are now open, with models starting at , and the phone will be more widely available on February 28. Here's everything you need to know about pre-ordering the latest iPhone.\nThe best place to get an unlocked iPhone 16e is, unsurprisingly, direct from Apple. The iPhone 16e comes in only two colors, black and white, with 128GB, 256GB and 512GB storage configurations to choose from. Ordering an unlocked iPhone means you can take it to nearly any carrier of your choosing.\nAs usual, wireless carriers are also selling the iPhone 16e now, with various perks attached to purchases. Here are all of wireless carrier specials we currently know about for the iPhone 16e.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\n  * : New customers can save $420 when you order the iPhone 16e and sign up for a new plan. Existing customers can also save $420 if they add a new line when buying the iPhone 16e.\n  * : All customers can get the iPhone 16e for $5.99/month with any unlimited plan. No trade-in required. also carries the iPhone 16e for AT&T customers, with monthly payments starting at $15.25.\n  * : Get an iPhone 16e \"on us\" (or up to $830 off) when trading in an eligible device on Magenta Max, Go5G Plus/Next or when trading in and adding a line on Go5G or most plans. You can also get $500 off the iPhone 16e when trading in an eligible device on Go5G or most plans.\n  * : Get the new iPhone 16e for just $200 when you switch to Boost and sign up for the Unlimited Premium plan ($60/month).\n\n\nThe iPhone 16e looks much like the iPhone 14, one of Apple's 2022 models. The new phone has a much larger screen than previous iPhone SE \u2014 a spacious 6.1 inches \u2014 along with Face ID and swipe-based multitasking gestures. (The model it replaces had a Touch ID home button.) It has a notch at the top of the screen, not the floating Dynamic Island from higher-end iPhones.\nApple Intelligence is increasingly central to the company's strategy, so don't be surprised to see Apple's iPhone 16e marketing center around it. In addition to zippy performance, the phone's A18 chip enables features like generative AI writing tools, Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, ChatGPT integration and notification summaries. The phone is the cheapest entry point into Apple Intelligence by hundreds of dollars.\nThe phone has a 48-megapixel Fusion \"2-in-1\" camera with a 2x telephoto system. Compared to the more expensive iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, the SE's lack of extra rear cameras is one of the most noticeable things you'll miss out on.\nAt $599, the iPhone 16e is also $150 more than previous iPhone SE models, which typically cost around $429. Meanwhile, the , and the additional $200 gets you a better camera system and a more modern design.\n## \nLatest Stories\n  * Engadget\n#### OpenAI bans Chinese accounts using ChatGPT to edit code for social media surveillance\nA campaign with likely affiliations with China saw a company attempt to use ChatGPT to edit code for a social media surveillance tool.\n  * Engadget\n#### Can somebody let this robot down?\nThe Clone Robotics Protoclone has synthetic muscles that let it kick its legs and flex its arms.\n  * Engadget\n#### Bybit hacked for almost $1.5 billion in the biggest crypto theft ever\nA hacker took control of one of the exchange's offline wallets, transferring it to an unknown party.

That is a pretty huge effect on health,\u201d said study lead author Yu Zhang, research assistant at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and a student in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard Chan School.\nButter is rich in saturated fatty acids, while plant-based oils have more unsaturated fatty acids. There have been many studies on dietary fatty acids, but fewer studies have focused on their primary food sources, including butter and oils.\n> \u201cEven cutting back butter a little and incorporating more plant-based oils into your daily diet can have meaningful long-term health benefits.\u201d \n> Daniel Wang, Brigham and Women\u2019s\nThe new study analyzed dietary data from 221,054 participants in the , Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Every four years, the study participants answered questions about how often they had certain types of food. The researchers used the data to estimate participants\u2019 consumption of butter and plant oils, including butter and margarine blends, spreadable butter added to food and bread, and butter used in baking and frying. Intake of plant-based oils was estimated based on the reported use in frying, saut\u00e9ing, baking, and salad dressing.\nThe researchers also identified participants who had died and their causes of death. Using statistics to compare death rates across different diet intake levels, the researchers found that participants who ate the most butter had a 15 percent higher risk of dying than those who ate the least. In contrast, those who ate the most plant-based oils had a 16 percent lower risk of death than those who ate the least.\n\u201cPeople might want to consider that a simple dietary swap \u2014 replacing butter with soybean or olive oil \u2014 can lead to significant long-term health benefits,\u201d said corresponding author Daniel Wang of the Channing Division. Wang is also an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Chan School and an associate member at the Broad Institute. \u201cFrom a public health perspective, this is a substantial number of deaths from cancer or from other chronic diseases that could be prevented.\u201d\nThe researchers also did a substitution analysis, which mimics how swapping butter for plant oils would impact health in a feeding trial. They found that substituting 10 grams of butter a day (less than a tablespoon) with equivalent calories of plant-based oils could lower cancer deaths and overall mortality by 17 percent.\n\u201cEven cutting back butter a little and incorporating more plant-based oils into your daily diet can have meaningful long-term health benefits,\u201d Wang said.\nOne limitation of the study is that the participants are mainly health professionals, so they might not represent the U.S. population as a whole, the researchers said. In the future, they\u2019d like to study the biological mechanisms underlying why this dietary change has such a large impact.\nIn addition to Zhang and Wang, Mass General Brigham authors include Katia S.

It's called the iPhone 16e, which picks up where the iPhone SE leaves off \u2013 and it's all about serving up the latest iPhone features at a more affordable price tag.\nThe 16e features much of what we liked about the standard iPhone 16, including a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with support for HDR \u2013 presumably the Dolby Vision variety, as is the case with every iPhone since the X in 2018.\nApple quotes a resolution of 2532x1170, a pixel density of 460ppi, and a peak brightness of 1200 nits for HDR content (800 nits typical brightness for everything else). Furthermore, it features trimmed-down bezels for an edge-to-edge style display and Apple has even resurrected the notch; sorry, no Synamic Island here.\nApple has also stuffed its latest A18 chipset inside, which we found to be a performance champion on the five-star iPhone 16. It also has an exclusive debut chip from Apple, in the form of the C1; which is the company's first in-house designed cellular modem. We're not yet sure how this will affect the phone's 5G performance, however, Apple is promising enhanced power efficiency and \"fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity\".\nElsewhere, the iPhone 16e sports a single 48MP camera, though it features a clever 2-in-1 functionality with an integrated 2x telephoto lens for improved zoomed photography. You'll also find a USB-C socket for charging and wired audio connectivity, the Action Button which can be remapped to fulfil a variety of shortcuts or functions, and Face ID for biometric authentication for unlocking the device or completing purchases.\nThe iPhone 16e runs the latest version of Apple's operating system \u2013 iOS 18 \u2013 with all of the key software features found on the standard iPhone 16. This means that Apple Intelligence is also on board, with a range of AI-powered photo editing, typing and search tools included.\nThere are, however, a couple of surprising Apple-centric omissions. MagSafe is absent, so it won't work with any of your magnetic accessories, and Camera Control (which made its debut on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro) is also nowhere to be found.\nThe design appears to be a fusion of the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 16, with the flat metal rails and notch of the 14 complimenting the matte glass rear and slightly softer tapered edges of the 16. Apple is only offering this handset in two finishes: black and white. It's set to be on sale on 28th February, with pre-orders available now.

The morphological features of phytoliths are diagnostic for many plant taxa, and given their inorganic composition often become part of the fossil record. We use phytolith remains from lacustrine sediments to document the conclusive presence of Arecaceae (palms) in subarctic Canada during the late early Eocene (48 Ma).\nMethods\nPalm phytoliths and aquatic microfossils were extracted from lacustrine mudstones in a drill core taken from the Giraffe kimberlite pipe locality using a combination of acid and oxidation treatments under low heat. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to identify, examine, and image the microfossils.\nKey Results\nSpherical echinate-shaped palm phytoliths with cone-shaped surface tubercles, likely belonging to the tribe Trachycarpeae (subfamily Coryphoideae), were uncovered in 45 strata over a 37-meter section of core. We further document _in-situ_ linear arrays of phytoliths, or stegmata, from partially-decomposed palm foliage. Additionally, four aquatic organisms, largely restricted to warm subtropical and tropical localities today, were also uncovered in the same strata harboring the palm phytoliths.\nConclusions\nThe presence of palm phytoliths allows inference of a warm regional climate during the late early Eocene, with mean cold-month temperatures above freezing despite prolonged winter darkness. This conclusion is supported by the presence of multiple warm water aquatic organisms that grew extensively in the maar lake. Our findings will help to document the extent and timing of perennial ice formation in the northern hemisphere during the Cenozoic. Finally, the discovery of stegmata documents that this morphological trait had evolved by early Eocene\n, , , , , , \nAccepted manuscripts\nAccepted manuscripts are PDF versions of the author\u2019s final manuscript, as accepted for publication by the journal but prior to copyediting or typesetting.

But one glaring omission in its spec sheet makes no sense: Why doesn't this $599 phone have MagSafe?\nDespite looking a lot like an iPhone 14, and using components that are similar to the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16e doesn't support MagSafe or fast wireless charging. Apple expects iPhone 16e owners to be happy with the same wireless charging speeds as an iPhone SE released in 2022, and the slight advantage of using a USB-C port rather than a Lighting port.\nThe iPhone 16e's missing MagSafe feels particularly strange because the feature has been a given for years at this point. Apple introduced MagSafe to its smartphones with the iPhone 12 as a magnetic accessory and charging standard, and has included it in every phone since. MagSafe borrows the name of the magnetic connectors on Apple's laptops, but with some key differences. MagSafe on an iPhone means you have strong built-in magnets that let your phone attaches to cases, mounts, wallets and stands, without any extra fiddly pieces. When you charge over MagSafe, you also get faster charging speeds, bumping things from 7.5W charging to up to 25W charging with the right charging brick.\nMore importantly, using magnets to directly guide a charger to charging coils largely eliminates the possibility of a phone being on a charger but not actually getting charged. It's likely one of the main reasons why MagSafe was adopted into the wider Qi2 wireless charging standard \u2014 it just makes the whole thing a lot more convenient.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nThat doesn't really explain why Apple would leave it out of the iPhone 16e, though. The company's definition of what makes a \"Pro\" feature is always in flux, and it will often will leave features or components out to justify a lower price. But Apple and its partners likely sell a lot of MagSafe accessories, doesn't Apple want to sell those to iPhone 16e owners, too?\nThe interesting wrinkle in all of this is Qi2, which has been available for phone makers to use since 2023, but hasn't seen widespread adoption outside of Apple's phones. Samsung, a company that should have more than enough money to work Qi2 into its flagships, instead offers a case you can buy if you want to use Qi2 charging on the Galaxy S25. Other Android makers are no better: you won't find Qi2 on the Pixel 9, Motorola Razr+ or Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 6. It's possible Qi2 or MagSafe is more expensive (or difficult) to include than it appears, and Apple has been \"generous\" all this time. That might make the decision to not support the standard make more sense. But that doesn't change the fact that the iPhone 16e's lack of MagSafe is very annoying.\n## \nLatest Stories\n  * Engadget\n#### Twitch streamers' uploads and highlights can no longer exceed 100 hours\nTwitch says storage is costly, so it's putting a cap on how much storage a streamer can take up for their uploads and highlight videos.\n  * Engadget\n#### Ring beefs up the image quality on its new Outdoor Cam Plus\nRing adds yet another model to its range of outdoor security cameras.\n  * Engadget\n#### Lenovo Legion Go S review (Windows version): Not so fast\nThe Lenovo Legion Go S will be the first third-party gaming handheld to run SteamOS, but it won't be out until May.

Maxx \u2013 It\u2019s Terrific\u2019\n\nWe recently published a list of **Jim Cramer\u2019s Thoughts on These 5 Stocks**. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\nOn Tuesday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the current state of the market, especially about AI stocks. He noted that despite the enthusiasm surrounding AI, investors are no longer willing to pay high prices for stocks tied to this technology. Cramer explained that on days like Tuesday, people in the market are feeling what he referred to as \u201cpainful shrinkage.\u201d\n> \u201cIn this business, shrinkage means paying less for the same earnings that you were willing to pay up for only just a week or two ago.\u201d\n**READ ALSO:****7 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar****and****Jim Cramer Put These 10 Stocks Under the Spotlight**\nHe pointed out that this phenomenon is commonly known as price-to-earnings multiple compression, a widespread trend across the market. Cramer asked why this is happening, especially when it seems like nothing has changed with the companies themselves. He explained:\n> \u201cLook, when everyone\u2019s terrified that a piano\u2019s about to fall on their heads, they don\u2019t want to get hit by the baby grand and right now they don\u2019t want to own the falling stocks either. So they sell but they can\u2019t get a good price anymore because too many people want out for the same reasons. They think that stocks are overpriced versus when we consider what could lay ahead.\u201d\nCramer further elaborated that there is a strong sense of apprehension in the market right now, with investors bracing for potential economic challenges. Despite good news that may come out about companies or the economy, people are reluctant to hold onto stocks because they are anticipating weakness down the road.\nHe said that even though they cannot see it clearly, the ongoing concerns about the economy and the administration\u2019s messaging about necessary economic adjustments create a climate of fear. As Cramer put it, \u201cIf the administration keeps talking about how we\u2019re transitioning, how the economy needs to make some painful adjustments, then any big rally that we had Friday and yesterday will become magnets for sellers.\u201d\n> \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: This latest round of multiple compression came on a day of wonderment about artificial intelligence, and even with Jensen\u2019s fabulous speech, multiple compression was just much more powerful. You know what? It\u2019s going to stay that way until we get through this environment, either because the White House backs off, or because stocks come down to the point where we simply get used to it.\u201d\n### **Our Methodology**\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 5 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 18. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (**see more details here**).\nA busy retail store floor with customers trying on apparel and browsing the products. \n### **The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:****TJX****)**\n**_Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74_**\nThe TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) was mentioned during the episode, and here\u2019s what Cramer had to say about the company:\n> \u201cI love T.J. Maxx. I mean, come on. I bought some this week for the Charitable Trust. I think it\u2019s terrific. I think it\u2019s going right back to $125.\u201d\nTJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) is a discount retailer known for its diverse selection of products, including family clothing, home goods, jewelry, and more. Bretton Fund stated the following regarding The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n> \u201cPre-pandemic, The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) and Ross were usually in lockstep operationally and performance-wise. The main difference is TJX is much larger and has more divisions: TJ Maxx has higher-end goods; Marshalls has lower price points and is very similar to Ross; HomeGoods and Homesense offer furniture and household goods. But as inflation spiked up, TJX was better able to push through price increases, helped in part due to its relatively higher-income shoppers being less sensitive to inflation. TJX\u2019s earnings growth and share price have outperformed Ross the past few years, but we expect that to converge in the near term. TJX\u2019s and Ross\u2019s earnings increased an estimated 9% and 11%, respectively, and their stocks returned 31% and 10%.\u201d\nOverall, TJX ****ranks 4th**** on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of TJX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Policy professionals want , but most expect it be several years before governments can effectively intervene.\n\u201cThere has been much movement around adoption and regulating AI, yet we don\u2019t have standard definitions for its critical elements,\u201d Saira Jesani, D&TA executive director said in announcing the organization\u2019s standards. \u201cThe consequences \u2014 from copyright infringement to privacy to authenticity \u2014 could affect both the technology\u2019s business value and its acceptance.\u201d\nIBM tested the standards internally last year, aligning the committee\u2019s recommendations with its governance policies. The company reported a \u201cconsistent and quantifiable impact on the overall efficiency of our data diligence and management processes,\u201d Christina Montgomery, chief privacy and trust officer at IBM, said in .\nThe technical committee will look to improve on the existing standards while generating momentum for implementation tools. Podnar said she thinks the current version covers most but not all the standardization issues that should be addressed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 80% there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew that we didn't get this 100% right and that we were going to have to evolve the standards.\u201d\nOnce the technical committee convenes, the organization intends to bring additional members on board. The sponsoring companies are aiming to have metadata quality metrics ready for broad usage within 12 to 18 months, according to Podnar.\n\u201cThey're not interested in having this take a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want tools in the marketplace.\u201d\n  *   * purchase licensing rights\n\n\nFiled Under: Strategy\n### Cybersecurity Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n###  Editors' picks \n  * ###  Change Healthcare cyberattack: 5 technical takeaways from UnitedHealth CEO\u2019s testimony \nChange Healthcare was running on legacy technology, which magnified the ransomware attack\u2019s impact and hampered recovery efforts, Andrew Witty said.\nBy Matt Kapko \u2022 May 6, 2024\n  * Deep Dive \n###  Are cybersecurity professionals OK? \nAbsorbing the impacts of cyberattacks takes a personal toll on defenders.

Apple Maps EV routing is supported on three the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Ford F-150 Lightning, and the Porsche Taycan. Last year, shipping adapters that allow Mach-E and Lightning drivers to charge at Tesla Superchargers, which use the NACS connector. \nApple Maps, however, hasn\u2019t been updated with knowledge of this change. This means Apple Maps EV routing will only route Mach-E and Lightning drivers to CCS charging stations, completely unaware of the fact that they can also charge at NACS stations. \nIn January, Ford addressed this limitation and confirmed that Tesla Supercharger locations would be coming to Apple Maps EV routing. \nApple released iOS 18.4 beta two for developers today. Inside that beta, Aaron Perris has evidence that Apple is addressing this problem. \nAccording to code found in iOS 18.4, Apple Maps EV routing will have knowledge of the fact that certain cars can charge at Tesla NACS stations. When planning a route, Apple Maps will show you messages like: \u201cYou need to use a charging adapter on this route\u201d and \u201cTesla NACS Adapter Required.\u201d \nThe feature isn\u2019t turned on yet, but it\u2019s expected to be enabled in a future iOS 18.4 beta. Presumably, there will be a way for drivers to tell Apple Maps they have an adapter for route planning purposes. We\u2019ll have to wait for the feature to officially launch to know for sure. \niOS 18.4 will be released to everyone in April. As we previously reported, iOS 18.4 also updates the CarPlay layout to include an extra row of apps on the home screen for select cars.\nAs a refresher, the Apple Maps EV routing feature assists in planning trips by automatically incorporating essential charging stops along your route. It monitors your car\u2019s charge level and considers various factors to determine the optimal time and duration for charging. These factors include the availability and speed of chargers, elevation changes, your driving speed, and more.\n_If you\u2019re an electric vehicle owner, charge up your car at home with rooftop solar panels.
